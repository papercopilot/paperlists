        "abstract": "This  paper  presents  a  novel  and  fast  k-NN  classifier  that  is  based  on  a  binary  CMM  (Correlation  Matrix  Memory)  neural  network.  A  robust  encoding  method  is  developed  to  meet  CMM  input  requirements .  A  hardware implementation of the CMM is  described, which gives  over 200  times  the  speed  of a  current  mid-range  workstation,  and  is  scaleable  to  very  large  problems.  When  tested  on  several  benchmarks  and  compared  with a simple k-NN method, the CMM classifier gave  less than  I %  lower  accuracy  and  over  4  and  12  times  speed-up  in  software  and  hardware  respectively.",

Associative  multiplication,  the  process  of doing  multiplication  by  memory  without the  use  of rules  or algorithms,  is  especially  problematic.  Humans  exhibit  certain  characteristic  phenomena in  performing associative  multiplications,  both in  the  type of error and  in  the error frequency.  We  propose a  model  for  the  process  of associative  multiplication,  and  compare  its  perfor(cid:173) mance  in  both  these  phenomena  with  data from  normal  humans  and from  the model proposed  by  Anderson  et al (1994).",

        "abstract": "There  has  been  much  recent  work  on  measuring  image  statistics  and  on  learning  probability  distributions  on  images.  We  observe  that  the  mapping  from  images  to  statistics  is  many-to-one  and  show  it  can  be  quantified  by  a  phase  space  factor.  This  phase  space approach throws light on the Minimax Entropy technique for  learning Gibbs distributions on images with potentials derived from  image statistics and elucidates the ambiguities that are inherent to  determining the potentials.  In  addition, it shows that if the phase  factor  can  be  approximated  by  an  analytic  distribution  then  this  approximation  yields  a  swift  \"Minutemax\"  algorithm  that  vastly  reduces  the  computation  time  for  Minimax entropy  learning.  An  illustration  of this  concept,  using  a  Gaussian  to  approximate  the  phase  factor,  gives  a  good  approximation  to  the  results  of  Zhu  and  Mumford  (1997)  in  just  seconds  of  CPU  time.  The  phase  space  approach  also  gives  insight  into  the  multi-scale  potentials  found  by  Zhu and Mumford  (1997)  and suggests that the forms  of  the potentials are influenced greatly by phase space considerations.  Finally,  we  prove  that probability distributions  learned  in  feature  space  alone  are  equivalent  to  Minimax  Entropy  learning  with  a  multinomial approximation of the phase factor.",

Recently, we  [1]  have offered a new approach by  defining principal curves as continuous curves of a  given length which  minimize the expected squared distance between the curve and points of  the space randomly chosen according to  a given distribution.  The new  definition made it possible to carry out a theoretical analysis of learning  principal curves from training data.

Simulation results demonstrate  that the new algorithm compares favorably with previous methods both  in terms of performance and computational complexity.",

        "abstract": "Structure in  a visual  scene can  be  described at many levels of granular(cid:173)\nity.  At a coarse level,  the  scene is  composed of objects;  at  a finer level, \neach object is made up of parts, and the parts of subparts. In this  work, I \npropose a simple principle by  which  such hierarchical  structure can  be \nextracted from  visual scenes: Regularity in the relations among different \nparts of an  object is  weaker than in  the  internal  structure of a part. This \nprinciple  can  be  applied  recursively  to  define  part-whole  relationships \namong elements  in  a scene.  The principle does  not make use  of object \nmodels,  categories,  or  other  sorts  of  higher-level  knowledge;  rather, \npart-whole relationships  can  be  established based  on  the  statistics  of a \nset of sample visual  scenes. I illustrate with a model that performs unsu(cid:173)\npervised  decomposition  of simple  scenes.  The  model  can  account  for \nthe  results from  a human  learning experiment on  the  ontogeny  of part(cid:173)\nwhole relationships.",

Thus  it  provides  a  common  framework for  all  these  methods.  Our  graph-based  method  differs  from  existing  stochastic  methods  which  are  based  on  analogy  to  physical  systems.  The  stochastic  nature  of our  method  makes  it  more  robust  against  noise,  including  accidental  edges  and  small  spurious clusters.  We demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm  using  an example with  3 spiraling bands and  a  lot of noise.",

Unique features  of targets enable them  to pop out against the background, while targets defined by lacks of  features or conjunctions of features are more difficult to spot.  It is  known that the ease of target detection can change when the roles  of figure  and  ground  are  switched.  The  mechanisms  underlying  the  ease  of  pop  out  and  asymmetry  in  visual  search  have  been  elusive.

        "abstract": "We  introduce  a  novel  framework  for  simultaneous  structure  and  parameter  learning  in  hidden-variable conditional probability models,  based on an  en tropic  prior and  a solution  for its maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator.  The MAP estimate minimizes uncertainty  in  all  respects:  cross-entropy  between  model  and  data;  entropy  of the  model ;  entropy  of  the  data's  descriptive  statistics.  Iterative  estimation  extinguishes  weakly  supported  parameters,  compressing and  sparsifying  the  model.  Trimming operators  accelerate  this  process  by  removing  excess  parameters  and,  unlike  most  pruning  schemes,  guarantee  an  increase  in  posterior  probability.  Entropic  estimation  takes  a  overcomplete  random  model  and simplifies  it,  inducing the  structure of relations  between  hidden  and  observed  variables.  Applied  to  hidden  Markov  models  (HMMs),  it  finds  a  concise  finite-state  machine  representing  the  hidden  structure  of a  signal.  We  entropically  model  music,  handwriting, and video time-series, and show that the resulting models are highly concise,  structured,  predictive,  and  interpretable:  Surviving  states  tend  to  be  highly  correlated  with meaningful partitions of the data, while surviving transitions provide a low-perplexity  model of the signal dynamics.",

Computation of the singular point for  more general flow  fields  requires  measures of field  expansion and  rotation,  which  it  is  shown can also  be  computed in real-time hardware, again using only the sign of the optical  flow  field.

ERPs  are  usually  averaged  to  increase  their  signal/noise  ratio  relative  to  non-phase  locked  EEG  activ(cid:173) ity,  regardless  of the  fact  that  response  activity  in  single  epochs  may vary  widely  in  time course  and scalp distribution.  This study  applies a linear decomposition tool, Independent Component Anal(cid:173) ysis  (ICA)  [1],  to  multichannel single-trial  EEG  records  to  derive  spatial filters  that  decompose  single-trial  EEG epochs  into  a  sum  of temporally  independent  and spatially fixed  components  arising  from  distinct  or  overlapping  brain  or  extra-brain  networks.  Our  results  on  normal  and  autistic  subjects  show  that  ICA  can  sep(cid:173) arate  artifactual,  stimulus-locked,  response-locked,  and.  non-event  related  background  EEG  activities  into separate  components,  al(cid:173) lowing ( 1) removal of pervasive artifacts of all types from single-trial  EEG records,  and (2) identification of both stimulus- and response(cid:173) locked EEG components.

In  this  paper  we  present  applications  of  this  general  architecture  to  two  problems  in  mammographic  Computer-Aided  Diagnosis  (CAD).  The  first  application  is  the  detection  of  microcalcifications.  The  <:oarse-to-fine  HPNN  was  designed  to learn  large-scale  context  in(cid:173) formation  for  detecting  small objects  like  microcalcifications.  Re(cid:173) ceiver  operating  characteristic  (ROC)  analysis  suggests  that  the  hierarchical  architecture  improves  detection  performance  of a  well  established  CAD  system by  roughly  50 %.  The second  application  is  to detect mammographic masses directly.  Since masses are large,  extended objects,  the coarse-to-fine HPNN architecture is  not suit(cid:173) able for  this  problem.  Instead we  construct  a fine-to-coarse  HPNN  architecture which  is  designed  to  learn  small-scale detail  structure  associated  with  the extended  objects.  Our initial  results  applying  the  fine-to-coarse  HPNN  to  mass  detection  are  encouraging,  with  detection  performance  improvements  of about  36 %.  We  conclude  that the ability of the HPNN architecture to integrate information  across  scales,  both  coarse-to-fine  and  fine-to-coarse,  makes  it  well  suited  for  detecting  objects  which  may  have  contextual  clues  or  detail structure occurring at scales  other than  the  natural scale of  the object.",

        "abstract": "Inference is a key  component in  learning probabilistic models from par(cid:173) tially  observable  data.  When  learning  temporal  models,  each  of the  many  inference phases requires a  traversal  over an  entire long data se(cid:173) quence;  furthermore,  the  data structures manipulated are exponentially  large, making this process computationally expensive.  In [2], we describe  an approximate inference algorithm for monitoring stochastic processes,  and prove bounds on its approximation error.  In this paper, we apply this  algorithm as an approximate forward propagation step in an EM algorithm  for learning temporal Bayesian networks.  We provide a related approxi(cid:173) mation for the backward step, and prove error bounds for the  combined  algorithm.  We  show empirically that,  for a real-life domain,  EM  using  our inference algorithm  is  much  faster  than  EM  using exact inference,  with almost no degradation in quality of the learned model.  We  extend  our analysis  to  the  online learning  task,  showing a  bound  on  the  error  resulting  from  restricting  attention  to  a  small  window  of observations.  We  present an  online EM  learning algorithm for  dynamic systems,  and  show that it learns much faster than standard offline EM.",

        "abstract": "A  key question in vision  is  how to represent our knowledge  of previously  encountered objects to classify new ones.  The answer depends on how we  determine  the similarity  of two  objects.  Similarity  tells  us how  relevant  each previously seen object is in determining the category to which a new  object belongs.  Here a  dichotomy  emerges.  Complex notions  of similar(cid:173) ity  appear necessary for  cognitive models  and applications,  while  simple  notions of similarity  form a tractable basis for current computational ap(cid:173) proaches  to classification.  We  explore  the  nature of this dichotomy  and  why  it  calls  for  new  approaches  to  well-studied  problems  in  learning.  We  begin  this  process  by  demonstrating  new  computational  methods  for  supervised  learning  that  can  handle  complex  notions  of similarity.  (1)  We  discuss  how  to  implement  parametric  met.hods  that  represent  a  class  by  its  mean  when  using  non-metric  similarity  functions;  and  (2)  We review  non-parametric  methods  that we  have developed  using  near(cid:173) est  neighbor  classification  in  non-metric  spaces.

A limitation of this approach, however, is  that the tem(cid:173) poral alignment of the basis functions with the underlying structure  in the time series is arbitrary.  We present an algorithm for encoding  a time series that does not require blocking the data.  The algorithm  finds  an efficient  representation by inferring the best temporal po(cid:173) sitions  for  functions  in  a  kernel  basis.  These  can  have  arbitrary  temporal  extent  and  are  not  constrained  to  be  orthogonal.  This  allows the model to capture structure in the signal that may occur  at arbitrary temporal positions and preserves the relative temporal  structure of underlying events.  The model is shown to be equivalent  to a  very sparse and highly over complete basis.  Under this model,  the mapping from  the data to the representation is  nonlinear,  but  can  be  computed  efficiently.  This form  also  allows  the  use  of ex(cid:173) isting methods for  adapting the basis itself to data.  This approach  is  applied to speech data and results in a shift invariant, spike-like  representation that resembles coding in the cochlear nerve.",

The com(cid:173) putation of optical flow  is  an ill-posed problem, which expresses itself as  the aperture problem.  However, the optical flow  can be estimated by the  use of regularization methods, in  which additional constraints are intro(cid:173) duced in  terms of a global energy functional that must be minimized . We  show how the algorithmic constraints of Hom and Schunck [2]  on com(cid:173) puting smooth optical flow can be mapped onto the physical constraints  of an equivalent electronic network.",

Using a recurrent  neural  network of excitatory spiking neurons with adapting synapses we  show  that both effects could  be  explained  by  a fast  and  a slow compo(cid:173) nent in the synaptic adaptation.  (i) Fast synaptic depression leads to sat(cid:173) uration  of the CRF and  phase  advance  in  the cortical  response to  high  contrast stimuli.  (ii) Slow adaptation of the synaptic transmitter release  probability is derived such that the mutual information between the input  and  the output of a cortical neuron  is  maximal.  This component-given  by  infomax learning rule-explains contrast adaptation of the averaged  membrane  potential  (DC  component)  as  well  as  the surprising experi(cid:173) mental  result,  that  the  stimulus  modulated component  (Fl  component)  of a cortical cell's membrane potential adapts only weakly. Based on our  results,  we propose a new  experiment to estimate the strength of the ef(cid:173) fective  excitatory  feedback  to  a  cortical  neuron,  and  we  also  suggest a  relatively  simple experimental  test to justify our hypothesized synaptic  mechanism for contrast adaptation.",

Regu(cid:173) larization is  done by augmenting the  EM  training method by a penalty  term  that  favors  simple  and  smooth HMM  systems.  The penalty  term  is  constructed as  a mixture model of negative exponential distributions  that is assumed to generate the state dependent emission probabilities of  the HMMs.  This new method is the successful transfer of a well known  regularization approach in neural networks to the HMM domain and can  be interpreted as a generalization of traditional state-tying for HMM sys(cid:173) tems.  The effect of regularization is demonstrated for continuous speech  recognition tasks by improving overfitted triphone models and by speaker  adaptation with limited training data.",

Experiments  show  that  DTs  are  capable  of  generating images that are less blocky, and the models have better  translation  invariance properties  than  a  fixed,  \"balanced\"  TSBN.  We  also show that Simulated Annealing is effective at finding trees  which  have high  posterior probability.",

However, there is as yet little evidence that learning  control by the eNS is through adaptation of one or the other.  Here  we  examine  two  adaptive control  architectures, one  based only on  the inverse model and other based on a combination of forward and  inverse  models.  We  then show that for  reaching movements of the  hand  in  novel  force  fields,  only  the  learning of the  forward  model  results  in  key  characteristics of performance  that match  the  kine(cid:173) matics of human subjects.  In  contrast, the adaptive control system  that relies only on the inverse model fails to produce the kinematic  patterns observed  in  the subjects,  despite the  fact  that it  is  more  stable.  Our results  provide evidence that learning control of novel  dynamics is  via formation of a  forward  model.",

We  define an  ap(cid:173) pearance mapping from examples by constructing a set of independently  smooth interpolation networks; these networks can cover overlapping re(cid:173) gions of parameter space.  A  set  growing  procedure is  used  to  find  ex(cid:173) ample  clusters  which  are  well-approximated  within  their  convex  hull;  interpolation then proceeds only within these sets of examples. With this  method physically valid  images are produced even in regions of param(cid:173) eter space where nearby examples have different appearances.

In  the absence of the  Markov property,  popular reinforcement  learning  algorithms  such  as  Q-Iearning  may  no  longer  be  effective,  and  memory-based  methods  which remove partial observability via state-estimation  are notoriously  expensive.  An alternative approach is  to seek a stochastic memoryless  policy  which  for  each  observation  of  the  environment  prescribes  a  probability  distribution  over  available  actions  that  maximizes  the  average  reward  per  timestep.  A  reinforcement  learning  algorithm  which  learns  a locally optimal  stochastic memoryless  policy has  been  proposed by Jaakkola,  Singh and Jordan,  but not empirically verified.  We present  a variation  of this  algorithm,  discuss  its  implementation,  and demonstrate its viability using four test problems.",

        "abstract": "Learning Real-Time A*  (LRTA*) is a popular control method that interleaves plan(cid:173) ning  and  plan  execution  and  has  been  shown  to  solve  search  problems  in  known  environments efficiently. In this paper, we apply LRTA * to the problem of getting to  a given goal location in an initially unknown environment.  Uninformed LRTA * with  maximal  lookahead always moves  on a  shortest path to the closest unvisited  state,  that is, to the closest potential goal state.  This was believed to be a good exploration  heuristic, but we show that it does not minimize the worst-case plan-execution time  compared to other uninformed exploration methods.  This result is also of interest to  reinforcement-learning researchers  since many  reinforcement learning methods use  asynchronous dynamic  programming,  interleave  planning and  plan  execution,  and  exhibit optimism in the face of uncertainty, just like LRTA *.",

First,  what  kinds  of performance  guar(cid:173) antees  can  be  made  for  Q-learning  after  only  a  finite  number  of actions?  Second,  what  quantitative  comparisons  can  be  made  between  Q-learning  and  model-based  (indirect)  approaches,  which  use  experience  to estimate  next-state  distributions  for  off-line  value  iteration?  We  first  show  that  both  Q-learning  and  the  indirect  approach  enjoy  rather  rapid  convergence  to  the  optimal  policy  as  a  function  of the num(cid:173) ber  of  state  transitions  observed.  In  particular,  on  the  order  of  only  (Nlog(1/c)/c2 )(log(N) + loglog(l/c))  transitions  are  sufficient  for  both  algorithms  to  come  within  c  of the  optimal  policy,  in  an  idealized  model  that  assumes  the  observed  transitions  are  \"well-mixed\"  throughout  an  N-state  MDP.  Thus,  the  two  approaches  have  roughly  the  same  sample  complexity.  Perhaps  surprisingly,  this  sample  complexity  is  far less  than  what is required for the model-based approach to actually construct a good  approximation  to  the  next-state  distribution.  The  result  also  shows  that  the  amount  of memory required  by  the model-based  approach  is  closer  to  N  than  to N 2 \u2022  For  either  approach,  to  remove  the  assumption  that  the  observed  tran(cid:173) sitions  are  well-mixed,  we  consider  a  model  in  which  the  transitions  are  determined by a fixed,  arbitrary exploration policy.  Bounds on the number  of transitions  required  in  order  to  achieve  a  desired  level  of performance  are  then  related  to  the  stationary  distribution  and  mixing  time  of  this  policy.",

The difficulties lie in the Monte-Carlo E-step  which consists of sampling from  the posterior distribution of the hidden  variables given the observations. The new idea presented in this paper is  to generate samples from a Gaussian approximation to the true posterior  from  which it is easy to obtain independent samples.  The parameters  of  the Gaussian approximation are either derived from the extended Kalman  filter or the Fisher scoring algorithm. In case the posterior density is mul(cid:173) timodal  we propose to  approximate the posterior by  a sum of Gaussians  (mixture of modes approach).  We show that sampling from the approxi(cid:173) mate posterior densities obtained by the above algorithms leads to better  models  than  using  point estimates  for  the  hidden  states.  In  our exper(cid:173) iment,  the Fisher scoring algorithm obtained  a better approximation of  the posterior mode than the EKF. For a multimodal distribution, the mix(cid:173) ture of modes approach gave superior results.",

The basic bounds are formulated for a fixed training set.  Simpler expressions are obtained for sampling from an input distri(cid:173) bution  which  equals  the  weight  function  of the covariance kernel,  yielding  asymptotically  tight  results.  The  results  are  compared  with numerical experiments.",

        "abstract": "Calcium (Ca2+)is an ubiquitous intracellular messenger which reg(cid:173) ulates cellular processes, such as secretion, contraction, and cell  proliferation. A number of different cell types respond to hormonal  stimuli with periodic oscillations of the intracellular free calcium  concentration ([Ca2+]i). These Ca2+ signals are often organized  in complex temporal and spatial patterns even under conditions  of sustained stimulation. Here we study the spatio-temporal as(cid:173) pects of intracellular calcium ([Ca 2+]i) oscillations in clonal J3-cells  (hamster insulin secreting cells, HIT) under pharmacological stim(cid:173) ulation (Schofi et al., 1996). We use a novel fast fixed-point al(cid:173) gorithm (Hyvarinen and Oja, 1997) for Independent Component  Analysis (ICA) to blind source separation of the spatio-temporal  dynamics of [Ca2+]i in a HIT-cell. Using this approach we find two  significant independent components out of five differently mixed in(cid:173) put signals: one [Ca2+]i signal with a mean oscillatory period of  68s and a high frequency signal with a broadband power spectrum  with considerable spectral density. This results is in good agree(cid:173) ment with a study on high-frequency [Ca2+]j oscillations (Palus  et al., 1998) Further theoretical and experimental studies have to  be performed to resolve the question on the functional impact of  intracellular signaling of these independent [Ca2+]i signals.",

In this paper, we describe a  Bayesian method for learning invariances based on Lie group theory.  We show  that previous approaches based on first-order Taylor series expansions of inputs  can be regarded as special cases of the Lie group approach, the latter being ca(cid:173) pable of handling in principle arbitrarily large transfonnations. Using a matrix(cid:173) exponential based generative model of images,  we derive an unsupervised al(cid:173) gorithm for learning Lie group operators from  input data containing infinites(cid:173) imal transfonnations.  The on-line unsupervised learning algorithm maximizes  the posterior probability of generating the training data.  We provide experimen(cid:173) tal results suggesting that the proposed method can learn Lie group operators for  handling reasonably large I-D translations and 2-D rotations.",

In  this paper we introduce an extension of the Expectation-Maximization  (EM) algorithm that learns mixture hierarchies in a computationally ef(cid:173) ficient manner. Efficiency is achieved by progressing in a bottom-up  fashion, i.e. by clustering the mixture components of a given level in the  hierarchy to obtain those of the level above. This cl ustering requires onl y  knowledge of the mixture parameters, there being no need to resort to  intermediate samples. In addition to practical applications, the algorithm  allows a new interpretation of EM that makes clear the relationship with  non-parametric kernel-based estimation methods, provides explicit con(cid:173) trol over the trade-off between the bias and variance of EM estimates, and  offers new insights about the behavior of deterministic annealing methods  commonly used with EM to escape local minima of the likelihood.",

We  propose  an  annealed  version  of the  standard  EM  algo(cid:173) rithm for  model fitting  which  is  empirically evaluated  on  a  variety  of data sets from  different  domains.",

The task is divided into two  parts:  orientation discrimination and classification. The key idea is  to perform  the  orientation  discrimination  before  the  classification.  This  can  be  accom(cid:173) plished by hypothesizing, in  turn, that the input image belongs to each class of  interest. The image can then be rotated to  maximize its  similarity to the train(cid:173) ing images in each class (these contain the prototype object in an upright orien(cid:173) tation). This process yields a set of images, at least one of which will have the  object  in  an  upright position.  The resulting  images  can  then be classified by  models  which  have been  trained  with  only  upright examples.  This  approach  has  been  successfully  applied  to  two  real-world  vision-based  tasks:  rotated  handwritten digit recognition and rotated face detection in cluttered scenes.",

While HMMs have a discrete \"hidden\" space con(cid:173) strained by  a fixed  finite-automaton architecture, MALCOM has a con(cid:173) tinuous hidden space-a continuity map-that is  constrained only  by  a  smoothness requirement on paths through the space.  MALCOM fits  into  the same probabilistic framework for speech recognition as  HMMs, but  it represents  a  more  realistic  model  of the  speech  production  process.  To  evaluate the extent to which MALCOM captures speech production  information, we  generated continuous speech continuity maps  for three  speakers  and  used  the  paths  through  them  to  predict measured  speech  articulator data.  The median  correlation  between  the MALCOM paths  obtained from  only the  speech  acoustics  and  articulator measurements  was 0.77 on an  independent test set not used  to train MALCOM or the  predictor.  This  unsupervised  model  achieved  correlations  over speak(cid:173) ers and articulators only 0.02 to 0.15 lower than those obtained using an  analogous supervised method which used articulatory measurements as  well as acoustics ..",

        "abstract": "The learning of many visual perceptual tasks has been shown to be  specific  to practiced stimuli,  while  new  stimuli  require re-Iearning  from  scratch.  Here  we  demonstrate  generalization  using  a  novel  paradigm in motion discrimination  where learning has been previ(cid:173) ously  shown  to  be  specific.  We  trained  subjects  to  discriminate  the  directions  of  moving  dots,  and  verified  the  previous  results  that learning does not transfer from the trained direction to a  new  one.  However,  by  tracking  the  subjects'  performance  across  time  in  the new  direction, we  found  that their rate of learning doubled.  Therefore, learning generalized in  a  task previously considered too  difficult  for  generalization.  We  also  replicated,  in  the  second  ex(cid:173) periment, transfer following  training with  \"easy\"  stimuli.  The specificity  of perceptual learning and  the  dichotomy  between  learning of \"easy\"  vs.  \"difficult\"  tasks were hypothesized to involve  different  learning  processes,  operating  at  different  visual  cortical  areas.  Here we show how to interpret these results in terms of signal  detection  theory.  With  the  assumption  of limited  computational  resources,  we  obtain  the  observed  phenomena  - direct  transfer  and change of learning rate - for increasing levels of task 'difficulty.  It  appears  that  human  generalization  concurs  with  the  expected  behavior of a  generic discrimination system.",

We  have  previously  shown  that main(cid:173) taining network  memory performance  while  synapses  are  deleted,  requires  that  synapses  are  properly  modified  and  pruned,  remov(cid:173) ing the weaker synapses.  We  now show that neuronal regulation , a  mechanism recently  observed  to maintain the average neuronal in(cid:173) put field , results in weight-dependent synaptic modification . Under  the  correct  range  of the  degradation  dimension  and  synaptic  up(cid:173) per  bound,  neuronal  regulation  removes  the  weaker  synapses  and  judiciously  modifies  the  remaining  synapses .  It implements  near  optimal synaptic modification, and  maintains the  memory perfor(cid:173) mance  of a  network  undergoing  massive  synaptic  pruning.  Thus ,  this  paper shows  that  in  addition to the  known effects  of Hebbian  changes,  neuronal  regulation  may  play  an  important  role  in  the  self-organization of brain networks during development.",

The  proportional  aspect  of the  controller is  independently designed  to  be  a  disturbance  attenuator  and  set-point  matching  is  achieved  by  intermittently invoking an integral controller.  The mechanisms  observed in the Angiotensin 11/ AT1  signaling pathway are used to  control the switching of the integral control.  Improved performance  over  PI control is  shown  on  a  model  of cyc1opentenol  production.  A sign change in  plant gain at the desirable operating point causes  traditional  PI  control  to  result  in  an  unstable  system.  Applica(cid:173) tion  of this  new  approach  to  this  problem  results  in  stable exact  set-point matching for  achievable set-points.",

As  opposed  to  standard algorithms for fixed architectures, the optimization at each stage  is  performed over a small  number of parameters, mitigating many of the  difficult numerical problems inherent in  high-dimensional non-linear op(cid:173) timization.  We  establish  upper bounds on  the  error incurred by  the  al(cid:173) gorithm, when approximating functions from the  Sobolev class, thereby  extending previous results  which only provided rates of convergence for  functions in certain convex hulls of functional spaces. By comparing our  results to recently derived lower bounds,  we  show  that the greedy algo(cid:173) rithms  are  nearly  optimal.

Three  models are explored. The first model maintains no inter-pixel dependencies, the  second model is capable of modeling a set of arbitrary pair-wise dependencies,  and the last model allows  dependencies  only  between  neighboring pixels. We  show that for all three of these models, the accuracy of the learned models can  be greatly improved by  augmenting a small number of labeled training images  with  a  large  set of unlabeled  images using  Expectation-Maximization.  This  is  important because it is often difficult to obtain image labels, while many unla(cid:173) beled images  are  readily  available.  Through  a  large  set  of empirical  tests,  we  examine the benefits  of unlabeled data  for  each  of the  models.  By  using only  two randomly selected labeled examples per class, we can discriminate between  the five  facial orientations with an accuracy of 94%; with six labeled examples,  we achieve an accuracy of 98%.",

Less appreciated  is the fact that the same form of amplification can also be used to de-tune  or  broaden selectivity.  Using  a  network  model  with  recurrent  cortical  circuitry,  we  propose  that the  spatial  phase  invariance  of complex  cell  responses  arises  through  recurrent  amplification  of feedforward  input.  Neurons in  the network respond  like simple cells at low  gain and com(cid:173) plex ceUs at high  gain.

Also for noisy data boosting will  try to enforce a  hard  margin and thereby give  too much  weight  to outliers,  which  then  leads to the dilemma of non-smooth fits  and overfitting.  Therefore  we  propose three algorithms to allow for  soft margin classification  by introducing regularization with slack variables into the boosting  concept:  (1)  AdaBoostreg  and  regularized  versions  of  (2)  linear  and  (3)  quadratic programming AdaBoost.

        "abstract": "The task in text retrieval is to find  the subset of a collection of documents relevant  to  a user's  information request,  usually expressed as  a set of words.  Classically,  documents and queries are represented as  vectors of word counts.  In  its  simplest  form, relevance is  defined to be the dot product between a document and  a query  vector-a measure  of the  number of common  terms.  A  central  difficulty  in  text  retrieval  is  that  the  presence or absence  of a  word  is  not sufficient to  determine  relevance to a query. Linear dimensionality reduction has been proposed as a tech(cid:173) nique for extracting underlying structure from  the document collection.  In  some  domains  (such  as  vision)  dimensionality  reduction  reduces  computational com(cid:173) plexity.  In  text retrieval  it is  more often  used  to  improve retrieval  performance.  We  propose  an  alternative  and  novel  technique  that  produces  sparse  represen(cid:173) tations  constructed  from  sets  of highly-related  words.  Documents  and  queries  are  represented  by  their distance  to  these  sets,  and relevance  is  measured by  the  number of common clusters.  This technique significantly improves retrieval  per(cid:173) formance,  is  efficient  to  compute  and  shares  properties  with  the  optimal  linear  projection operator and the independent components of documents.",

We  use  S3 YM  to  solve  the  transduction  problem  using  overall  risk  minimization  (ORM)  posed  by  Yapnik.  The  transduction  problem  is  to  estimate  the  value of a  classification function at the given points in the working  set.  This  contrasts  with  the  standard inductive  learning  problem  of estimating the  classification  function  at  all  possible values  and  then  using  the  fixed  function  to  deduce  the classes  of the working  set  data.  We  propose  a  general  S3YM  model  that minimizes both  the  misclassification  error  and  the  function  capacity  based  on  all  the available data.  We show  how the S3YM  model  for  I-norm lin(cid:173) ear  support  vector  machines  can  be  converted  to  a  mixed-integer  program  and then solved exactly using  integer  programming.  Re(cid:173) sults  of S3YM  and  the  standard  I-norm  support  vector  machine  approach  are  compared  on  ten  data sets.  Our  computational  re(cid:173) sults  support  the statistical  learning  theory  results  showing  that  incorporating  working  data  improves  generalization  when  insuffi(cid:173) cient  training information is  available.

We model the dendrite as an  infinite linear cable, with noise sources distributed along its length.  The  noise sources we consider are thermal noise, channel noise arising from  the stochastic nature of voltage-dependent ionic channels (K+ and Na+)  and synaptic noise due to spontaneous background activity. We assess the  efficacy of information transfer using a signal detection paradigm where  the objective is to detect the presence/absence of a presynaptic spike from  the post-synaptic membrane voltage. This allows us to analytically assess  the role of each of these noise sources in  information transfer.  For our  choice  of parameters,  we find  that the  synaptic  noise  is  the  dominant  noise source which limits the maximum length over which information  be reliably transmitted.",

In  this  paper,  we  show  how  sparse coding can be used for denoising.  Using maximum likelihood  estimation of nongaussian variables corrupted by gaussian noise, we  show  how  to  apply a  shrinkage nonlinearity on  the components  of  sparse coding so  as  to reduce noise.  Furthermore,  we  show  how  to  choose the optimal sparse coding basis for  denoising.  Our method  is  closely  related  to  the  method  of wavelet  shrinkage,  but  has  the  important benefit over wavelet methods that both the features and  the shrinkage parameters are estimated directly from  the data.",

By reformulating the face recognition problem and re(cid:173) interpreting the output of the SVM classifier. we developed a SVM -based  face recognition algorithm.  The face recognition problem is formulated  as a problem in difference space.  which models dissimilarities between  two facial images. In difference space we formulate face recognition as a  two class problem.  The classes are:  dissimilarities between faces  of the  same person.  and dissimilarities between faces  of different people.  By  modifying the interpretation of the decision surface generated by SVM.  we generated a similarity metric between faces  that is learned from ex(cid:173) amples of differences between faces.  The SVM-based algorithm is com(cid:173) pared with a principal component analysis (PeA) based algorithm on a  difficult set of images from the FEREf database. Performance was mea(cid:173) sured for both verification and identification scenarios. The identification  performance for SVM is 77-78% versus 54% for PCA. For verification.  the equal error rate is 7% for SVM and 13 % for PCA.",

In  this  paper  we  apply  an  information theoretic  approach  to  quantify  the  level  of cooperative  activity  among cells  in  a  behavioral  context.  It is  possible to discriminate between  synergetic  activity of the cells  vs .  redundant  activity, depending on the difference  between  the infor(cid:173) mation  they  provide  when  measured  jointly  and  the  information  they  provide independently.  We define  a synergy  value that is  pos(cid:173) itive in the first  case and negative in  the second  and show  that the  synergy value can be measured by detecting the behavioral mode of  the animal from  simultaneously recorded  activity of the  cells.

        "abstract": "Agents  acting  in  the  real  world  are  confronted  with  the  problem  of  making  good  decisions  with  limited  knowledge  of the  environment.  Partially  observable  Markov  decision  processes  (POMDPs)  model  decision problems in which an  agent tries to maximize its reward in  the  face  of limited sensor feedback.  Recent work has shown empirically that  a  reinforcement  learning  (RL)  algorithm  called  Sarsa(A)  can  efficiently  find  optimal  memoryless  policies,  which  map  current  observations  to  actions,  for  POMDP  problems  (Loch  and  Singh  1998).  The  Sarsa(A)  algorithm uses a form  of short-term memory  called an eligibility trace,  which  distributes  temporally  delayed  rewards  to  observation-action  pairs  which  lead  up  to  the  reward.  This  paper  explores  the  effect  of  eligibility traces on the ability of the Sarsa(A) algorithm to find  optimal  memoryless  policies.  A  variant  of  Sarsa(A)  called  k-step  truncated  Sarsa(A)  is  applied to four test  problems taken  from  the  recent  work of  Littman,  Littman,  Cassandra  and  Kaelbling,  Parr  and  Russell,  and  Chrisman.  The  empirical  results  show  that  eligibility  traces  can  be  significantly  truncated  without  affecting  the  ability  of Sarsa(A)  to  find  optimal memoryless policies for POMDPs.",

Here, we investigate a model for the ac(cid:173) tivity dependent development of ocular dominance maps which allows  to vary the degree of lateral competition. For weak competition, it re(cid:173) sembles a correlation-based learning model and for strong competition,  it becomes a self-organizing map. Thus, in the regime of weak compe(cid:173) tition the receptive fields are shaped by the second order statistics of the  input patterns, whereas in the regime of strong competition, the higher  moments and \"features\" of the individual patterns become important.  When correlated localized stimuli from two eyes drive the cortical de(cid:173) velopment we find (i) that a topographic map and binocular, localized  receptive fields emerge when the degree of competition exceeds a critical  value and (ii) that receptive fields exhibit eye dominance beyond a sec(cid:173) ond critical value. For anti-correlated activity between the eyes, the sec(cid:173) ond order statistics drive the system to develop ocular dominance even  for weak competition, but no topography emerges. Topography is estab(cid:173) lished only beyond a critical degree of competition.",

Within the variational frame(cid:173) work for  approximating these models, we  present two classes of dis(cid:173) tributions,  decimatable  Boltzmann  Machines  and Tractable  Belief  Networks  that  go  beyond  the  standard  factorized  approach.

The  ICA  mixture  model  assumes  that  the  observed  data can  be  categorized  into  several  mutually  exclusive  data classes  in  which  the components  in each  class  are generated  by  a  linear  mixture  of independent  sources.  The  algorithm  finds  the independent sources, the mixing matrix for  each class and also  computes  the  class  membership  probability  for  each  data  point.  This  approach  extends  the  Gaussian  mixture  model  so  that  the  classes  can  have  non-Gaussian  structure.  We  demonstrate  that  this method can learn efficient codes to represent images of natural  scenes and text.  The learned classes of basis functions yield a better  approximation of the underlying distributions of the data, and thus  can provide greater coding efficiency.  We  believe that this method  is  well  suited to  modeling structure in  high-dimensional  data and  has many potential applications.",

        "abstract": "Visually-guided  arm  reaching  movements  are  produced  by  distributed  neural networks within parietal and frontal regions of the cerebral cortex.  Experimental  data  indicate  that (I) single  neurons  in  these  regions  are  broadly tuned to parameters of movement; (2) appropriate commands are  elaborated by  populations of neurons; (3) the coordinated action of neu(cid:173) rons can be  visualized  using a neuronal population vector (NPV).  How(cid:173) ever,  the  NPV  provides only  a rough  estimate  of movement parameters  (direction, velocity) and may even fail  to reflect the parameters of move(cid:173) ment when arm posture is changed.  We designed a model of the cortical  motor command to  investigate the relation between the desired direction  of the  movement, the  actual direction of movement and  the direction of  the NPV in  motor cortex. The model is a two-layer self-organizing neural  network  which  combines  broadly-tuned  (muscular)  proprioceptive  and  (cartesian) visual information to calculate (angular) motor commands for  the  initial  part  of the  movement of a  two-link  arm.  The  network  was  trained  by  motor babbling  in  5  positions.  Simulations  showed  that  (1)  the  network produced appropriate movement direction over a  large part  of the  workspace;  (2) small  deviations of the  actual  trajectory  from  the  desired  trajectory existed  at the extremities of the  workspace;  (3)  these  deviations were accompanied by  large deviations of the NPV from both  trajectories. These results suggest the NPV does not give a faithful image  of cortical processing during arm reaching movements.",
