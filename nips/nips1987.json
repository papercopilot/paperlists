Using  a  simple  Hebb-type  learning  rule  in  conjunc(cid:173) tion  with  the  cortical  dynamics  which  emerge  from  the  anatomical  and  physiological  organiza(cid:173) tion  of  the  model,  the  simulations  are  capable  of establishing  cortical  representations  for  differ(cid:173) ent  input  patterns.  The  basis  of  these  representations  lies  in  the  interaction  of  sparsely  distribut(cid:173) ed,  highly  divergent/convergent  interconnections  between  modeled  neurons.  We  have  shown  that  different  representations  can  be  stored  with  minimal  interference.  and  that  following  learning  these  representations  are  resistant  to  input  degradation,  allowing  reconstruction  of  a  representa(cid:173) tion  following  only  a  partial  presentation  of  an  original  training  stimulus.  Further,  we  have  demonstrated  that  the  degree  of  overlap  of  cortical  representations  for  different  stimuli  can  also  be  modulated.  For  instance  similar  input  patterns  can  be  induced  to generate  distinct  cortical  representations  (discrimination).  while  dissimilar  inputs  can  be  induced  to  generate  overlapping  representations  (accommodation).  Both  features  are  presumably  important  in  classifying  olfacto(cid:173) ry stimuli.",

An input vector in the feature space is transformed into an internal  representation which is a codeword in the code space, and then error correction  decoded in this space to classify the input feature vector to its class. Two classes  of codes which give high performance are the Hadamard matrix code and the  maximal length sequence code. We show that the number of classes stored in an  N-neuron system is linear in N and significantly more than that obtainable by  using the Hopfield type memory as a classifier.",

In this paper we will discuss the implementation of a two dimensional heterodyne  adaptive filter construction into a computer simulation model. The features of this  simulation model include the ability to account for the experimentally observed  stimulus-tuned adaptive temporal behaviour of time constants in the fly visual  system. The simulation results obtained, clearly show that the application of such  an adaptive processing procedure delivers an improved imaging technique of  moving patterns in the high velocity range.",

The method allows the fully distributed representation of symbolic structures:  the roles  in  the structures, as well as the fillers  for  those roles, can be arbitrarily non-local.  Fully and  partially localized  special cases reduce to existing cases of connectionist representations of structured  data;  the  tensor  product  representation  generalizes  these  and  the  few  existing  examples  of  fuUy  distributed  representations  of structures.  The  representation  saturates  gracefully  as  larger  structures  are  represented;  it penn its  recursive  construction  of complex  representations  from  simpler  ones;  it  respects  the  independence  of the  capacities  to generate and  maintain  multiple bindings in  parallel;  it  extends naturally to continuous structures and continuous representational patterns; it pennits values to  also  serve  as  variables;  it  enables  analysis  of  the  interference  of  symbolic  structures  stored  in  associative  memories;  and  it  leads  to characterization  of optimal  distributed representations  of roles  and a recirculation algorithm for learning them.",

Plotting  the  basins  for  fixed  points  (memories),  we  show  that  overloading  an  associative  memory  network  leads  to  irregular  basin  shapes.  The  network  also  includes  analog  time  delay  circuitry,  and  we  have  shown  that  delay  in  symmetric  networks  can  introduce  basins  for  oscillatory  attractors.

Optimizations using energy methods yield \"forces\" which  act upon  the  state of the  neural  network.  The penalty method, in which quadratic  energy  constraints  are  added  to  an  existing  optimization  energy,  has  become  popular  recently,  but  is  not  guaranteed  to satisfy  the  constraint conditions  when  there  are  other forces  on  the  neural  model  or when  there  are  multiple constraints.  In this paper, we present the basic differential multiplier method (BDMM),  which  satisfies constraints exactly;  we  create forces  which gradually apply  the constraints over time,  using \"neurons\" that estimate Lagrange multipliers.",

In  these  cells,  excitatory  postsynaptic  potentials  (EPSPs)  produce  cross(cid:173) correlogram peaks  which resemble  in large part the derivative of  the EPSP.  Additional  synaptic  noise broadens  the peak,  but the  peak  area  -- i.e.,  the  number of above-chance firings triggered per EPSP -- remains proportional to  the EPSP  amplitude.  A typical EPSP of 100  ~v triggers about .01  firings per  EPSP.  The  consequences  of  these  data  for  information  processing  by  polysynaptic connections is discussed.  The effects of sequential polysynaptic  links  can  be  calculated  by  convolving  the  effects  of  the  underlying  monosynaptic connections.

        "abstract": "There is  presently great interest in the abilities of neural networks to mimic \n\"qualitative reasoning\"  by manipulating neural incodings of symbols.  Less work \nhas  been performed on using neural networks to process floating  point numbers \nand it is  sometimes stated that neural networks are somehow inherently inaccu(cid:173)\nrate  and  therefore  best  suited  for  \"fuzzy\"  qualitative reasoning.  Nevertheless, \nthe  potential  speed  of massively  parallel  operations  make  neural  net  \"number \ncrunching\"  an interesting topic  to explore.  In this paper we  discuss some of our \nwork in which we  demonstrate that for  certain applications neural networks can \nachieve  significantly  higher  numerical  accuracy  than  more  conventional  tech(cid:173)\nniques.  In  particular,  prediction  of future  values  of a  chaotic  time  series  can \nbe  performed  with  exceptionally  high  accuracy.  We  analyze  how  a  neural  net \nis  able  to do  this  ,  and in  the process  show  that  a  large class  of functions  from \nRn.  ~ Rffl  may  be  accurately  approximated  by  a  backpropagation  neural  net \nwith just two  \"hidden\"  layers.  The network  uses  this functional  approximation \nto perform either interpolation (signal processing applications)  or extrapolation \n(symbol processing applicationsJ.  Neural nets therefore use quite familiar meth(cid:173)\nods to perform. their tasks.  The geometrical viewpoint advocated here seems to \nbe a  useful  approach  to analyzing  neural  network  operation  and  relates  neural \nnetworks  to well  studied topics  in  functional  approximation.",

        "abstract": "A lightness algorithm that separates surface reflectance from illumination in a  Mondrian world is synthesized automatically from a set of examples, pairs of input  (image irradiance) and desired output (surface reflectance). The algorithm, which re(cid:173) sembles a new lightness algorithm recently proposed by Land, is approximately equiva(cid:173) lent to filtering the image through a center-surround receptive field in individual chro(cid:173) matic channels. The synthesizing technique, optimal linear estimation, requires only  one assumption, that the operator that transforms input into output is linear. This  assumption is true for a certain class of early vision algorithms that may therefore be  synthesized in a similar way from examples. Other methods of synthesizing algorithms  from examples, or \"learning\", such as backpropagation, do not yield a significantly dif(cid:173) ferent or better lightness algorithm in the Mondrian world. The linear estimation and  backpropagation techniques both produce simultaneous brightness contrast effects.",

By moving its arm through a small, representative  sample of the 1 billion possible joint configurations, MURPHY learns the relationships,  backwards and forwards, between the positions of its joints and the state of its visual field.  MURPHY can use its internal model in the forward direction to \"envision\" sequences  of actions for planning purposes, such as in grabbing a visually presented object, or in  the reverse direction to \"imitate\", with its arm, autonomous activity in its visual field.  Furthermore, by taking explicit advantage of continuity in the mappings between visual  space and joint space, MURPHY is able to learn non-linear mappings with only a single  layer of modifiable weights.",

A  number  of adaptive  neuronal  models  have  been  proposed  in  the  literature.  Three specific models will be analyzed in this paper, specifically the  Hebb model, the Sutton-Barto model, and the most recent trace model.  In this  paper we  will  examine  the conditions  for  convergence,  the  position  of conver(cid:173) gence and the rate at convergence,  of these models  as they applied to classical  conditioning.

        "abstract": "Abstract.  Previous  work on  nets  with  continuous-valued inputs  led  to generative \nprocedures  to construct convex decision  regions with two-layer perceptrons (one hidden \nlayer) and  arbitrary decision  regions  with  three-layer perceptrons  (two hidden layers). \nHere we demonstrate that two-layer perceptron classifiers trained with back propagation \ncan  form  both  convex  and  disjoint  decision  regions.  Such  classifiers  are  robust,  train \nrapidly,  and  provide  good  performance  with  simple  decision  regions.  When  complex \ndecision  regions  are  required,  however,  convergence  time  can  be  excessively  long  and \nperformance is  often no better than that of k-nearest  neighbor classifiers.  Three neural \nnet  classifiers  are  presented  that  provide  more  rapid  training  under  such  situations. \nTwo use  fixed  weights in  the  first  one  or  two layers and  are  similar  to classifiers  that \nestimate probability density functions using histograms.  A third \"feature map classifier\" \nuses  both  unsupervised  and  supervised  training.  It provides  good  performance  with \nlittle supervised training in situations such as speech recognition where much unlabeled \ntraining data is  available.  The architecture of this classifier can  be  used  to implement \na  neural net  k-nearest  neighbor classifier.",

        "abstract": "This  paper deals  with a  neural network model in  which each neuron  performs a  threshold logic function.  An important property of the model  is  that  it always  converges  to a  stable state  when  operating in  a  serial  mode [2,5].  This property is  the basis of the potential applications of the  model such as associative memory devices and combinatorial optimization  [3,6].  One of the motivations for use of the model for solving hard combinatorial  problems  is  the fact  that it can  be implemented  by optical devices  and  thus operate at a  higher speed  than conventional electronics.  The main theme in this work is  to investigate the power of the model for  solving NP-hard problems  [4,8],  and to understand  the relation  between  speed of operation and the size of a  neural network.  In particular, it will  be  shown  that  for  any  NP-hard  problem  the  existence  of a  polynomial  size  network  that  solves  it  implies  that  NP=co-NP.  Also,  for  Traveling  Salesman  Problem  (TSP), even  a  polynomial  size  network  that  gets  an  \u20ac-approximate  solution does  not exist unless  P=NP.",

        "abstract": "Being able  to record the electrical activities of a  number of neurons simultaneously is  likely  to be important in  the study of the functional organization of networks of real neurons.  Using  one  extracellular  microelectrode  to  record  from  several neurons  is  one  approach  to  studying  the  response  properties  of sets  of  adjacent  and  therefore  likely  related  neurons.  However,  to  do  this,  it  is  necessary  to  correctly  classify  the  signals  generated  by  these  different  neurons.  This paper considers  this problem of classifying the  signals  in  such an  extracellular recording,  based upon their shapes, and specifically considers the classification of signals in the case when  spikes overlap  temporally.",

Given  that  the  network  never saturates  (ceases  to  function  effectively  due  to  an  overload  of  information),  the  learning  updates  can  con(cid:173) tinue indefinitely.  For these networks,  we  need  to introduce  performance  measmes in  addi(cid:173) tion  to  the  information  capacity  to  evaluate  the  different  networks.  We  mathematically  define  quantities such  as  the  plasticity  of  a  network,  the  efficacy  of an  information  vector,  and the  probability  of network  saturation.  From  these  quantities  we  analytically  compare  different networks.",

The  matrix  chip  contains  a  programmable  32X32  array  of  \"long  channel\"  NMOSFET  binary  connection  elements  imple(cid:173) mented  in  a  3-um  bulk  CMOS  process.

As  an  alternative  the  programmable  NMOSFET  (long  channel)  connection  elements,  tailored  thin  film  resistors  are  deposited,  in  series  with  FET  switches,  on  some  CMOS  test  chips,  to  obtain  the  weak  synaptic  connections.

The  performance  of  a  synaptic  chip  in  a  32- neuron  breadboard  system  in  an  associative  memory  test  application  is  discussed.",

        "abstract": "In the synchronous discrete model, the average memory capacity of  bidirectional associative memories (BAMs) is compared with that of  Hopfield memories, by means of a calculat10n of the percentage of good  recall for 100 random BAMs of dimension 64x64, for different numbers  of stored vectors. The memory capac1ty Is found to be much smal1er than  the Kosko upper bound, which Is the lesser of the two dimensions of the  BAM. On the average, a 64x64 BAM has about 68 % of the capacity of the  corresponding Hopfield memory with the same number of neurons. Ortho(cid:173) normal coding of the BAM Increases the effective storage capaCity by  only 25 %. The memory capacity limitations are due to spurious stable  states, which arise In BAMs In much the same way as in Hopfleld  memories. Occurrence of spurious stable states can be avoided by  replacing the thresholding in the backlayer of the BAM by another  nonl1near process, here called \"Dominant Label Selection\" (DLS). The  simplest DLS is the wlnner-take-all net, which gives a fault-sensitive  memory. Fault tolerance can be improved by the use of an orthogonal or  unitary transformation. An optical application of the latter is a Fourier  transform, which is implemented simply by a lens.",

        "abstract": "The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  explore  the  spatial  organization  of  neural  networks  under  Markovian  assumptions,  in  what  concerns  the be(cid:173) haviour  of  individual  cells  and  the  interconnection  mechanism.  Space(cid:173) organizational  properties  of  neural  nets  are  very  relevant  in  image  modeling  and  pattern  analysis,  where  spatial  computations  on  stocha(cid:173) stic  two-dimensional  image  fields  are  involved.  As  a  first  approach  we  develop  a  random  neural  network  model,  based  upon  simple  probabi(cid:173) listic  assumptions,  whose  organization  is  studied  by  means  of  dis(cid:173) crete-event  simulation.  We  then  investigate  the  possibility  of  ap(cid:173) proXimating  the  random  network's  behaviour  by  using  an  analytical  ap(cid:173) proach  originating  from  the  theory  of  general  product-form  queueing  networks.  The  neural  network  is  described  by  an  open  network  of  no(cid:173) des,  in  which  customers  moving  from  node  to  node  represent  stimula(cid:173) tions  and  connections  between  nodes  are  expressed  in  terms  of  sui(cid:173) tably  selected  routing  probabilities.  We  obtain  the  solution  of  the  model  under  different  disciplines  affecting  the  time  spent  by  a  sti(cid:173) mulation  at  each  node  visited.  Results  concerning  the  distribution  of  excitation  in  the  network  as  a  function  of  network  topology  and  external  stimulation  arrival  pattern  are  compared  with  measures  ob(cid:173) tained  from  the  simulation  and  validate  the  approach  followed.",

Our results  are  phrased in  terms of the  qualitative  properties of the individual neurons and in terms of the properties of the interconnecting  structure of the neural  networks.  Aspects of neural networks which  we  address include  asymptotic stability,  exponential stability,  and instability  of an  equilibrium;  estimates  of trajectory bounds; estimates of the domain of attraction of an asymptotically stable  equilibrium;  and stability of neural networks  under structural perturbations.",

This  type  of  communication contrasts with  that which  is  assumed  in most  other  models  which  typically  are  continuous  or  discrete  value-passing  networks.  Limiting the messages received  by each processing unit to  time  markers that signal  the firing  of other units  presents  significant  implemen tation advantages.",

Real neural networks exhibit significant locality,  yet most connectionist/neural network models have little. In this paper, the connectivity  requirements of a simple associative network are analyzed using communication theory.  Several techniques based on communication theory are presented that improve the robust(cid:173) ness of the network in the face of sparse, local interconnect structures. Also discussed are  some potential problems when information is distributed too widely.",

        "abstract": "An information-theoretic optimization principle is  proposed for  the development  of  each  processing  stage  of  a  multilayered  perceptual  network.  This  principle  of  \"maximum information preservation\"  states that the signal transformation that is to be  realized at each stage is one that maximizes the information that the output signal values  (from that stage) convey about the input signals values (to that stage), subject to certain  constraints and in  the presence of processing noise.  The quantity being maximized is  a  Shannon information rate.  I provide motivation for this principle and -- for some simple  model cases -- derive some of its consequences, discuss an algorithmic implementation,  and  show  how  the  principle  may  lead  to  biologically  relevant  neural  architectural  features  such  as  topographic  maps,  map  distortions,  orientation  selectivity,  and  extraction of spatial and temporal signal correlations.  A  possible  connection between  this  information-theoretic principle  and  a  principle  of minimum  entropy production in  nonequilibrium thermodynamics is suggested.",
