We  found  that local methods,  based on the  statistics of image patches, consistently outperformed global meth(cid:173) ods based on the statistics of entire images.  This result is consistent  with  previous  work  on  emotion  and facial  expression  recognition.  In  addition, the use of a stepwise regression technique for  selecting  variables and regions of interest substantially boosted performance.",

It  has  potential applications in  many areas  such  as  detection  of ma(cid:173) chine  damage  or  highlighting  abnormal features  in  medical data.  One  approach  is  to  build  a  hypothesis  estimating  the  support  of  the normal data i.e. constructing a function which is positive in the  region  where  the  data is  located  and  negative elsewhere.  Recently  kernel  methods  have  been  proposed  for  estimating the  support  of  a  distribution  and  they  have  performed well  in  practice - training  involves solution of a  quadratic programming problem.  In this pa(cid:173) per we propose a simpler kernel method for  estimating the support  based  on  linear  programming.  The  method  is  easy  to  implement  and  can learn large  datasets rapidly.

In the proposed approach one learns simultaneously (1) a distributed rep(cid:173) resentation for each word (i.e.  a similarity between words) along with (2)  the probability function for word sequences, expressed with these repre(cid:173) sentations.  Generalization is  obtained because a sequence of words that  has  never been seen before gets  high probability if it is  made of words  that are similar to words forming an already seen sentence.

The  result  is  obtained  in  a  PAC- Bayesian framework  and  is  based  on  geometrical  arguments  in  the space of linear  classifiers.  The  new  bound constitutes an exponential improvement of the so far tightest  margin bound by Shawe-Taylor et al.  [8]  and scales logarithmically  in  the inverse margin.  Even  in  the case  of less  training  examples  than input dimensions sufficiently large margins lead to non-trivial  bound values and - plexity  term.  Furthermore,  the  classical  margin  is  too  coarse  a  measure for  the  essential  quantity  that controls the generalisation  error:  the  volume  ratio  between  the  whole  hypothesis  space  and  the subset of consistent hypotheses.  The practical relevance of the  result  lies  in the fact  that the well-known support vector machine  is optimal w.r.t. the new bound only if the feature vectors are all of  the same length.  As a consequence we recommend to use SVMs on  normalised feature  vectors only - a  recommendation that is  well  supported  by our  numerical experiments on two  benchmark  data  sets.",

Data points are  mapped to  a high  dimensional  feature  space, where support vectors are used to define a sphere enclosing them.  The boundary of the sphere forms in data space a set of closed contours  containing the data.  Data points enclosed by each contour are defined as a  cluster. As the width parameter of the Gaussian kernel is decreased, these  contours fit  the data more tightly and  splitting of contours occurs.  The  algorithm  works  by  separating clusters  according  to  valleys  in  the un(cid:173) derlying probability distribution,  and  thus clusters can take on  arbitrary  geometrical shapes.  As in other SV algorithms, outliers can be dealt with  by introducing a soft margin constant leading to smoother cluster bound(cid:173) aries.  The  structure of the data is  explored by  varying the two parame(cid:173) ters.  We  investigate the dependence of our method on  these parameters  and apply it to several data sets.",

Our  method reduces  the  sizes  of the  intermediate value functions  generated  during value iteration by replacing the values at the terminals of the ADD  with  ranges  of values.  Our method is  demonstrated on  a class  of large  MDPs (with up to 34 billion states), and we compare the results with the  optimal value functions.",

In  virtually  all  of the  work  on  learning  these  networks,  the  assumption  is  that  we  are  presented  with  a data  set consisting  of randomly  generated instances  from  the  underlying  distribution.  In  many  situations, however, we  also  have  the  option  of active  learning, where  we  have  the  possibility of guiding the  sampling process by  querying  for certain types  of samples.  This  paper addresses the problem of estimating the parameters of Bayesian networks in  an  active  learning  setting.  We  provide  a  theoretical  framework  for  this  problem,  and  an  algorithm  that chooses  which  active  learning  queries  to  generate  based  on  the  model  learned  so  far.  We present experimental results showing that our active learning algorithm can significantly  reduce the need for training data in  many situations.",

Memory  modules  are  attached  to  sites  along  this  pathway.  Object-identity  decision  is  made  independently  at  each  site.  A  site's  response  time  is  a  monotonic-decreasing  function  of  its  confidence  regarding  its  decision.  An  observer's  response  is  the  first-arriving  response  from  any  site.

        "abstract": "We  present a novel way of obtaining PAC-style bounds on the gen(cid:173) eralization error of learning algorithms, explicitly using their stabil(cid:173) ity properties.  A stable learner is one for which the learned solution  does  not  change much with small  changes in the training set.  The  bounds we  obtain do not depend on any measure of the complexity  of the hypothesis space  (e.g.  VC  dimension)  but rather depend on  how  the  learning  algorithm  searches  this  space,  and  can  thus  be  applied  even when the VC  dimension is  infinite.  We  demonstrate  that regularization networks possess the required stability property  and apply our method to obtain new bounds on their generalization  performance.",

Maximizing this entropy with respect to  both the feed(cid:173) forward connections as well as the recurrent interactions results in simple  learning rules for both sets of parameters.

We propose a novel sample-based error measure for these classes of  models, which applies even in situations where maximum likelihood  (ML)  and  probability  density  estimation-based  formulations  can(cid:173) not be applied,  e.g.,  models that are nonlinear  or have intractable  posteriors.  Furthermore,  our  sample-based  error  measure  avoids  the difficulties of approximating a  density function.  We  prove that  with  an unconstrained  model,  (1)  our approach  converges  on  the  correct solution as the number of samples goes to infinity,  and  (2)  the expected solution of our approach in the generative framework  is  the  ML  solution.  Finally,  we  evaluate our approach via simula(cid:173) tions of linear and nonlinear models  on  mixture of Gaussians and  ICA problems.

This  color  opponency  has  been  shown  to  constitute  an  efficient encoding by spectral decorrelation of the receptor signals.  We analyze the spatial and chromatic structure of natural scenes by  decomposing the spectral images into a set of linear basis functions  such  that  they  constitute  a  representation  with  minimal  redun(cid:173) dancy.  Independent  component  analysis  finds  the  basis  functions  that  transforms  the  spatiochromatic  data  such  that  the  outputs  (activations)  are statistically as independent  as  possible,  i.e.  least  redundant.  The  resulting  basis functions  show  strong  opponency  along  an  achromatic  direction  (luminance  edges),  along  a  blue(cid:173) yellow  direction,  and along  a red-blue direction.  Furthermore, the  resulting activations have very sparse distributions, suggesting that  the use  of color  opponency in the human visual system achieves a  highly  efficient  representation of colors.  Our findings  suggest that  color opponency is a result of the properties of natural spectra and  not  solely  a  consequence of the overlapping cone spectral sensitiv(cid:173) ities.",

Applying the results to learning a  teacher defined by a two-layer network, I can  directly compare GP and  Bayesian NN learning. I find that a GP in general requires CJ (d S )-training  examples  to  learn  input features  of order  s  (d  is  the  input dimension),  whereas  a  NN  can  learn  the  task  with  order  the  number of adjustable  weights training examples.

For a linearly separable problem, it is known  that under appropriate assumptions, the expected misclassification error  of the computed \"optimal hyperplane\" approaches zero at a rate propor(cid:173) tional  to  the  inverse  training  sample  size.  This  rate  is  usually charac(cid:173) terized  by the margin and the maximum norm of the input data.  In  this  paper,  we  argue  that another quantity,  namely  the robustness of the  in(cid:173) put data distribution,  also  plays  an  important role  in characterizing  the  convergence behavior of expected misclassification error.  Based on  this  concept of robustness,  we  show that for a large margin  separable linear  classification problem, the expected misclassification error may converge  exponentially in the number of training sample size.",

Recordings  from  single  V 4  neurons  suggest  that  simultaneously  presented  stimuli  compete  to  set  the  output  firing  rate,  and  that  attention  acts  to  isolate  individual  features  by  biasing  the  competition in  favor  of the  attended  object.  We propose that both stimulus competition and attentional bias(cid:173) ing arise from the spatial segregation of afferent synapses onto different  regions of the excitable dendritic tree of V 4 neurons. The pattern of feed(cid:173) forward, stimulus-driven inputs follows from  a Hebbian rule:  excitatory  afferents  with  similar RFs  tend  to  group  together on  the  dendritic  tree,  avoiding randomly located inhibitory inputs with similar RFs.  The same  principle  guides  the  formation  of inputs  that  mediate  attentional  mod(cid:173) ulation.  Using  both  biophysically  detailed  compartmental  models  and  simplified models of computation in single neurons, we demonstrate that  such an architecture could account for the response properties and atten(cid:173) tional modulation of V 4 neurons.

        "abstract": "A serious problem in learning probabilistic models is the presence of hid(cid:173) den variables. These variables are not observed, yet interact with several  of the observed variables.  As  such,  they induce seemingly complex de(cid:173) pendencies  among  the  latter.  In  recent years,  much  attention  has  been  devoted to  the  development of algorithms for  learning parameters,  and  in  some cases  structure, in  the presence of hidden variables.  In this  pa(cid:173) per,  we  address  the  related  problem of detecting  hidden  variables  that  interact with the observed variables.  This problem is of interest both for  improving our understanding of the domain and as a preliminary step that  guides the learning procedure towards promising models.  A very natural  approach is  to  search for \"structural  signatures\" of hidden variables - substructures in the learned network that tend to  suggest the presence of  a hidden variable.  We  make this  basic  idea concrete, and  show  how  to  integrate it with structure-search algorithms.  We evaluate this method on  several synthetic and real-life datasets, and show that it performs surpris(cid:173) ingly well.",

In  the  psy(cid:173) chophysical experiments, we tested observers ability to discriminate  contrasts of peripheral  Gabor patches  in  the  presence  of collinear  Gabor flankers.  The data reveal a complex interaction pattern that  we  account  for  by  assuming  that  flankers  provide  divisive  inhibi(cid:173) tion  to  the  target  unit  for  low  target  contrasts,  but  provide  sub(cid:173) tractive  inhibition  to  the  target  unit  for  higher  target  contrasts.  A similar switch from divisive to subtractive inhibition is  observed  in  an integrate-and-fire unit that receives  inhibition  modulated in  time such that the cell spends part of the time in  a high-inhibition  state  and  part  of  the  time  in  a  low-inhibition  state.  The  simi(cid:173) larity  between  the effects  suggests  that  one  may  cause  the  other.  The biophysical model makes testable predictions for  physiological  single-cell  recordings.",

This is  an  extension to  an  efficient  form of covariance modelling used in  speech recognition, semi-tied co(cid:173) variance matrices.  In the standard form of semi-tied covariance matrices  the covariance matrix is  decomposed into a highly shared decorrelating  transform and a component-specific diagonal covariance matrix. The use  of a factored decorrelating transform is presented in this paper. This fac(cid:173) toring effectively increases the number of possible transforms without in(cid:173) creasing the number of free parameters. Maximum likelihood estimation  schemes for all the model parameters are presented including the compo(cid:173) nent/transform assignment,  transform and component parameters.  This  new  model  form  is  evaluated on  a large vocabulary  speech  recognition  task.  It is  shown that using this  factored  form of covariance modelling  reduces the word error rate.",

Most existing  approaches  assume that features  can be tracked across frames,  whereas methods that exploit rigidity  constraints to facilitate matching do so only under restricted  cam(cid:173) era  motion.  In  this  paper  we  propose  a  Bayesian  approach  that  avoids  the  brittleness  associated  with  singling out  one  \"best\"  cor(cid:173) respondence,  and instead consider the distribution over all possible  correspondences.  We  treat  both  a  fully  Bayesian  approach  that  yields  a  posterior  distribution,  and  a  MAP  approach  that  makes  use of EM  to maximize this posterior.  We show how  Markov chain  Monte  Carlo methods can  be  used  to implement these  techniques  in practice,  and present  experimental results on real  data.",

Neither the role of synaptic dynamics  itself nor the  role  of the  heterogeneity of synaptic  dynamics  for  com(cid:173) putations in neural circuits is  well  understood.  We present in this article  methods that make it feasible to compute for a given synapse with known  synaptic parameters the spike train that is optimally fitted  to the synapse,  for example in the  sense that it produces the largest sum of postsynap(cid:173) tic responses.  To  our surprise we find  that most of these optimally fitted  spike  trains  match  common firing  patterns  of specific  types  of neurons  that are discussed in the literature.",

Fine tuning of the chip's input parameters is done automatically by  the robotic system, using an unsupervised Support Vector (SV) learning  algorithm introduced  recently  [7].

Gaussianization is  motivated from  recent developments in  the statistics  literature:  projection pursuit, independent component analysis and Gaus(cid:173) sian  mixture  models  with  semi-tied  covariances.  We  propose  an  iter(cid:173) ative  Gaussianization  procedure  which  converges  weakly:  at  each  it(cid:173) eration,  the  data is  first  transformed  to  the  least dependent coordinates  and then each coordinate is  marginally Gaussianized by univariate tech(cid:173) niques.

Because the training examples in an ill-posed data set do not  fully span the signal space the observed training set variances in  each basis vector will be too high compared to the average vari(cid:173) ance of the test set projections onto the same basis vectors. On  basis of this understanding we introduce the Generalizable Singu(cid:173) lar Value Decomposition (GenSVD) as a means to reduce this bias  by re-estimation of the singular values obtained in a conventional  Singular Value Decomposition, allowing for a generalization perfor(cid:173) mance increase of a subsequent statistical model. We demonstrate  that the algorithm succesfully corrects bias in a data set from a  functional PET activation study of the human brain.",

        "abstract": "Belief propagation  (BP)  was  only  supposed  to  work  for  tree-like  networks but works surprisingly well in many applications involving  networks  with  loops,  including  turbo  codes.  However,  there  has  been  little  understanding  of  the  algorithm  or  the  nature  of  the  solutions it finds  for  general graphs.  We  show  that  BP  can  only  converge  to  a  stationary  point  of an  approximate free  energy,  known as the Bethe free  energy in statis(cid:173) tical physics.  This result  characterizes BP fixed-points  and makes  connections with variational approaches to approximate inference.  More importantly, our analysis lets us  build  on the progress made  in  statistical  physics  since  Bethe's  approximation was  introduced  in 1935.  Kikuchi and others have shown how to construct more ac(cid:173) curate free energy approximations, of which Bethe's approximation  is  the  simplest.  Exploiting  the  insights  from  our analysis,  we  de(cid:173) rive generalized belief propagation (GBP) versions ofthese Kikuchi  approximations.  These  new  message  passing  algorithms  can  be  significantly more accurate than ordinary BP, at an adjustable in(cid:173) crease in complexity.  We  illustrate such  a  new  GBP algorithm on  a grid Markov network and show that it gives much more accurate  marginal probabilities than those found  using ordinary BP.",

The  second scheme  adapts the synaptic \"threshold\" depending on the neuron's activity.  The  threshold is  lowered if the  neuron's activity  decreases over a long  time  and  is  increased  for  prolonged  increase  in  postsynaptic  activity.  Both  these  mechanisms  for  adaptation use  floating-gate  technology.  The re(cid:173) sults shown here are measured from  a chip fabricated in  a 2-J.lm  CMOS  process.",

Previous re(cid:173) search on output coding has employed, almost solely, predefined discrete  codes. We describe an algorithm that improves the performance of output  codes by relaxing them  to  continuous codes.  The relaxation procedure  is  cast  as  an  optimization  problem and  is  reminiscent of the  quadratic  program for support vector machines.  We describe experiments with the  proposed algorithm, comparing it to  standard discrete output codes.  The  experimental results indicate that continuous relaxations of output codes  often improve the generalization performance, especially for short codes.",

Automated analysis, even at a low(cid:173) level,  faces  severe challenges, including  the  lack of accurate  statistical  models  for  the  signals,  and  their high-dimensionality  and  varied  sam(cid:173) pling rates.  Previous approaches  [6]  assumed simple parametric models  for the joint distribution which, while tractable, cannot capture the com(cid:173) plex signal relationships. We learn the joint distribution of the visual and  auditory  signals using a non-parametric approach.  First,  we project the  data into  a maximally  informative,  low-dimensional subspace,  suitable  for density estimation.  We  then  model the  complicated stochastic rela(cid:173) tionships between the  signals  using  a nonparametric density  estimator.  These  learned densities  allow  processing across  signal  modalities.  We  demonstrate,  on  synthetic and  real  signals,  localization  in  video  of the  face that is  speaking in  audio, and,  conversely, audio enhancement of a  particular speaker selected from the video.",

The  wavelet  basis,  which  may  be  either  complete  or  overcomplete,  is  specified  by  a  small number of spatial functions  which  are  repeated across space  and combined in a  recursive fashion  so  as  to be self-similar across  scale.  These functions are adapted to minimize the estimated code  length under a model that assumes images are composed of a linear  superposition of sparse,  independent  components.  When  adapted  to natural images, the wavelet  bases take on  different  orientations  and they evenly tile the orientation domain, in stark contrast to the  standard,  non-oriented  wavelet  bases  used  in  image  compression.  When  the  basis  set  is  allowed  to  be  overcomplete,  it  also  yields  higher coding efficiency than standard wavelet  bases.",

Effective models  of human dynamics  can be learned from motion capture data using switching linear dynamic  system  (SLDS)  models.  We  present results  for human  motion  synthe(cid:173) sis, classification, and visual tracking using learned SLDS models.  Since  exact inference in SLDS is intractable, we present three approximate in(cid:173) ference algorithms and compare their performance.  In particular, a new  variational  inference algorithm  is  obtained by  casting the  SLDS  model  as  a Dynamic  Bayesian  Network.  Classification experiments  show  the  superiority of SLDS over conventional HMM's for our problem domain.",

        "abstract": "It has long been known that lateral inhibition in neural networks can lead  to a winner-take-all competition, so that only a single neuron is active at  a steady  state.  Here we  show how  to  organize lateral inhibition so that  groups  of neurons  compete to  be  active.  Given  a  collection  of poten(cid:173) tially overlapping groups, the inhibitory connectivity is  set by a formula  that can be interpreted as arising from a simple learning rule.  Our analy(cid:173) sis demonstrates that such inhibition generally results in  winner-take-all  competition between  the  given  groups,  with  the exception of some de(cid:173) generate cases.  In a broader context, the network serves  as  a particular  illustration  of the  general  distinction  between  permitted  and  forbidden  sets,  which was introduced recently.  From this  viewpoint, the computa(cid:173) tional function  of our network is  to  store and retrieve memories as  per(cid:173) mitted sets of coactive neurons.",

Here  we  concentrate  on  video  sprites,  which  are  a  special  type  of  video  texture.  In  video  sprites,  instead of storing whole  images,  the  object  of inter(cid:173) est  is  separated  from  the  background  and  the  video  samples  are  stored as  a sequence of alpha-matted sprites with associated veloc(cid:173) ity information.  They can be  rendered anywhere  on the screen to  create a novel animation of the object.  We present methods to cre(cid:173) ate  such  animations  by  finding  a  sequence  of sprite  samples  that  is  both  visually  smooth  and  follows  a  desired  path.  To  estimate  visual  smoothness,  we  train  a  linear  classifier  to  estimate  visual  similarity  between video  samples.  If the  motion  path is  known in  advance,  we  use  beam search to find  a  good sample sequence.

        "abstract": "We present a computational model of the neural mechanisms in the pari(cid:173) etal and  temporal lobes that support spatial navigation, recall of scenes  and  imagery  of the  products  of recall.  Long  term  representations  are  stored  in  the  hippocampus,  and  are  associated  with  local  spatial  and  object-related features  in the parahippocampal region.  Viewer-centered  representations are dynamically generated from long term memory in the  parietal part of the  model.  The model thereby  simulates recall  and  im(cid:173) agery  of locations and  objects in  complex environments.  After parietal  damage,  the  model exhibits hemispatial neglect in  mental imagery that  rotates  with  the  imagined perspective of the  observer,  as  in  the  famous  Milan  Square experiment  [1].  Our model  makes  novel  predictions for  the  neural representations  in  the  parahippocampal and  parietal  regions  and for behavior in healthy volunteers and neuropsychological patients.",

The  responses  of such  filters  exhibit a striking form of statistical dependency, in  which the  response  variance of each filter grows with the response amplitude of filters tuned  for  nearby  frequencies.  These  dependencies  may  be  substantially  re(cid:173) duced  using  an  operation  known  as  divisive  normalization,  in  which  the  response  of each  filter  is  divided  by  a  weighted  sum  of the  recti(cid:173) fied responses of other filters.  The weights may  be chosen to  maximize  the independence of the normalized responses for  an ensemble of natu(cid:173) ral  sounds.  We  demonstrate that the resulting model  accounts for  non(cid:173) linearities in the response characteristics of the auditory nerve, by com(cid:173) paring model simulations to electrophysiological recordings. In previous  work  (NIPS,  1998)  we  demonstrated  that  an  analogous  model derived  from the statistics of natural images accounts for non-linear properties of  neurons in primary visual cortex.  Thus, divisive normalization appears to  be a generic mechanism for eliminating a type of statistical dependency  that is prevalent in natural signals of different modalities.",

These approaches extend the standard hidden Markov model  (HMM)  based approach by assuming that the different (frequency)  channels representing the speech signal are processed by different  (independent)  \"experts\", each expert focusing  on a  different  char(cid:173) acteristic of the signal, and that the different stream likelihoods (or  posteriors) are combined at some (temporal) stage to yield a global  recognition output.  As  a further  extension to multi-stream ASR,  we  will  finally  introduce  a  new  approach,  referred  to  as  HMM2,  where the HMM  emission probabilities are estimated via state spe(cid:173) cific feature based HMMs responsible for merging the stream infor(cid:173) mation and modeling their possible correlation.",

Its applications therein include the EM  algorithm, Bayesian estimation and Bayesian inference. Jensen com(cid:173) putes simple lower bounds on otherwise intractable quantities such as  products of sums and latent log-likelihoods. This simplification then per(cid:173) mits operations like integration and maximization. Quite often (i.e. in  discriminative learning) upper bounds are needed as well. We derive and  prove an efficient analytic inequality that provides such variational upper  bounds. This inequality holds for latent variable mixtures of exponential  family distributions and thus spans a wide range of contemporary statis(cid:173) tical models. We also discuss applications of the upper bounds including  maximum conditional likelihood, large margin discriminative models and  conditional Bayesian inference. Convergence, efficiency and prediction  results are shown. 1",

We  show  that  nets  with  excess  capacity  generalize  well when  trained with backprop and early  stopping.  Experiments  sug(cid:173) gest two reasons for this:  1) Overfitting can vary significantly in different  regions of the model.  Excess capacity allows better fit to regions of high  non-linearity,  and  backprop often  avoids  overfitting  the  regions  of low  non-linearity.  2)  Regardless  of size,  nets  learn  task  subcomponents  in  similar sequence.  Big nets pass  through stages  similar to those learned  by  smaller nets.  Early  stopping can  stop training the large net  when  it  generalizes  comparably  to  a  smaller net.  We  also  show  that conjugate  gradient can yield worse generalization because it overfits regions of low  non-linearity when learning to fit regions of high non-linearity.",

We  study symmet(cid:173) ric  threshold-linear  networks  and  derive  stability  results  that  go  beyond the insights that  can  be  gained  from  Lyapunov theory or  energy functions.  By applying linear analysis to subnetworks com(cid:173) posed of coactive  neurons,  we  determine the  stability of potential  steady states.  We find that stability depends on two types of eigen(cid:173) modes.  One  type  determines  global  stability  and  the  other  type  determines whether or not multistability is possible.  We  can prove  the  equivalence  of  our  stability  criteria  with  criteria  taken  from  quadratic  programming.  Also,  we  show  that  there  are  permitted  sets  of neurons that  can be coactive at  a  steady state and forbid(cid:173) den sets that cannot.  Permitted sets are clustered in the sense that  subsets of permitted sets are permitted and supersets of forbidden  sets  are forbidden.  By  viewing  permitted sets as memories  stored  in the synaptic connections,  we  can provide a formulation of long(cid:173) term memory that is more general than the traditional perspective  of fixed  point attractor networks.",

Biological synapses are dynamic, i.e., their \"weight\" changes on  a short  time  scale  by  several  hundred percent in  dependence of the  past  input  to  the  synapse.  In  this  article  we  explore  the  consequences  that  these  synaptic  dynamics  entail  for  the  computational  power  of feedforward  neural  networks. We  show that gradient descent suffices to  approximate  a given  (quadratic) filter  by  a rather small  neural  system  with  dynamic  synapses.  We  also  compare our network model to  artificial  neural net(cid:173) works  designed  for  time  series  processing.  Our  numerical  results  are  complemented by  theoretical analysis which  show  that even with just a  single hidden layer such networks can approximate a surprisingly large  large  class  of nonlinear filters:  all  filters  that  can  be  characterized  by  Volterra series. This result is robust with regard to various changes in the  model for synaptic dynamics.",

Individuals are then recognized by  finding  the highest  relative probability pair among all pairs that consist of a test image and  an image whose identity is known.  Our method compares favorably with  other methods in the literature. The generative model consists of a single  layer of rate-coded, non-linear feature detectors  and  it has  the property  that,  given a data vector,  the  true posterior probability distribution  over  the feature detector activities can be inferred rapidly without iteration or  approximation. The weights of the feature detectors are learned by com(cid:173) paring the correlations of pixel intensities and feature activations in two  phases: When the network is observing real data and when it is observing  reconstructions of real data generated from the feature activations.",

        "abstract": "The  product  of  experts  learning  procedure  [1]  can  discover  a  set  of  stochastic binary features that constitute a non-linear generative model of  handwritten images of digits.  The quality of generative models learned  in this way can be assessed by learning a separate model for each class of  digit and  then comparing the unnormalized probabilities of test images  under the  10 different class-specific models.  To  improve discriminative  performance, it is helpful to learn a hierarchy of separate models for each  digit class.  Each model in the hierarchy has one layer of hidden units and  the nth level model is trained on data that consists of the activities of the  hidden  units  in  the  already  trained  (n  - l)th  level  model.  After train(cid:173) ing, each level produces a separate, unnormalized log probabilty score.  With a three-level hierarchy for each of the 10 digit classes, a test image  produces 30 scores  which  can  be used  as  inputs to  a supervised,  logis(cid:173) tic classification network that is trained on separate data.  On the MNIST  database, our system is comparable with current state-of-the-art discrimi(cid:173) native methods, demonstrating that the product of experts learning proce(cid:173) dure can produce effective generative models of high-dimensional data.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a  new  reinforcement  learning  (RL)  paradigm  that explicitly takes into account input disturbance as well as mod(cid:173) eling errors.  The use of environmental models  in  RL  is  quite pop(cid:173) ular  for  both  off-line  learning  by  simulations  and  for  on-line  ac(cid:173) tion planning.  However, the difference between the model and the  real environment can lead to unpredictable, often unwanted results.  Based on the theory of H oocontrol, we consider a  differential game  in  which  a  'disturbing'  agent  (disturber)  tries  to  make  the  worst  possible  disturbance  while  a  'control'  agent  (actor)  tries  to  make  the best control input.  The problem is formulated as finding a min(cid:173) max solution of a  value function that takes into account the norm  of the output deviation and the norm of the disturbance.  We derive  on-line  learning  algorithms  for  estimating  the  value  function  and  for  calculating the worst disturbance and the best  control in refer(cid:173) ence to the value function.  We  tested the paradigm, which we call  \"Robust  Reinforcement  Learning  (RRL),\"  in  the task  of inverted  pendulum.  In  the  linear  domain,  the  policy  and  the  value  func(cid:173) tion learned by the on-line algorithms coincided with those derived  analytically  by the linear  H ootheory.  For a  fully  nonlinear  swing(cid:173) up task, the control by RRL  achieved  robust  performance against  changes in the pendulum weight  and friction  while a  standard RL  control could not  deal with such environmental changes.",

        "abstract": "An  important  class  of problems  can  be  cast  as inference  in noisy(cid:173) OR Bayesian networks,  where  the binary state of each variable is  a  logical  OR of noisy  versions  of the  states of the  variable's  par(cid:173) ents.  For example, in medical diagnosis, the presence of a symptom  can be expressed as a noisy-OR of the diseases that may cause the  symptom  - on  some  occasions,  a  disease  may fail  to  activate  the  symptom.  Inference  in  richly-connected noisy-OR networks is  in(cid:173) tractable,  but  approximate methods  (e .g.,  variational techniques)  are  showing  increasing  promise  as  practical  solutions.  One  prob(cid:173) lem  with  most  approximations  is  that  they  tend  to  concentrate  on  a  relatively  small  number  of  modes  in  the  true  posterior,  ig(cid:173) noring  other plausible  configurations of the  hidden  variables.  We  introduce a  new  sequential variational method for  bipartite noisy(cid:173) OR networks, that favors  including  all modes of the true posterior  and models the  posterior distribution  as  a  tree.  We  compare this  method with other approximations using an ensemble of networks  with network statistics that are comparable to the QMR-DT med(cid:173) ical diagnostic network.",

        "abstract": "We  develop  an  approach  to  object  recognition  based  on  match(cid:173) ing shapes and using a resulting measure of similarity in a  nearest  neighbor  classifier.  The  key  algorithmic  problem  here  is  that  of  finding  pointwise  correspondences  between  an  image shape  and  a  stored  prototype  shape.  We  introduce  a  new  shape  descriptor,  the  shape  context,  which  makes  this  possible,  using  a  simple  and  robust algorithm.  The shape context at a point captures the distri(cid:173) bution over relative positions of other shape points and thus sum(cid:173) marizes  global  shape in  a  rich,  local  descriptor.  We  demonstrate  that  shape  contexts  greatly  simplify  recovery  of correspondences  between points of two given shapes.  Once shapes are aligned, shape  contexts are used to define a robust score for measuring shape sim(cid:173) ilarity.  We  have  used  this  score  in  a  nearest-neighbor  classifier  for  recognition of hand written  digits  as  well  as  3D  objects,  using  exactly  the  same  distance  function.  On  the  benchmark  MNIST  dataset  of handwritten  digits,  this  yields  an  error  rate  of 0.63%,  outperforming other published techniques.",

Un(cid:173) fortunately,  the  technique  is  not  'sparse',  since  the  components  thus obtained are expressed in terms of kernels associated with ev(cid:173) ery training vector.  This paper shows  that by  approximating the  covariance matrix in  feature  space by a  reduced  number of exam(cid:173) ple vectors, using a  maximum-likelihood approach, we may obtain  a highly sparse form  of kernel PCA without loss of effectiveness.",

The framework transforms the denois(cid:173) ing and dereverberation problems into Bayes-optimal signal estimation.  The  key  idea is  to  use  a  strong  speech  model  that  is  pre-trained on  a  large data set of clean speech.  Computational efficiency is  achieved by  using variational EM, working in  the frequency domain, and employing  conjugate priors.  The framework covers both single and multiple micro(cid:173) phones.  We  apply this  approach to noisy reverberant speech signals and  get results substantially better than standard methods.",

The resulting synaptic ma(cid:173) trices have an outer-product form in which the oscillating patterns  are  represented  as  complex  vectors.

This paper  derives a temporally dependent learning rule from the basic princi(cid:173) ple of mutual information maximization and studies its relation to  the experimentally observed  plasticity.  We  find  that  a  supervised  spike-dependent learning rule sharing similar structure with the ex(cid:173) perimentally observed plasticity increases mutual information to a  stable near  optimal  level.  Moreover,  the  analysis  reveals  how  the  temporal structure of time-dependent learning rules is  determined  by the temporal filter  applied by neurons over their inputs.

A  direct  compu(cid:173) tation of this feature vector  would involve a  prohibitive amount of  computation  even  for  modest  values  of k,  since  the  dimension  of  the feature space grows exponentially with k.  The paper describes  how despite this fact the inner product can be efficiently evaluated  by a dynamic programming technique.

Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in AoA. While  some studies have shown that frequency has no effect when AoA is con(cid:173) trolled for,  more recent studies have found independent contributions of  frequency and AoA. Connectionist models have repeatedly shown strong  effects  of frequency,  but  little  attention  has  been  paid  to  whether they  can also  show  AoA effects.  Indeed,  several researchers have explicitly  claimed  that they  cannot  show  AoA  effects.  In  this  work,  we  explore  these claims using a simple feed forward neural network.  We find  a sig(cid:173) nificant  contribution  of AoA  to  naming  latency,  as  well  as  conditions  under which frequency provides an independent contribution.",

We  describe  a connectionist constraint satisfaction  model  of  how  people  solve  anagram problems.  The  model exploits  statistics  of  English  orthography,  but  also  addresses  the  interplay  of  sub symbolic  and  symbolic  computation  by  a  mechanism  that  extracts  approximate  symbolic representations (partial orderings of letters) from sub symbolic  structures  and  injects  the  extracted  representation back into  the  model  to  assist  in  the  solution  of the  anagram.  We  show  the  computational  benefit of this extraction-injection process and discuss its relationship to  conscious mental processes and  working memory.  We  also  account for  experimental data concerning the difficulty of anagram solution based on  the orthographic structure of the anagram string and the target word.",

The KGS  can be used  as  an analytical tool for  the exploration of  Bayesian transduction, Bayes point machines,  active learning, and  evidence-based model selection on small data sets that are contam(cid:173) inated with  label noise.  For a  simple toy example  we  demonstrate  experimentally how  a Bayes point machine based on the KGS  out(cid:173) performs  an  SVM  that  is  incapable  of  taking  into  account  label  noise.",

This  is  done  by  identifying  a  class  of kernels  which  can  be  represented  as  norm-based distances in Hilbert spaces.  It turns out that common kernel  algorithms,  such as  SVMs and kernel PCA,  are actually really distance  based algorithms and can be run with that class of kernels, too.  As  well  as  providing  a  useful  new  insight  into  how  these  algorithms  work, the present work can form the basis for conceiving new algorithms.",

In this paper we  explore the general applicability  of this  assumption  and show  that,  surprisingly,  it holds  in a  large  variety of less structured environments including rural scenes.  This  enables us, from  a single image, to determine the orientation of the  viewer relative to the scene structure and also to detect target ob(cid:173) jects  which  are  not  aligned  with  the  grid.  These  inferences  are  performed  using  a  Bayesian  model  with  probability  distributions  (e.g.  on the image gradient statistics)  learnt from  real data.",

One clear  question  is whether the same coding rules are used  by  different  neurons, or  by  corresponding  neurons  in  different  individuals.  We  present  a  quantitative formulation of this problem using ideas from  informa(cid:173) tion theory, and apply this approach to the analysis of experiments  in the fly  visual  system.  We  find  significant  individual  differences  in  the  structure of the  code,  particularly  in  the  way  that tempo(cid:173) ral  patterns of spikes  are  used  to  convey information  beyond that  available from  variations in spike  rate.  On the other hand,  all  the  flies  in our ensemble exhibit  a  high coding efficiency,  so  that every  spike carries the same amount of information in all the individuals.

The Q-value of a state-action pair is approximated  by the free energy of a product of experts network.  Network parameters  are learned on-line using a modified SARSA algorithm which minimizes  the inconsistency of the Q-values of consecutive state-action pairs.  Ac(cid:173) tions are chosen based on the current value estimates by fixing the current  state and sampling actions from the network using Gibbs sampling. The  algorithm is  tested  on  a co-operative multi-agent task.

We  present an algorithm that produces a  linear  classifier that is guaranteed to achieve an error better than random  guessing for  any distribution on the data.  While this weak  learner  is not useful for  learning in general, we show that under reasonable  conditions on the distribution it yields an effective weak learner for  one-dimensional  problems.  Preliminary  simulations  suggest  that  similar  behavior  can  be  expected  in  higher  dimensions,  a  result  which  is  corroborated by  some  recent  theoretical  bounds.  Addi(cid:173) tionally, we  provide improved convergence rate bounds for the gen(cid:173) eralization error in situations where the empirical error can be made  small,  which  is  exactly the  situation  that  occurs  if weak  learners  with guaranteed performance that is better than random guessing  can be established.",

        "abstract": "It has been shown that the receptive fields of simple cells in VI can be ex(cid:173) plained by assuming optimal encoding, provided that an extra constraint  of sparseness  is  added.  This  finding  suggests that there is  a reason, in(cid:173) dependent of optimal representation, for sparseness.  However this work  used  an  ad  hoc  model for the  noise.  Here I show that,  if a biologically  more plausible noise model, describing neurons as  Poisson processes, is  used  sparseness does  not have to  be  added as  a constraint.  Thus I con(cid:173) clude that sparseness is not a feature that evolution has striven for,  but is  simply the result of the evolutionary pressure towards an  optimal repre(cid:173) sentation.",

The algorithm identifies the  neurons or areas which participate in a cognitive or behavioral task, given  data about performance decrease in a small set of lesions.  It also allows  the  accurate  prediction  of performances  due  to  multi-element  lesions.  The effectiveness  of the  new  algorithm is  demonstrated  in  two  models  of recurrent neural  networks with  complex interactions among  the ele(cid:173) ments.  The algorithm is  scalable and applicable to  the  analysis of large  neural  networks.  Given  the  recent advances  in  reversible  inactivation  techniques,  it has  the  potential  to  significantly  contribute  to  the  under(cid:173) standing of the  organization of biological nervous systems, and to  shed  light on  the  long-lasting debate about local  versus distributed computa(cid:173) tion in the brain.",

        "abstract": "We  present  efficient  algorithms for  all-point-pairs  problems ,  or  'N(cid:173) body '-like problems, which  are  ubiquitous in statistical learning.  We  focus on six examples, including nearest-neighbor classification, kernel  density  estimation,  outlier  detection ,  and  the  two-point  correlation.  These include any problem which abstractly requires  a comparison of  each  of the  N  points  in  a  dataset  with  each  other  point  and  would  naively  be  solved  using  N 2  distance  computations.  In  practice  N  is  often  large  enough  to  make this  infeasible.  We  present  a  suite  of  new  geometric  t echniques  which  are  applicable  in  principle  to  any  'N-body'  computation  including  large-scale  mixtures  of  Gaussians,  RBF neural networks,  and HMM 's.  Our  algorithms exhibit favorable  asymptotic  scaling  and  are  empirically  several  orders  of magnitude  faster  than  the  naive  computation,  even  for  small datasets.  We  are  aware of no exact  algorithms for  these  problems which  are  more effi(cid:173) cient  either  empirically  or  theoretically.  In  addition,  our framework  yields  simple and  elegant  algorithms.  It also  permits two  important  generalizations  beyond  the  standard  all-point-pairs  problems,  which  are  more difficult.  These  are  represented  by  our final  examples,  the  multiple two-point correlation  and the  notorious n-point correlation.",
