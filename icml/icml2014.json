In particular we address the following open problem: \\emphIs it possible to design computationally efficient differentially private risk minimizers with  excess risk bounds that do not explicitly depend on dimensionality (p) and do not require  structural assumptions like restricted strong convexity?  In this paper, we answer the question in the affirmative for a variant of the well-known  \\emphoutput and \\emphobjective perturbation algorithms [Chaudhuri et al., 2011]. In particular, we show that  in generalized linear model, variants of both output and objective perturbation algorithms have no \\em explicit dependence on p. Our results assume that the underlying loss function is a 1-Lipschitz convex function and we show that the excess risk depends only on  L_2 norm of the true risk minimizer and that of training points.  Next, we present a novel privacy preserving algorithm for risk minimization over simplex in the generalized linear model, where the loss function is  a doubly differentiable convex function. Assuming that the training points have bounded L_\u221e-norm, our algorithm provides risk bound that has only \\em logarithmic dependence on p. We also apply our technique to the online learning setting and obtain a regret bound with similar logarithmic dependence on p. In contrast, the existing differentially private online learning methods incur O(\\sqrtp)  dependence.",

Using the empirical statistical leverage scores as an importance sampling distribution, the method of algorithmic leveraging samples and rescales rows/columns of data matrices to reduce the data size before performing computations on the subproblem. Existing work has focused on algorithmic issues, but none of it addresses statistical aspects of this method.  Here, we provide an effective framework to evaluate the statistical properties of algorithmic leveraging in the context of estimating parameters in a linear regression model.   In particular, for several versions of leverage-based sampling, we derive results for the bias and variance, both conditional and unconditional on the observed data. We show that from the statistical perspective of bias and variance, neither leverage-based sampling nor uniform sampling dominates the other. This result is particularly striking, given the well-known result that, from the algorithmic perspective of worst-case analysis, leverage-based sampling provides uniformly superior worst-case algorithmic results, when compared with uniform sampling. Based on these theoretical results, we propose and analyze two new leveraging algorithms: one constructs a smaller least-squares problem with \u201cshrinked\u201d leverage scores (SLEV), and the other solves a smaller and unweighted (or biased) least-squares problem (LEVUNW). The empirical results indicate that our theory is a good predictor of practical performance of existing and new leverage-based algorithms and that the new algorithms achieve improved performance.",

Here, we provide an effective framework to evaluate the statistical properties of algorithmic leveraging in the context of estimating parameters in a linear regression model.   In particular, for several versions of leverage-based sampling, we derive results for the bias and variance, both conditional and unconditional on the observed data. We show that from the statistical perspective of bias and variance, neither leverage-based sampling nor uniform sampling dominates the other. This result is particularly striking, given the well-known result that, from the algorithmic perspective of worst-case analysis, leverage-based sampling provides uniformly superior worst-case algorithmic results, when compared with uniform sampling. Based on these theoretical results, we propose and analyze two new leveraging algorithms: one constructs a smaller least-squares problem with \u201cshrinked\u201d leverage scores (SLEV), and the other solves a smaller and unweighted (or biased) least-squares problem (LEVUNW). The empirical results indicate that our theory is a good predictor of practical performance of existing and new leverage-based algorithms and that the new algorithms achieve improved performance.}\n}",

        "abstract": "Efficient detection of multiple object instances is one of the fundamental challenges in computer vision. For certain object categories, even the best automatic systems are yet unable to produce high-quality detection results, and fully manual annotation would be an expensive process. How can detection algorithms interplay with human expert annotators? To make the best use of scarce (human) labeling resources, one needs to decide when to invoke the expert, such that the best possible performance can be achieved while requiring a minimum amount of supervision.   In this paper, we propose a principled approach to active object detection, and show that for a rich class of base detectors algorithms, one can derive a natural sequential decision problem for deciding when to invoke expert supervision. We further show that the objective function satisfies adaptive submodularity, which allows us to derive strong performance guarantees for our algorithm. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm on three real-world tasks, including a problem for biodiversity monitoring from micro UAVs in the Sumatra rain forest. Our results show that active detection not only outperforms its passive counterpart; for certain tasks, it also works significantly better than straightforward application of existing active learning techniques. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to rigorously address the active detection problem from both empirical and theoretical perspectives.",

These algorithms use varying assumptions about the similarity between the tasks to carry information from the source to the target task.  Common assumptions are that only certain specific marginal or conditional distributions have changed while all else remains the same. Alternatively, if one has only the target task, but also has the ability to choose a limited amount of additional training data to collect, then active learning algorithms are used to make choices which will most improve performance on the target task.

        "abstract": "We consider the infinite-horizon discounted optimal control problem  formalized by Markov Decision Processes. We focus on several  approximate variations of the Policy Iteration algorithm: Approximate Policy Iteration, Conservative Policy Iteration  (CPI), a natural adaptation of the Policy Search by  Dynamic Programming algorithm to the  infinite-horizon case (PSDP_\u221e), and the recently proposed  Non-Stationary Policy iteration (NSPI(m)). For all  algorithms, we describe performance bounds, and  make a comparison by paying a particular attention to the  concentrability constants involved, the number of iterations and the  memory required.

We further provide extensive numerical evidence that a proposed two-phase sampling algorithm can perform nearly as well as local-coherence sampling and without requiring a priori knowledge of the matrix coherence structure.  Finally, we apply our results to quantify how weighted nuclear norm minimization can improve on unweighted minimization given an arbitrary set of sampled entries.}\n}",

Our approach is evaluated in the context of log-bilinear language models, rendered suitably efficient for implementation inside a machine translation decoder by factoring the vocabulary.

Persistent homology appears as a fundamental tool in this field. We show that  the use of persistent homology can be naturally considered in general statistical frameworks. We establish convergence rates of persistence diagrams associated to data randomly sampled from any compact metric space to a well defined limit diagram encoding the topological features of the support of the measure from which the data have been sampled.

        "abstract": "The query complexity of \\em locality sensitive hashing (LSH) based similarity search is dominated by the number of hash evaluations, and this number grows with the data size\u00a0\\citeProc:Indyk_STOC98. In industrial applications such as search where the data are often high-dimensional and binary (e.g., text n-grams),  \\em minwise hashing is widely adopted, which requires applying a large number  of permutations on the data. This is  costly in computation and energy-consumption.    In this paper, we propose a  hashing technique which generates all the necessary hash evaluations needed for similarity search, using  one single permutation.  The heart of the proposed hash function is a  \u201crotation\u201d scheme which densifies the sparse sketches of \\em one permutation hashing\u00a0\\citeProc:Li_Owen_Zhang_NIPS12 in an unbiased fashion thereby maintaining the LSH property. This makes the obtained sketches suitable for hash table construction. This idea of rotation presented in this paper could be of independent  interest  for densifying  other types of sparse sketches.

In industrial applications such as search where the data are often high-dimensional and binary (e.g., text n-grams),  \\em minwise hashing is widely adopted, which requires applying a large number  of permutations on the data. This is  costly in computation and energy-consumption.    In this paper, we propose a  hashing technique which generates all the necessary hash evaluations needed for similarity search, using  one single permutation.  The heart of the proposed hash function is a  \u201crotation\u201d scheme which densifies the sparse sketches of \\em one permutation hashing\u00a0\\citeProc:Li_Owen_Zhang_NIPS12 in an unbiased fashion thereby maintaining the LSH property. This makes the obtained sketches suitable for hash table construction. This idea of rotation presented in this paper could be of independent  interest  for densifying  other types of sparse sketches.

        "abstract": "In large scale learning problems it is often easy to collect simple statistics of the data, but hard or impractical to store all the original data. A key question in this setting is how to construct classifiers based on such partial information. One traditional approach to the problem has been to use maximum entropy arguments to induce a complete distribution on variables from statistics. However, this approach essentially makes conditional independence assumptions about the distribution, and furthermore does not optimize prediction loss. Here we present a framework for discriminative learning given a set of statistics. Specifically, we address the case where all variables are discrete and we have access to various marginals.  Our approach minimizes the worst case hinge loss in this case, which upper bounds the generalization error.

A key question in this setting is how to construct classifiers based on such partial information. One traditional approach to the problem has been to use maximum entropy arguments to induce a complete distribution on variables from statistics. However, this approach essentially makes conditional independence assumptions about the distribution, and furthermore does not optimize prediction loss. Here we present a framework for discriminative learning given a set of statistics. Specifically, we address the case where all variables are discrete and we have access to various marginals.  Our approach minimizes the worst case hinge loss in this case, which upper bounds the generalization error. We show that for certain sets of statistics the problem is tractable, and in the general case can be approximated using MAP LP relaxations. Empirical results show that the method is competitive with other approaches that use the same input.}\n}",

Our main contribution is a novel supervised learning algorithm which extends the classical Boosting framework by combining it with dynamic programming. The resulting process alternatively improves the performance of individual strong predictors and the estimated change-points in the training sequence. Empirical evaluation is presented for the proposed method on tasks where change-points arise naturally as part of a classification problem. Finally we show the applicability of the algorithm to macro-action discovery in imitation learning and demonstrate it allows us to solve complex image-based goal-planning problems with thousands of features.",

Our main contribution is a novel supervised learning algorithm which extends the classical Boosting framework by combining it with dynamic programming. The resulting process alternatively improves the performance of individual strong predictors and the estimated change-points in the training sequence. Empirical evaluation is presented for the proposed method on tasks where change-points arise naturally as part of a classification problem. Finally we show the applicability of the algorithm to macro-action discovery in imitation learning and demonstrate it allows us to solve complex image-based goal-planning problems with thousands of features.}\n}",

This result improves significantly over the previously best known sample complexity in the noisy setting, which is O(s \\log n/\u03b5^4).

        "abstract": "We study the problem of aggregating the contributions of multiple contributors in a crowdsourcing setting.  The data involved is in a form not typically considered in most crowdsourcing tasks, in that the data is structured and has a temporal dimension.  In particular, we study the visual tracking problem in which the unknown data to  be estimated is in the form of a sequence of bounding boxes representing the trajectory of the target object being tracked.  We propose a factorial hidden Markov model (FHMM) for ensemble-based tracking by learning jointly the unknown trajectory of the target and the reliability of each tracker in the ensemble.  For efficient online inference of the FHMM, we devise a conditional particle filter algorithm by exploiting the structure of the joint posterior distribution of the hidden variables.

We propose a factorial hidden Markov model (FHMM) for ensemble-based tracking by learning jointly the unknown trajectory of the target and the reliability of each tracker in the ensemble.

It is well known that standard algorithms such as logistic regression do not perform well on this task as they tend to under-estimate the probability of the rare class.

Recently, Wang & Dey (2010) suggested the use of a parametrized family of asymmetric link functions based on the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, which has been used for modeling rare events in statistics. The approach showed promising initial results, but combined with the logarithmic CPE loss implicitly used in their work, it results in a non-convex composite loss that is difficult to optimize. In this paper, we use tools from the theory of proper composite losses (Buja et al, 2005; Reid & Williamson, 2010) to construct a canonical underlying CPE loss corresponding to the GEV link, which yields a convex proper composite loss that we call the GEV-canonical loss; this loss is tailored for the task of CPE when one class is rare, and is easy to minimize using an IRLS-type algorithm similar to that used for logistic regression.

Dual block-coordinate descent methods are among the most efficient solvers, however, they are prone to get stuck in sub-optimal  points. Although subgradient approaches achieve global convergence, they are typically slower in practice. To improve convergence speed, algorithms which compute the steepest \u03b5-descent direction by solving a quadratic program have been proposed. In this paper we suggest to decouple the quadratic program based on the Frank-Wolfe approach.

Although maximum likelihood learning is computationally hard, there do exist consistent learning algorithms (e.g., psuedo-likelihood and its variants).

We focus on a particular class of models, namely high girth graphs in the correlation decay regime.

        "abstract": "A Kernel Adaptive Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is introduced, for the purpose of sampling from a target distribution with strongly nonlinear support. The algorithm embeds the trajectory of the Markov chain into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), such that the feature space covariance of the samples informs the choice of proposal. The procedure is computationally efficient and straightforward to implement, since the RKHS moves can be integrated out analytically: our proposal distribution in the original space is a normal distribution whose mean and covariance depend on where the current sample lies in the support of the target distribution, and adapts to its local covariance structure.

The algorithm embeds the trajectory of the Markov chain into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), such that the feature space covariance of the samples informs the choice of proposal. The procedure is computationally efficient and straightforward to implement, since the RKHS moves can be integrated out analytically: our proposal distribution in the original space is a normal distribution whose mean and covariance depend on where the current sample lies in the support of the target distribution, and adapts to its local covariance structure.

To optimize the ERM problem, we develop techniques that exploit the structure of specific loss functions - such as the squared loss function - to obtain efficient algorithms. We further show that our learning framework admits excess risk bounds even in the presence of missing labels. Our bounds are tight and demonstrate better generalization performance for low-rank promoting trace-norm regularization when compared to (rank insensitive) Frobenius norm regularization.

By a \u201chub-networked\u201d graph, we mean a graph with a few \u201chub nodes\u201d with very large degrees. State of the art estimators for Ising models have a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the maximum node-degree, and are thus ill-suited to recovering such graphs with a few hub nodes. Some recent proposals for specifically recovering hub graphical models do not come with theoretical guarantees, and even empirically provide limited improvements over vanilla Ising model estimators. Here, we show that under such low sample settings, instead of estimating \u201cdifficult\u201d components such as hub-neighborhoods, we can use quantitative indicators of our inability to do so, and thereby identify hub-nodes. This simple procedure allows us to recover hub-networked graphs with very strong statistical guarantees even under very low sample settings.",

Secondly, we show that if we use complex-valued weights   (the target function can still be real), then under suitable   conditions, there are no \u201crobust local minima\u201d: the neural network   can always escape a local minimum by performing a random   perturbation. This property does not hold for real-valued weights.   Thirdly, we discuss whether sparse polynomials can be learned   with \\emphsmall neural networks, where the size is dependent on the   sparsity of the target function.}\n}",

However, models that just extract a single set of invariant features do not exploit the relationships among the latent factors. To address this we propose a higher-order Boltzmann machine that incorporates multiplicative interactions among groups of hidden units that each learn to encode a factor of variation. Furthermore, we propose a manifold-based training strategy that allows effective disentangling, meaning that units in each group encode a distinct type of variation.

        "abstract": "In recent times, many real world applications have emerged that require estimates of class ratios in an unlabeled instance collection as opposed to labels of individual instances in the collection.  In this paper we investigate the use of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) for estimating such ratios. First, we theoretically analyze the MMD-based estimates. Our analysis establishes that, under some mild conditions, the estimate is statistically consistent. More importantly, it provides an upper bound on the error in the estimate in terms of intuitive geometric quantities like class separation and data spread. Next, we use the insights obtained from the theoretical analysis, to propose a novel convex formulation that automatically learns the kernel to be employed in the MMD-based estimation.

In this paper we investigate the use of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) for estimating such ratios. First, we theoretically analyze the MMD-based estimates. Our analysis establishes that, under some mild conditions, the estimate is statistically consistent. More importantly, it provides an upper bound on the error in the estimate in terms of intuitive geometric quantities like class separation and data spread. Next, we use the insights obtained from the theoretical analysis, to propose a novel convex formulation that automatically learns the kernel to be employed in the MMD-based estimation. We design an efficient cutting plane algorithm for solving this formulation.  Finally, we empirically compare our estimator with several existing methods, and show significantly improved performance under varying datasets, class ratios, and training sizes.}\n}",

Optimal policies actively need to discover  objects to achieve a goal; planning in such domains in general amounts to a POMDP problem, where the belief is about the existence and properties of potential not-yet-discovered objects. We propose a computationally efficient extension of model-based relational RL methods that approximates these beliefs using discrete uncertainty predicates. In this formulation the belief update  is learned using probabilistic rules and planning in the approximated belief space can be achieved  using an extension of existing planners. We prove that the learned belief update rules encode an approximation of the exact belief updates of a POMDP formulation and demonstrate experimentally that the proposed approach successfully  learns a set of relational rules appropriate to solve  such problems.",

Despite some practical advances on this problem, from the theoretical point of view, the error-correction ability of existing algorithms are limited by a constant barrier \u2014 none of them can provably recover the correct solution when more than a constant fraction of input correspondences are corrupted. Moreover, prior approaches focus mostly on fully similar objects, while it is practically more demanding and realistic to match instances that are only partially similar to each other.      In this paper, we propose an algorithm to jointly match multiple objects that exhibit only partial similarities, where the provided pairwise feature correspondences can be densely corrupted.

We propose a fast non-iterative approximate inference method that uses a feedforward network to implement efficient exact sampling from the variational posterior. The model and this inference network are trained jointly by maximizing a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood. Although the naive estimator of the inference network gradient is too high-variance to be useful, we make it practical by applying several straightforward model-independent variance reduction techniques.

        "abstract": "Our objective is to develop formulations and algorithms for efficiently computing the feature selection path \u2013 i.e. the variation in classification accuracy as the fraction of selected features is varied from null to unity. Multiple Kernel Learning subject to l_p\\geq1 regularization (l_p-MKL) has been demonstrated to be one of the most effective techniques for non-linear feature selection. However, state-of-the-art l_p-MKL algorithms are too computationally expensive to be invoked thousands of times to determine the entire path.    We propose a novel conjecture which states that, for certain l_p-MKL formulations, the number of features selected in the optimal solution monotonically decreases as p is decreased from an initial value to unity. We prove the conjecture, for a generic family of kernel target alignment based formulations, and show that the feature weights themselves decay (grow) monotonically once they are below (above) a certain threshold at optimality. This allows us to develop a path following algorithm that systematically generates optimal feature sets of decreasing size. The proposed algorithm sets certain feature weights directly to zero for potentially large intervals of p thereby reducing optimization costs while simultaneously providing approximation guarantees.    We empirically demonstrate that our formulation can lead to classification accuracies which are as much as 10% higher on benchmark data sets not only as compared to other l_p-MKL formulations and uniform kernel baselines but also leading feature selection methods.

Multiple Kernel Learning subject to l_p\\geq1 regularization (l_p-MKL) has been demonstrated to be one of the most effective techniques for non-linear feature selection. However, state-of-the-art l_p-MKL algorithms are too computationally expensive to be invoked thousands of times to determine the entire path.    We propose a novel conjecture which states that, for certain l_p-MKL formulations, the number of features selected in the optimal solution monotonically decreases as p is decreased from an initial value to unity. We prove the conjecture, for a generic family of kernel target alignment based formulations, and show that the feature weights themselves decay (grow) monotonically once they are below (above) a certain threshold at optimality. This allows us to develop a path following algorithm that systematically generates optimal feature sets of decreasing size. The proposed algorithm sets certain feature weights directly to zero for potentially large intervals of p thereby reducing optimization costs while simultaneously providing approximation guarantees.    We empirically demonstrate that our formulation can lead to classification accuracies which are as much as 10% higher on benchmark data sets not only as compared to other l_p-MKL formulations and uniform kernel baselines but also leading feature selection methods. We further demonstrate that our algorithm reduces training time significantly over other path following algorithms and state-of-the-art l_p-MKL optimizers such as SMO-MKL. In particular, we generate the entire feature selection path for data sets with a hundred thousand features in approximately half an hour on standard hardware.}\n}",

Although improving the robustness of SVM has been investigated for long time, robust SVM (RSVM) learning still poses two major challenges: obtaining a good (local) solution from a non-convex optimization problem and optimally controlling the robustness-efficiency trade-off. In this paper, we address these two issues simultaneously in an integrated way by introducing a novel homotopy approach to RSVM learning. Based on theoretical investigation of the geometry of RSVM solutions, we show that a path of local RSVM solutions can be computed efficiently when the influence of outliers is gradually suppressed as simulated annealing. We experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm tends to produce better local solutions than the alternative approach based on the concave-convex procedure, with the ability of stable and efficient model selection for controlling the influence of outliers.",

        "abstract": "In applications of graphical models arising in domains such as computer vision and signal processing, we often seek the most likely configurations of high-dimensional, continuous variables.  We develop a particle-based max-product algorithm which maintains a diverse set of posterior mode hypotheses, and is robust to initialization.  At each iteration, the set of hypotheses at each node is augmented via stochastic proposals, and then reduced via an efficient selection algorithm.  The integer program underlying our optimization-based particle selection minimizes errors in subsequent max-product message updates.  This objective automatically encourages diversity in the maintained hypotheses, without requiring tuning of application-specific distances among hypotheses.

We develop a particle-based max-product algorithm which maintains a diverse set of posterior mode hypotheses, and is robust to initialization.  At each iteration, the set of hypotheses at each node is augmented via stochastic proposals, and then reduced via an efficient selection algorithm.  The integer program underlying our optimization-based particle selection minimizes errors in subsequent max-product message updates.  This objective automatically encourages diversity in the maintained hypotheses, without requiring tuning of application-specific distances among hypotheses.

GPstruct is a recently proposed structured prediction model that offers appealing properties such as being kernelised, non-parametric, and supporting Bayesian inference (Brati\u00e8res et al. 2013).   The model places a Gaussian process prior over energy functions which describe relationships between input variables and structured output variables.

        "abstract": "The support vector machine (SVM) is a widely used method for classification. Although many efforts have been devoted to develop efficient solvers, it remains challenging to apply SVM to large-scale problems. A nice property of SVM is that the non-support vectors have no effect on the resulting classifier. Motivated by this observation, we present fast and efficient screening rules to discard non-support vectors by analyzing the dual problem of SVM via variational inequalities (DVI). As a result, the number of data instances to be entered into the optimization can be substantially reduced. Some appealing features of our screening method are: (1) DVI is safe in the sense that the vectors discarded by DVI are guaranteed to be non-support vectors; (2) the data set needs to be scanned only once to run the screening, and its computational cost is negligible compared to that of solving the SVM problem; (3) DVI is independent of the solvers and can be integrated with any existing efficient solver. We also show that the DVI technique can be extended to detect non-support vectors in the least absolute deviations regression (LAD). To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no screening methods for LAD.  We have evaluated DVI on both synthetic and real data sets. Experiments indicate that DVI significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art screening rules for SVM, and it is very effective in discarding non-support vectors for LAD. The speedup gained by DVI rules can be up to two orders of magnitude.",

However, prior research has shown that the representations computed by OMP may be of inferior quality, as they deliver suboptimal classification accuracy on several im- age datasets. We have found that this problem is caused by OMP\u2019s relatively weak stability under data variations, which leads to unreliability in supervised classifier training. We show that by imposing a simple nonnegativity constraint, this nonnegative variant of OMP (NOMP) can mitigate OMP\u2019s stability issue and is resistant to noise overfitting. In this work, we provide extensive analysis and experimental results to examine and validate the stability advantage of NOMP. In our experiments, we use a multi-layer deep architecture for representation learning, where we use K-means for feature learning and NOMP for representation encoding. The resulting learning framework is not only efficient and scalable to large feature dictionaries, but also is robust against input noise. This framework achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on the STL-10 dataset.",

However, prior research has shown that the representations computed by OMP may be of inferior quality, as they deliver suboptimal classification accuracy on several im- age datasets. We have found that this problem is caused by OMP\u2019s relatively weak stability under data variations, which leads to unreliability in supervised classifier training. We show that by imposing a simple nonnegativity constraint, this nonnegative variant of OMP (NOMP) can mitigate OMP\u2019s stability issue and is resistant to noise overfitting. In this work, we provide extensive analysis and experimental results to examine and validate the stability advantage of NOMP. In our experiments, we use a multi-layer deep architecture for representation learning, where we use K-means for feature learning and NOMP for representation encoding. The resulting learning framework is not only efficient and scalable to large feature dictionaries, but also is robust against input noise. This framework achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on the STL-10 dataset.}\n}",

Previous work has shown that it is beneficial to make an adjustment for chance to this measure, by subtracting an expected value and normalizing via an upper bound. This yields the constant baseline property that enhances intuitiveness. In this paper, we argue that a further type of statistical adjustment for the mutual information is also beneficial - an adjustment to correct selection bias. This type of adjustment is useful when carrying out many clustering comparisons, to select one or more preferred clusterings. It reduces the tendency for the mutual information to choose clustering solutions i) with more clusters, or ii) induced on fewer data points, when compared to a reference one. We term our new adjusted measure the *standardized mutual information*. It requires computation of the variance of mutual information under a hypergeometric model of randomness, which is technically challenging. We derive an analytical formula for this variance and analyze its complexity. We then experimentally assess how our new measure can address selection bias and also increase interpretability.

        "abstract": "The Recurrent temporal restricted Boltzmann machine (RTRBM) is a probabilistic model for temporal data, that has been shown to effectively capture both short and long-term dependencies in time-series. The topology of the RTRBM graphical model, however, assumes full connectivity between all the pairs of visible and hidden units, therefore ignoring the dependency structure between the different observations. Learning this structure has the potential to not only improve the prediction performance, but it can also reveal important patterns in the data. For example, given an econometric dataset, we could identify interesting dependencies between different market sectors; given a meteorological dataset, we could identify regional weather patterns. In this work we propose a new class of RTRBM, which explicitly uses a dependency graph to model the structure in the problem and to define the energy function. We refer to the new model as the structured RTRBM (SRTRBM). Our technique is related to methods such as graphical lasso, which are used to learn the topology of Gaussian graphical models. We also develop a spike-and-slab version of the RTRBM, and combine it with our method to learn structure in datasets with real valued observations. Our experimental results using synthetic and real datasets, demonstrate that the SRTRBM can improve the prediction performance of the RTRBM, particularly when the number of visible units is large and the size of the training set is small. It also reveals the structure underlying our benchmark datasets.",

The reward of the complex action is some function of the basic arms\u2019 rewards, and the feedback observed may not necessarily be the reward per-arm. For instance, when the complex actions are subsets of the arms, we may only observe the maximum reward over the chosen subset. Thus, feedback across complex actions may be coupled due to the nature of the reward function. We prove a frequentist regret bound for Thompson sampling in a very general setting involving parameter, action and observation spaces and a likelihood function over them. The bound holds for discretely-supported priors over the parameter space and without additional structural properties such as closed-form posteriors, conjugate prior structure or independence across arms. The regret bound scales logarithmically with time but, more importantly, with an improved constant that non-trivially captures the coupling across complex actions due to the structure of the rewards. As applications, we derive improved regret bounds for classes of complex bandit problems involving selecting subsets of arms, including the first nontrivial regret bounds for nonlinear MAX reward feedback from subsets. Using particle filters for computing posterior distributions which lack an explicit closed-form, we present numerical results for the performance of Thompson sampling for subset-selection and job scheduling problems.",

We apply a minimax analysis, beginning with the fixed horizon case, and then moving on to two unknown-horizon settings, one that assumes the horizon is chosen randomly according to some distribution, and the other which allows the adversary full control over the horizon. For the random horizon setting with restricted losses, we derive a fully optimal minimax algorithm. And for the adversarial horizon setting, we prove a nontrivial lower bound which shows that the adversary obtains strictly more power than when the horizon is fixed and known. Based on the minimax solution of the random horizon setting, we then propose a new adaptive algorithm which \u201cpretends\u201d that the horizon is drawn from a distribution from a special family, but no matter how the actual horizon is chosen,  the worst-case regret is of the optimal rate. Furthermore, our algorithm can be combined and applied in many ways, for instance, to online convex optimization, follow the perturbed leader, exponential weights algorithm and first order bounds.

We apply a minimax analysis, beginning with the fixed horizon case, and then moving on to two unknown-horizon settings, one that assumes the horizon is chosen randomly according to some distribution, and the other which allows the adversary full control over the horizon. For the random horizon setting with restricted losses, we derive a fully optimal minimax algorithm. And for the adversarial horizon setting, we prove a nontrivial lower bound which shows that the adversary obtains strictly more power than when the horizon is fixed and known. Based on the minimax solution of the random horizon setting, we then propose a new adaptive algorithm which \u201cpretends\u201d that the horizon is drawn from a distribution from a special family, but no matter how the actual horizon is chosen,  the worst-case regret is of the optimal rate. Furthermore, our algorithm can be combined and applied in many ways, for instance, to online convex optimization, follow the perturbed leader, exponential weights algorithm and first order bounds. Experiments show that our algorithm outperforms many other existing algorithms in an online linear optimization setting.}\n}",

The set of arms is either discrete, in which case arms correspond to the vertices of a finite graph whose structure represents similarity in rewards, or continuous, in which case arms belong to a bounded interval. For discrete unimodal bandits, we derive asymptotic lower bounds for the regret achieved under any algorithm, and propose OSUB, an algorithm whose regret matches this lower bound. Our algorithm optimally exploits the unimodal structure of the problem, and surprisingly, its asymptotic regret does not depend on the number of arms. We also provide a regret upper bound for OSUB in non-stationary environments where the expected rewards smoothly evolve over time. The analytical results are supported by numerical experiments showing that OSUB performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art algorithms.

The proposed models include  a) A Bayesian formulation of vMF mixture that enables information sharing among clusters,  b) a Hierarchical vMF mixture that provides multi-scale shrinkage and tree structured view of the data and c) a Temporal vMF mixture that captures evolution of clusters in temporal data.  For posterior inference, we develop fast variational methods  as well as collapsed Gibbs sampling techniques for all three models. Our experiments on six datasets provide strong empirical support in favour of vMF based clustering models over other popular tools such as K-means, Multinomial Mixtures and Latent Dirichlet Allocation.",

We propose a clustering algorithm that is based on optimizing an appropriate weighted objective, where larger weights are given to observations with lower uncertainty. Our approach leads to a convex optimization problem that is efficiently solvable. We analyze our approach under a natural generative model, and establish theoretical guarantees for recovering the underlying clusters. Our main result is a general theorem that applies to any given weight and distribution for the uncertainty. By optimizing over the weights, we derive a provably optimal weighting scheme, which matches the information theoretic lower bound up to logarithmic factors and leads to strong performance bounds in several specific settings. By optimizing over the uncertainty distribution, we show that non-uniform uncertainties can actually help. In particular, if the graph is built by spending a limited amount of resource to take measurement on each node pair, then it is beneficial to allocate the resource in a non-uniform fashion to obtain accurate measurements on a few pairs of nodes, rather than obtaining inaccurate measurements on many pairs. We provide simulation results that validate our theoretical findings.",
