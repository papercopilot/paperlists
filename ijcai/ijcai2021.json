        "abstract": "The non-stationary nature of data streams strongly challenges traditional machine learning techniques. Although some solutions have been proposed to extend traditional machine learning techniques for handling data streams, these approaches either require an initial label set or rely on specialized design parameters. The overlap among classes and the labeling of data streams constitute other major challenges for classifying data streams. In this paper, we proposed a clustering-based data stream classification framework to handle non-stationary data streams without utilizing an initial label set. A density-based stream clustering procedure is used to capture novel concepts with a dynamic threshold and an effective active label querying strategy is introduced to continuously learn the new concepts from the data streams. The sub-cluster structure of each cluster is explored to handle the overlap among classes. Experimental results and quantitative comparison studies reveal that the proposed method provides statistically better or comparable performance than the existing methods.",

        "abstract": "Active learning (AL) is a subfield of machine learning (ML) in which a learning algorithm aims to achieve good accuracy with fewer training samples by interactively querying the oracles to label new data points. Pool-based AL is well-motivated in many ML tasks, where unlabeled data is abundant, but their labels are hard or costly to obtain. Although many pool-based AL methods have been developed, some important questions remain unanswered such as how to: 1) determine the current state-of-the-art technique; 2) evaluate the relative benefit of new methods for various properties of the dataset; 3) understand what specific problems merit greater attention; and 4) measure the progress of the field over time. In this paper, we survey and compare various AL strategies used in both recently proposed and classic highly-cited methods. We propose to benchmark pool-based AL methods with a variety of datasets and quantitative metric, and draw insights from the comparative empirical results.",

In this paper, we propose a compression-compilation co-design framework that can guarantee the identified model meets both resource and real-time specifications of mobile devices. Our framework applies a compiler-aware neural architecture optimization method (CANAO), which can generate the optimal compressed model that balances both accuracy and latency. We are able to achieve up to 7.8x speedup compared with TensorFlow-Lite with only minor accuracy loss. We present two types of BERT applications on mobile devices: Question Answering (QA) and Text Generation. Both can be executed in real-time with latency as low as 45ms.

Despite their clear potential as a backbone for explainable AI, existing ontologies tend to be highly incomplete, which acts as a significant barrier to their more widespread adoption. To mitigate this issue, we present a mechanism to infer plausible missing knowledge, which relies on reasoning by analogy.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that studies analogical reasoning within the setting of description logic ontologies. After showing that the standard formalisation of analogical proportion has important limitations in this setting, we introduce an alternative semantics based on bijective mappings between sets of features. We then analyse the properties of analogies under the proposed semantics, and show among others how it enables two plausible inference patterns: rule translation and rule extrapolation.",

        "abstract": "When designing or analyzing multi-agent systems, a fundamental problem is responsibility ascription: to specify which agents are responsible for the joint outcome of their behaviors and to which extent. We model strategic multi-agent interaction as an extensive form game of imperfect information and define notions of forward (prospective) and backward (retrospective) responsibility. Forward responsibility identifies the responsibility of a group of agents for an outcome along all possible plays, whereas backward responsibility identifies the responsibility along a given play. We further distinguish between strategic and causal backward responsibility, where the former captures the epistemic knowledge of players along a play, while the latter formalizes which players \u2013 possibly unknowingly \u2013 caused the outcome. A formal connection between forward and backward notions is established in the case of perfect recall. We further ascribe quantitative responsibility through cooperative game theory. We show through a number of examples that our approach encompasses several prior formal accounts of responsibility attribution.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The challenges of visible-thermal person re-identification (VT-ReID) lies in the inter-modality discrepancy and the intra-modality variations. An appropriate metric learning plays a crucial role in optimizing the feature similarity between the two modalities. However,  most existing metric learning-based methods mainly constrain the similarity between individual instances or class centers, which are inadequate to explore the rich data relationships in the cross-modality data. Besides, most of these methods fail to consider the importance of different pairs, incurring an inefficiency and ineffectiveness of optimization. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Constraint (MC) similarity learning method that jointly considers the cross-modality relationships from three different aspects, i.e., Instance-to-Instance (I2I), Center-to-Instance (C2I), and Center-to-Center (C2C). Moreover, we devise an Adaptive Weighting Loss (AWL) function to implement the MC efficiently. In the AWL, we first use an adaptive margin pair mining to select informative pairs and then adaptively adjust weights of mined pairs based on their similarity. Finally, the mined and weighted pairs are used for the metric learning. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed over the state-of-the-art methods.",

The problem arises in social network analysis and has found applications in many important areas employing graph-based data mining. Existing exact algorithms usually implement a branch-and-bound approach that requires a tight upper bound to reduce the search space. In this paper, we propose a new upper bound for MKP, which is a partitioning of the candidate vertex set with respect to the constructing solution. We implement a new branch-and-bound algorithm that employs the upper bound to reduce the number of branches. Experimental results show that the upper bound is very effective in reducing the search space. The new algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms significantly on real-world massive graphs, DIMACS graphs and random graphs.",

        "abstract": "Text-based diagnosis classification is a critical problem in AI-enabled healthcare studies, which assists clinicians in making correct decision and lowering the rate of diagnostic errors. Previous studies follow the routine of sequence based deep learning models in NLP literature to deal with clinical notes. However, recent studies find that structural information is important in clinical contents that greatly impacts the predictions. In this paper, a novel sequence-to-subgraph framework is introduced to process clinical texts for classification, which changes the paradigm of managing texts. Moreover, a new classification model under the framework is proposed that incorporates subgraph convolutional network and hierarchical diagnostic attentive network to extract the layered structural features of clinical texts. The evaluation conducted on both the real-world English and Chinese datasets shows that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning based diagnosis classification models.",

        "abstract": "Decomposition approach is an important component in multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), which is a popular method for handing many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs). This paper presents a theoretical analysis on the convergence ability of using the typical weighted sum (WS), Tchebycheff (TCH) or penalty-based boundary intersection (PBI) approach in a basic MOEA/D for solving two benchmark MaOPs. The results show that using WS, the algorithm can always find an optimal solution for any subproblem in polynomial expected runtime. In contrast, the algorithm needs at least exponential expected runtime for some subproblems if using TCH or PBI. Moreover, our analyses discover an obvious shortcoming of using WS, that is, the optimal solutions of different subproblems are easily corresponding to the same solution. In addition, this analysis indicates that if using PBI, a small value of the penalty parameter is a good choice for faster converging to the Pareto front, but it may lose the diversity. This study reveals some optimization behaviors of using three typical decomposition approaches in the well-known MOEA/D framework for solving MaOPs.",

        "abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) is a widely studied task in natural language processing. Recently, a growing number of studies have focused on the nested NER. The span-based methods, considering the entity recognition as a span classification task, can deal with nested entities naturally. But they suffer from the huge search space and the lack of interactions between entities. To address these issues, we propose a novel sequence-to-set neural network for nested NER. Instead of specifying candidate spans in advance, we provide a fixed set of learnable vectors to learn the patterns of the valuable spans. We utilize a non-autoregressive decoder to predict the final set of entities in one pass, in which we are able to capture dependencies between entities. Compared with the sequence-to-sequence method, our model is more suitable for such unordered recognition task as it is insensitive to the label order. In addition, we utilize the loss function based on bipartite matching to compute the overall training loss. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art on three nested NER corpora: ACE 2004, ACE 2005 and KBP 2017.

Recent progress has been made by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), so that promising results can be obtained through real-time end-to-end architectures. However, convolutional architectures tend to focus on local information and neglect long-range spatial dependency, which limits the ability of existing approaches in keeping global structural information. In this paper, we propose a Sketch-Transformer network for face photo-sketch synthesis, which consists of three closely-related modules, including a multi-scale feature and position encoder for patch-level feature and position embedding, a self-attention module for capturing long-range spatial dependency, and a multi-scale spatially-adaptive de-normalization decoder for image reconstruction. Such a design enables the model to generate reasonable detail texture while maintaining global structural information. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches on both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.",

        "abstract": "End-to-end spoken language understanding (SLU) recently attracted increasing interest. Compared to the conventional tandem-based approach that combines speech recognition and language understanding as separate modules, the new approach extracts users' intentions directly from the speech signals, resulting in joint optimization and low latency. Such an approach, however, is typically designed to process one intent at a time, which leads users to have to take multiple rounds to fulfill their requirements while interacting with a dialogue system. In this paper, we propose a streaming end-to-end framework that can process multiple intentions in an online and incremental way. The backbone of our framework is a unidirectional RNN trained with the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) criterion. By this design, an intention can be identified when sufficient evidence has been accumulated, and  multiple intentions will be identified sequentially. We evaluate our solution on the Fluent Speech Commands (FSC) dataset and the detection accuracy is about 97 % on all multi-intent settings. This result is comparable to the performance of the state-of-the-art non-streaming models, but is achieved in an online and incremental way. We also employ our model to an keyword spotting task using the Google Speech Commands dataset, and the results are also highly promising.",

This paper focuses on predicting discourse dependency structures for multi-party dialogues. Previous work adopts incremental methods that take the features from the already predicted discourse relations to help generate the next one. Although the inter-correlations among predictions considered, we find that the error propagation is also very serious and hurts the overall performance. To alleviate error propagation, we propose a Structure Self-Aware (SSA) model, which adopts a novel edge-centric Graph Neural Network (GNN) to update the information between each Elementary Discourse Unit (EDU) pair layer by layer, so that expressive representations can be learned without historical predictions. In addition, we take auxiliary training signals (e.g. structure distillation) for better representation learning. Our model achieves the new state-of-the-art performances on two conversational discourse parsing benchmarks, largely outperforming the previous methods.",

While research on this problem gathered momentum as an offshoot of plan recognition, recent research has established it as a major subject of research on its own, leading to numerous new approaches that both expand the expressivity of domains in which to perform goal recognition and substantial advances to the state-of-the-art on established domain types. In this survey, we focus on the advances to goal recognition achieved in the last decade, categorizing the resulting techniques and identifying a number of opportunities for further breakthrough research.",

In particular, we first formulate the problem of response selection and review state-of-the-art context-response matching models categorized by their architecture. \r\nThen we summarize some recent advances on the research of response selection, including incorporation with extra knowledge and exploration on more effective model learning.

        "abstract": "Generalized planning aims at finding a general solution for a set of similar planning problems. Abstractions are widely used to solve such problems. However, the connections among these abstraction works remain vague. Thus, to facilitate a deep understanding and further exploration of abstraction approaches for generalized planning, it is important to develop a uniform abstraction framework for generalized planning. Recently, Banihashemi et al. proposed an agent abstraction framework based on the situation calculus. However, expressiveness of such an abstraction framework is limited. In this paper, by extending their abstraction framework, we propose a uniform abstraction framework for generalized planning. We formalize a generalized planning problem as a triple of a basic action theory, a trajectory constraint, and a goal. Then we define the concepts of sound abstractions of a generalized planning problem. We show that solutions to a generalized planning problem are nicely related to those of its sound abstractions. We also define and analyze the dual notion of complete abstractions. Finally, we review some important abstraction works for generalized planning and show that they can be formalized in our framework.",

Further, these measures have been studied under differing assumptions, thus precluding the possibility of designing a single framework that captures these measures under the same assumptions.\r\nIn this paper, we present a unifying Bayesian framework that models a human observer's evolving beliefs about an agent and thereby define the problem of Generalized Human-Aware Planning. We will show that the definitions of interpretability measures like explicability, legibility and predictability from the prior literature fall out as special cases of our general framework. Through this framework, we also bring a previously ignored fact to light that the human-robot interactions are in effect open-world problems, particularly as a result of modeling the human's beliefs over the agent. Since the human may not only hold beliefs unknown to the agent but may also form new hypotheses about the agent when presented with novel or unexpected behaviors.",

        "abstract": "The lexical substitution task aims at finding suitable replacements for words in context. It has proved to be useful in several areas, such as word sense induction and text simplification, as well as in more practical applications such as writing-assistant tools.  However, the paucity of annotated data has forced researchers to apply mainly unsupervised approaches,  limiting the applicability of large pre-trained models and thus hampering the potential benefits of supervised approaches to the task. In this paper, we mitigate this issue by proposing ALaSca, a novel approach to automatically creating large-scale datasets for  English lexical substitution.  ALaSca allows examples to be produced for potentially any word in a language vocabulary and to cover most of the meanings it lists.  Thanks to this,  we can unleash the full potential of neural architectures and finetune them on the lexical substitution task. Indeed,  when using our data, a  transformer-based model performs substantially better than when using manually annotated data only. We release  ALaSca at  https://sapienzanlp.github.io/alasca/.",

        "abstract": "Recently, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be a powerful mean for Computer Aided Diagnosis (CADx). This approach requires building a population graph to aggregate structural information, where the graph adjacency matrix represents the relationship between nodes. Until now, this adjacency matrix is usually defined manually based on phenotypic information. In this paper, we propose an encoder that automatically selects the appropriate phenotypic measures according to their spatial distribution, and uses the text similarity awareness mechanism to calculate the edge weights between nodes. The encoder can automatically construct the population graph using phenotypic measures which have a positive impact on the final results, and further realizes the fusion of multimodal information. In addition, a novel graph convolution network architecture using multi-layer aggregation mechanism is proposed. The structure can obtain deep structure information while suppressing over-smooth, and increase the similarity between the same type of nodes. Experimental results on two databases show that our method can significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy for Autism spectrum disorder and breast cancer, indicating its universality in leveraging multimodal data for disease prediction.",

To relieve those efforts, we explore the potential of neural architecture search (NAS) and introduce AMEIR for Automatic behavior Modeling, interaction Exploration and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) Investigation in the Recommender system. Specifically, AMEIR divides the complete recommendation models into three stages of behavior modeling, interaction exploration, MLP aggregation, and introduces a novel search space containing three tailored subspaces that cover most of the existing methods and thus allow for searching better models. To find the ideal architecture efficiently and effectively, AMEIR realizes the one-shot random search in recommendation progressively on the three stages and assembles the search results as the final outcome. The experiment over various scenarios reveals that AMEIR outperforms competitive baselines of elaborate manual design and leading algorithmic complex NAS methods with lower model complexity and comparable time cost, indicating efficacy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed method.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Vignetting is an inherent imaging phenomenon within almost all optical systems, showing as a radial intensity darkening toward the corners of an image. Since it is a common effect for photography and usually appears as a slight intensity variation, people usually regard it as a part of a photo and would not even want to post-process it. Due to this natural advantage, in this work, we study the vignetting from a new viewpoint, i.e., adversarial vignetting attack (AVA), which aims to embed intentionally misleading information into the vignetting and produce a natural adversarial example without noise patterns. This example can fool the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) but is imperceptible to human. To this end, we first propose the radial-isotropic adversarial vignetting attack (RI-AVA) based on the physical model of vignetting, where the physical parameters (e.g., illumination factor and focal length) are tuned through the guidance of target CNN models. To achieve higher transferability across different CNNs, we further propose radial-anisotropic adversarial vignetting attack (RA-AVA) by allowing the effective regions of vignetting to be radial-anisotropic and shape-free. Moreover, we propose the geometry-aware level-set optimization method to solve the adversarial vignetting regions and physical parameters jointly. We validate the proposed methods on three popular datasets, i.e., DEV, CIFAR10, and Tiny ImageNet, by attacking four CNNs, e.g., ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, DenseNet121, and MobileNet-V2, demonstrating the advantages of our methods over baseline methods on both transferability and image quality.",

        "abstract": "For many reasoning-heavy tasks with raw inputs, it is challenging to design an appropriate end-to-end pipeline to formulate the problem-solving process. Some modern AI systems, e.g., Neuro-Symbolic Learning, divide the pipeline into sub-symbolic perception and symbolic reasoning, trying to utilise data-driven machine learning and knowledge-driven problem-solving simultaneously. However, these systems suffer from the exponential computational complexity caused by the interface between the two components, where the sub-symbolic learning model lacks direct supervision, and the symbolic model lacks accurate input facts. Hence, they usually focus on learning the sub-symbolic model with a complete symbolic knowledge base while avoiding a crucial problem: where does the knowledge come from? In this paper, we present Abductive Meta-Interpretive Learning (MetaAbd) that unites abduction and induction to learn neural networks and logic theories jointly from raw data. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaAbd not only outperforms the compared systems in predictive accuracy and data efficiency but also induces logic programs that can be re-used as background knowledge in subsequent learning tasks. To the best of our knowledge, MetaAbd is the first system that can jointly learn neural networks from scratch and induce recursive first-order logic theories with predicate invention.",

        "abstract": "Abductive Learning is a framework that combines machine learning with first-order logical reasoning. It allows machine learning models to exploit complex symbolic domain knowledge represented by first-order logic rules. However, it is challenging to obtain or express the ground-truth domain knowledge explicitly as first-order logic rules in many applications. The only accessible knowledge base is implicitly represented by groundings, i.e., propositions or atomic formulas without variables. This paper proposes Grounded Abductive Learning (GABL) to enhance machine learning models with abductive reasoning in a ground domain knowledge base, which offers inexact supervision through a set of logic propositions. We apply GABL on two weakly supervised learning problems and found that the model's initial accuracy plays a crucial role in learning. The results on a real-world OCR task show that GABL can significantly reduce the effort of data labeling than the compared methods.",

As with logical statements, an argument applies to specific objects in the universe or relations among them, and may have exceptions. In this paper, we propose\r\nan argumentation formalism that allows associating arguments with a domain of application. Appropriate semantics are given, which formalise the notion of partial argument acceptance, i.e. the set of objects or relations that an argument can be applied\r\nto. We show that our proposal is in fact equivalent to the standard Argumentation Frameworks of Dung, but allows a more intuitive and compact expression of some core concepts of commonsense and non-monotonic reasoning, such as the scope of an argument, exceptions, relevance and others.",

        "abstract": "Maximum satisfiability (MaxSat) solving  is an active area of research motivated by numerous successful applications to solving\r\nNP-hard combinatorial optimization problems.  One of the most successful approaches for solving MaxSat instances from real world domains \r\nare the so called  implicit hitting set (IHS) solvers. IHS solvers decouple MaxSat solving into separate core-extraction (i.e. reasoning) and optimization steps which are tackled by a Boolean satisfiability (SAT)  and an integer linear programming (IP) solver, respectively. While the approach shows state-of-the-art performance on many industrial instances, \r\nit is known that there exists instances on which IHS solvers need to extract an exponential number of cores before terminating. Motivated by the simplest of these problematic instances, we propose abstract cores,  a compact representation for a potentially exponential number of regular cores. We demonstrate how to incorporate abstract core reasoning into the IHS algorithm and report on an empirical evaluation demonstrating, that including abstract cores into a state-of-the-art IHS solver improves its performance enough to surpass the best performing solvers of the 2019 MaxSat Evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Despite the increasing interest in neural architecture search (NAS), the significant computational cost of NAS is a hindrance to researchers. Hence, we propose to reduce the cost of NAS using proxy data, i.e., a representative subset of the target data, without sacrificing search performance. Even though data selection has been used across various fields, our evaluation of existing selection methods for NAS algorithms offered by NAS-Bench-1shot1 reveals that they are not always appropriate for NAS and a new selection method is necessary. By analyzing proxy data constructed using various selection methods through data entropy, we propose a novel proxy data selection method tailored for NAS. To empirically demonstrate the effectiveness, we conduct thorough experiments across diverse datasets, search spaces, and NAS algorithms. Consequently, NAS algorithms with the proposed selection discover architectures that are competitive with those obtained using the entire dataset. It significantly reduces the search cost: executing DARTS with the proposed selection requires only 40 minutes on CIFAR-10 and 7.5 hours on ImageNet with a single GPU. Additionally, when the architecture searched on ImageNet using the proposed selection is inversely transferred to CIFAR-10, a state-of-the-art test error of 2.4% is yielded.

Despite these desirable guarantees, it is susceptible to strategic misreporting of preferences by the agents on the other side. We study a novel model of strategic behavior under the deferred acceptance algorithm: manipulation through an accomplice. Here, an agent on the proposed-to side (say, a woman) partners with an agent on the proposing side---an accomplice---to manipulate on her behalf (possibly at the expense of worsening his match). We show that the optimal manipulation strategy for an accomplice comprises of promoting exactly one woman in his true list (i.e., an inconspicuous manipulation). This structural result immediately gives a polynomial-time algorithm for computing an optimal accomplice manipulation. We also study the conditions under which the manipulated matching is stable with respect to the true preferences. Our experimental results show that accomplice manipulation outperforms self manipulation both in terms of the frequency of occurrence as well as the quality of matched partners.",

        "abstract": "Collecting large-scale human-annotated datasets via crowdsourcing to train and improve automated models is a prominent human-in-the-loop approach to integrate human and machine intelligence. However, together with their unique intelligence, humans also come with their biases and subjective beliefs, which may influence the quality of the annotated data and negatively impact the effectiveness of the human-in-the-loop systems. One of the most common types of cognitive biases that humans are subject to is the confirmation bias, which is people's tendency to favor information that confirms their existing beliefs and values. In this paper, we present an algorithmic approach to infer the correct answers of tasks by aggregating the annotations from multiple crowd workers, while taking workers' various levels of confirmation bias into consideration. Evaluations on real-world crowd annotations show that the proposed bias-aware label aggregation algorithm outperforms baseline methods in accurately inferring the ground-truth labels of different tasks when crowd workers indeed exhibit some degree of confirmation bias. Through simulations on synthetic data, we further identify the conditions when the proposed algorithm has the largest advantages over baseline methods.",

We illustrate weaknesses of existing metrics for GRD and propose an alternative better suited to online settings. We provide a formal definition of this Active GRD (AGRD) problem and study an algorithm for solving it.

        "abstract": "We consider the problem to learn a concept or a query in the presence of an ontology formulated in the description logic ELr, in Angluin's framework of active learning that allows the learning algorithm to interactively query an oracle (such as a domain expert). We show that the following can be learned in polynomial time: (1) EL-concepts, (2) symmetry-free ELI-concepts, and (3) conjunctive queries (CQs) that are chordal, symmetry-free, and of bounded arity. In all cases, the learner can pose to the oracle membership queries based on ABoxes and equivalence queries that ask whether a given concept/query from the considered class is equivalent to the target. The restriction to bounded arity in (3) can be removed when we admit unrestricted CQs in equivalence queries. We also show that EL-concepts are not polynomial query learnable in the presence of ELI-ontologies.",

        "abstract": "A number of studies point out that current Visual Question Answering (VQA) models are severely affected by the language prior problem, which refers to blindly making predictions based on the language shortcut. Some efforts have been devoted to overcoming this issue with delicate models. However, there is no research to address it from the view of the answer feature space learning, despite the fact that existing VQA methods all cast VQA as a classification task. Inspired by this, in this work, we attempt to tackle the language prior problem from the viewpoint of the feature space learning. An adapted margin cosine loss is designed to discriminate the frequent and the sparse answer feature space under each question type properly. In this way, the limited patterns within the language modality can be largely reduced to eliminate the language priors. We apply this loss function to several baseline models and evaluate its effectiveness on two VQA-CP benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed adapted margin cosine loss can enhance the baseline models with an absolute performance gain of 15\\% on average, strongly verifying the potential of tackling the language prior problem in VQA from the angle of the answer feature space learning.",

        "abstract": "As cyberattacks caused by malware have proliferated during the pandemic, building an automatic system to detect COVID-19 themed malware in social coding platforms is in urgent need. The existing methods mainly rely on file content analysis while ignoring structured information among entities in social coding platforms. Additionally, they usually require sufficient data for model training, impairing their performances over cases with limited data which is common in reality. To address these challenges, we develop Meta-AHIN, a novel model for COVID-19 themed malicious repository detection in GitHub. In Meta-AHIN, we first construct an attributed heterogeneous information network (AHIN) to model the code content and social coding properties in GitHub; and then we exploit attention-based graph convolutional neural network (AGCN) to learn repository embeddings and present a meta-learning framework for model optimization. To utilize unlabeled information in AHIN and to consider task influence of different types of repositories, we further incorporate node attribute-based self-supervised module and task-aware attention weight into AGCN and meta-learning respectively. Extensive experiments on the collected data from GitHub demonstrate that Meta-AHIN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Graph matching aims at establishing correspondence between node sets of given graphs while keeping the consistency between their edge sets. However, outliers in practical scenarios and equivalent learning of edge representations in deep learning methods are still challenging. To address these issues, we present an Edge Attention-adaptive Graph Matching (EAGM) network and a novel description of edge features. EAGM transforms the matching relation between two graphs into a node and edge classification problem over their assignment graph. To explore the potential of edges, EAGM learns edge attention on the assignment graph to 1) reveal the impact of each edge on graph matching, as well as 2) adjust the learning of edge representations adaptively. To alleviate issues caused by the outliers, we describe an edge by aggregating the semantic information over the space spanned by the edge. Such rich information provides clear distinctions between different edges (e.g., inlier-inlier edges vs. inlier-outlier edges), which further distinguishes outliers in the view of their associated edges. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EAGM achieves promising matching quality compared with state-of-the-arts, on cases both with and without outliers.

These experiments are often performed in a heuristic manner by humans and without any formal reasoning. In this paper, we first describe the key challenges in solving these problems in the framework of Bayesian optimization (BO) and our progress over the last five years in addressing these challenges.

        "abstract": "Protein secondary structure prediction (PSSP) is essential for protein function analysis. However, for low homologous proteins, the PSSP suffers from insufficient input features. In this paper, we explicitly import external self-supervised knowledge for low homologous PSSP under the guidance of residue-wise (amino acid wise) profile fusion. In practice, we firstly demonstrate the superiority of profile over Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) for low homologous PSSP. Based on this observation, we introduce the novel self-supervised BERT features as the pseudo profile, which implicitly involves the residue distribution in all native discovered sequences as the complementary features. Furthermore, a novel residue-wise attention is specially designed to adaptively fuse different features (i.e., original low-quality profile, BERT based pseudo profile), which not only takes full advantage of each feature but also avoids noise disturbance. Besides, the feature consistency loss is proposed to accelerate the model learning from multiple semantic levels. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-arts (i.e., 4.7% for extremely low homologous cases on BC40 dataset).",

        "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) increasingly informs the allocation of opportunities to individuals and communities in areas such as lending, education, employment, and beyond. Such decisions often impact their subjects' future characteristics and capabilities in an a priori unknown fashion. The decision-maker, therefore, faces exploration-exploitation dilemmas akin to those in multi-armed bandits.\r\nFollowing prior work, we model communities as arms. To capture the long-term effects of ML-based allocation decisions, we study a setting in which the reward from each arm evolves every time the decision-maker pulls that arm. We focus on reward functions that are initially increasing in the number of pulls but may become (and remain) decreasing after a certain point. We argue that an acceptable sequential allocation of opportunities must take an arm's potential for growth into account. We capture these considerations through the notion of policy regret, a much stronger notion than the often-studied external regret, and present an algorithm with provably sub-linear policy regret for sufficiently long time horizons. We empirically compare our algorithm with several baselines and find that it consistently outperforms them, in particular for long time horizons.",

However, existing adversarial examples against face recognition systems either lack transferability to black-box models, or fail to be implemented in practice. In this paper, we propose a unified adversarial face generation method - Adv-Makeup, which can realize imperceptible and transferable attack under the black-box setting. Adv-Makeup develops a task-driven makeup generation method with the blending module to synthesize imperceptible eye shadow over the orbital region on faces. And to achieve transferability, Adv-Makeup implements a fine-grained meta-learning based adversarial attack strategy to learn more vulnerable or sensitive features from various models. Compared to existing techniques, sufficient visualization results demonstrate that Adv-Makeup is capable to generate much more imperceptible attacks under both digital and physical scenarios. Meanwhile, extensive quantitative experiments show that Adv-Makeup can significantly improve the attack success rate under black-box setting, even attacking commercial systems.",

        "abstract": "Most existing person re-identification methods are effective in short-term scenarios because of their appearance dependencies. However, these methods may fail in long-term scenarios where people might change their clothes. To this end, we propose an adversarial feature disentanglement network (AFD-Net) which contains intra-class reconstruction and inter-class adversary to disentangle the identity-related and identity-unrelated (clothing) features. For intra-class reconstruction, the person images with the same identity are represented and disentangled into identity and clothing features by two separate encoders, and further reconstructed into original images to reduce intra-class feature variations. For inter-class adversary, the disentangled features across different identities are exchanged and recombined to generate adversarial clothes-changing images for training, which makes the identity and clothing features more independent. Especially, to supervise these new generated clothes-changing images, a re-feeding strategy is designed to re-disentangle and reconstruct these new images for image-level self-supervision in the original image space and feature-level soft-supervision in the disentangled feature space. Moreover, we collect a challenging Market-Clothes dataset and a real-world PKU-Market-Reid dataset for evaluation. The results on one large-scale short-term dataset (Market-1501) and five long-term datasets (three public and two we proposed) confirm the superiority of our method against other state-of-the-art methods.",

Most existing UDA methods learn domain-invariant features by minimizing discrepancy distance computed by a certain metric between domains. However, these discrepancy-based methods cannot be robustly applied to unsupervised time series domain adaptation (UTSDA). That is because discrepancy metrics in these methods contain only low-order and local statistics, which have limited expression for time series distributions and therefore result in failure of domain matching. Actually, the real-world time series are always non-local distributions, i.e., with non-stationary and non-monotonic statistics. In this paper, we propose an Adversarial Spectral Kernel Matching (AdvSKM) method, where a hybrid spectral kernel network is specifically designed as inner kernel to reform the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric for UTSDA. The hybrid spectral kernel network can precisely characterize non-stationary and non-monotonic statistics in time series distributions. Embedding hybrid spectral kernel network to MMD not only guarantees precise discrepancy metric but also benefits domain matching. Besides, the differentiable architecture of the spectral kernel network enables adversarial kernel learning, which brings more discriminatory expression for discrepancy matching. The results of extensive experiments on several real-world UTSDA tasks verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

        "abstract": "The large model size, high computational operations, and vulnerability against membership inference attack (MIA) have impeded deep learning or deep neural networks (DNNs) popularity, especially on mobile devices.  To address the challenge, we envision that the weight pruning technique will help DNNs against MIA while reducing model storage and computational operation. In this work, we propose a pruning algorithm, and we show that the proposed algorithm can find a subnetwork that can prevent privacy leakage from MIA and achieves competitive accuracy with the original DNNs. We also verify our theoretical insights with experiments. Our experimental results illustrate that the attack accuracy using model compression is up to 13.6% and 10% lower than that of the baseline and Min-Max game, accordingly.",

        "abstract": "Age progression and regression aim to synthesize photorealistic appearance of a given face image with aging and rejuvenation effects, respectively. Existing generative adversarial networks (GANs) based methods suffer from the following three major issues: 1) unstable training introducing strong ghost artifacts in the generated faces, 2) unpaired training leading to unexpected changes in facial attributes such as genders and races, and 3) non-bijective age mappings increasing the uncertainty in the face transformation. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel framework, termed AgeFlow, to integrate the advantages of both flow-based models and GANs. The proposed AgeFlow contains three parts: an encoder that maps a given face to a latent space through an invertible neural network, a novel invertible conditional translation module (ICTM) that translates the source latent vector to target one, and a decoder that reconstructs the generated face from the target latent vector using the same encoder network; all parts are invertible achieving bijective age mappings. The novelties of ICTM are two-fold. First, we propose an attribute-aware knowledge distillation to learn the manipulation direction of age progression while keeping other unrelated attributes unchanged, alleviating unexpected changes in facial attributes. Second,  we propose to use GANs in the latent space to ensure the learned latent vector indistinguishable from the real ones, which is much easier than traditional use of GANs in the image domain. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over existing GANs-based methods on two benchmarked datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/AgeFlow.",

For instance, our bounds imply that when the number of groups is constant and the $n$ agents are divided into groups arbitrarily, there exists an allocation that is envy-free up to $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$ goods, and this bound is tight. Moreover, we show that while such an allocation can be found efficiently, it is NP-hard to compute an allocation that is envy-free up to $o(\\sqrt{n})$ goods even when a fully envy-free allocation exists.

However, the non-stationary nature of financial markets makes it very difficult to address the CS-OLPS problem effectively. To address the CS-OLPS problem in non-stationary markets, we propose an effective news-driven method, named CAND, which adaptively exploits news to determine the adjustment tendency and adjustment scale for tracking the dynamic optimal portfolio with minimal CVaR in each trading round. In addition, we devise a filtering mechanism to reduce the errors caused by the noisy news for further improving CAND's effectiveness. We rigorously prove a sub-linear regret of CAND.

        "abstract": "Video data is multimodal in its nature, where an utterance can involve linguistic, visual and acoustic information. Therefore, a key challenge for video sentiment analysis is how to combine different modalities for sentiment recognition effectively. The latest neural network approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance, but they neglect to a large degree of how humans understand and reason about sentiment states. By contrast, recent advances in quantum probabilistic neural models have achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, yet with better transparency and increased level of interpretability. However, the existing quantum-inspired models treat quantum states as either a classical mixture or as a separable tensor product across modalities, without triggering their interactions in a way that they are correlated or non-separable (i.e., entangled). This means that the current models have not fully exploited the expressive power of quantum probabilities. To fill this gap, we propose a transparent quantum probabilistic neural model. The model induces different modalities to interact in such a way that they may not be separable, encoding crossmodal information in the form of non-classical correlations. Comprehensive evaluation on two benchmarking datasets for video sentiment analysis shows that the model achieves significant performance improvement. We also show that the degree of non-separability between modalities optimizes the post-hoc interpretability.",

In this work, we evaluate bias present in deepfake datasets and detection models across protected subgroups. Using facial datasets balanced by race and gender, we examine three popular deepfake detectors and find large disparities in predictive performances across races, with up to 10.7% difference in error rate between subgroups. A closer look reveals that the widely used FaceForensics++ dataset is overwhelmingly composed of Caucasian subjects, with the majority being female Caucasians. Our investigation of the racial distribution of deepfakes reveals that the methods used to create deepfakes as positive training signals tend to produce ``irregular\" faces - when a person\u2019s face is swapped onto another person of a different race or gender. This causes detectors to learn spurious correlations between the foreground faces and fakeness. Moreover, when detectors are trained with the Blended Image (BI) dataset from Face X-Rays, we find that those detectors develop systematic discrimination towards certain racial subgroups, primarily female Asians.",

At one end are (bounded-sub)optimal algorithms that can find high-quality solutions for small problems. At the other end are unbounded-suboptimal algorithms that can solve large problems but usually find low-quality solutions. In this paper, we consider a third approach that combines the best of both worlds: anytime algorithms that quickly find an initial solution using efficient MAPF algorithms from the literature, even for large problems, and that subsequently improve the solution quality to near-optimal as time progresses by replanning subgroups of agents using Large Neighborhood Search. We compare our algorithm MAPF-LNS against a range of existing work and report significant gains in scalability, runtime to the initial solution, and speed of improving the solution.",

First, we derive a novel concentration inequality that is tailored to stratified Shapley value estimation using sample variance information. Second, by sequentially choosing samples to minimize our inequality, we develop a new and more efficient method of sampling to estimate the Shapley value. We evaluate our sampling method on a suite of test cooperative games, and our results demonstrate that it outperforms or is competitive with existing stratified sample-based estimation approaches to computing the Shapley value.",

Among various approaches to XAI, argumentative models have been advocated in both the AI and social science literature, as their dialectical nature appears to match some basic desirable features of the explanation activity. In this survey we overview XAI approaches built using methods from the field of computational argumentation, leveraging its wide array of reasoning abstractions and explanation delivery methods. We overview the literature focusing on different types of explanation (intrinsic and post-hoc), different models with which argumentation-based explanations are deployed, different forms of delivery, and different argumentation frameworks they use.

        "abstract": "Active learning tries to learn an effective model with lowest labeling cost. Most existing active learning methods work in a synchronous way, which implies that the label querying can be performed only after the model updating in each iteration. While training models is usually time-consuming, it may lead to serious latency between two queries, especially in the crowdsourcing environments where there are many online annotators working simultaneously. This will significantly decrease the labeling efficiency and strongly limit the application of active learning in real tasks. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-server multi-worker framework for asynchronous active learning in the distributed environment. By maintaining two shared pools of candidate queries and labeled data respectively, the servers, the workers and the annotators efficiently corporate with each other without synchronization. Moreover, diverse sampling strategies from distributed workers are incorporated to select the most useful instances for model improving. Both theoretical analysis and experimental study validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Existing methods that use graph neural networks to represent multiple granularities such as entities and sentences in documents update all nodes synchronously, ignoring the fact that multi-hop reasoning has a certain logical order across granular levels. In this paper, we introduce an Asynchronous Multi-grained Graph Network (AMGN) for multi-hop MRC. First, we construct a multigrained graph containing entity and sentence nodes. Particularly, we use independent parameters to represent relationship groups defined according to the level of granularity. Second, an asynchronous update mechanism based on multi-grained relationships is proposed to mimic human multi-hop reading logic. Besides, we present a question reformulation mechanism to update the latent representation of the compound question with updated graph nodes. We evaluate the proposed model on the HotpotQA dataset and achieve top competitive performance in distractor setting compared with other published models. Further analysis shows that the asynchronous update mechanism can effectively form interpretable reasoning chains at different granularity levels.",

In this paper, to overcome this shortcoming we present a novel attention-based pyramid dilated lattice (APDL) architecture and investigate its capability for blind image denoising. The proposed framework can effectively harness the advantages of residual and dense aggregations to achieve a great trade-off between performance, parameter efficiency, and test time. It also employs a novel pyramid dilated convolution strategy to effectively capture contextual information corresponding to different noise levels through the training of a single model. Our extensive experimental investigation verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of the APDL architecture for image denoising as well as JPEG artifacts suppression tasks.",

        "abstract": "We propose an audio-driven talking-head method to generate photo-realistic talking-head videos from a single reference image. In this work, we tackle two key challenges: (i) producing natural head motions that match speech prosody, and (ii)} maintaining the appearance of a speaker in a large head motion while stabilizing the non-face regions. We first design a head pose predictor by modeling rigid 6D head movements with a motion-aware recurrent neural network (RNN). In this way, the predicted head poses act as the low-frequency holistic movements of a talking head, thus allowing our latter network to focus on detailed facial movement generation. To depict the entire image motions arising from audio, we exploit a keypoint based dense motion field representation. Then, we develop a motion field generator to produce the dense motion fields from input audio, head poses, and a reference image. As this keypoint based representation models the motions of facial regions, head, and backgrounds integrally, our method can better constrain the spatial and temporal consistency of the generated videos. Finally, an image generation network is employed to render photo-realistic talking-head videos from the estimated keypoint based motion fields and the input reference image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method produces videos with plausible head motions, synchronized facial expressions, and stable backgrounds and outperforms the state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "Recently online multi-armed bandit (MAB) is growing rapidly, as novel problem settings and algorithms motivated by various practical applications are being studied, building on the top of the classic bandit problem. However, identifying the best bandit algorithm from lots of potential candidates for a given application is not only time-consuming but also relying on human expertise, which hinders the practicality of MAB. To alleviate this problem, this paper outlines an intelligent system called AutoBandit, equipped with many out-of-the-box MAB algorithms, for automatically and adaptively choosing the best with suitable hyper-parameters online. It is effective to help a growing application for continuously maximizing cumulative rewards of its whole life-cycle. With a flexible architecture and user-friendly web-based interfaces, it is very convenient for the user to integrate and monitor online bandits in a business system. At the time of publication, AutoBandit has been deployed for various industrial applications.",

        "abstract": "Data-free compression raises a new challenge because the original training dataset for a pre-trained model to be compressed is not available due to privacy or transmission issues. Thus, a common approach is to compute a reconstructed training dataset before compression. The current reconstruction methods compute the reconstructed training dataset with a generator by exploiting information from the pre-trained model. However, current reconstruction methods focus on extracting more information from the pre-trained model but do not leverage network engineering. This work is the first to consider network engineering as an approach to design the reconstruction method. Specifically, we propose the AutoReCon method, which is a neural architecture search-based reconstruction method. In the proposed AutoReCon method, the generator architecture is designed automatically given the pre-trained model for reconstruction. Experimental results show that using generators discovered by the AutoRecon method always improve the performance of data-free compression.",

Here, we survey the available intelligent technologies that can support the human expert in the different steps of her fact-checking endeavor. These include identifying claims worth fact-checking, detecting relevant previously fact-checked claims, retrieving relevant evidence to fact-check a claim, and actually verifying a claim.

However, as the literature on graph learning booms with a vast number of emerging methods and techniques, it becomes increasingly difficult to manually design the optimal machine learning algorithm for different graph-related tasks. To solve this critical challenge, automated machine learning (AutoML) on graphs which combines the strength of graph machine learning and AutoML together, is gaining attention from the research community. Therefore, we comprehensively survey AutoML on graphs in this paper, primarily focusing on hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search (NAS) for graph machine learning. We further overview libraries related to automated graph machine learning and in-depth discuss AutoGL, the first dedicated open-source library for AutoML on graphs. In the end, we share our insights on future research directions for automated graph machine learning.

        "abstract": "Pre-trained language models such as BERT have shown remarkable effectiveness in various natural language processing tasks. However, these models usually contain millions of parameters, which prevent them from the practical deployment on resource-constrained devices. Knowledge distillation, Weight pruning, and Quantization are known to be the main directions in  model compression. However, compact models obtained through knowledge distillation  may suffer from significant accuracy drop even for a relatively small compression ratio. On the other hand, there are only a few attempts based on quantization designed for natural language processing tasks, and they usually require manual setting on hyper-parameters. In this paper, we proposed an automatic mixed-precision quantization framework designed for BERT that can conduct quantization and pruning simultaneously. Specifically, our proposed method leverages Differentiable Neural Architecture Search to assign scale and precision for parameters in each sub-group automatically, and at the same pruning out redundant groups of parameters. Extensive evaluations on BERT downstream tasks reveal that our proposed method beats baselines by providing the same performance with much smaller model size.\r\nWe also show the possibility of obtaining the extremely light-weight model by combining our solution with orthogonal methods such as DistilBERT.",

        "abstract": "Music-to-dance translation is an emerging and powerful feature in recent role-playing games. Previous works of this topic consider music-to-dance as a supervised motion generation problem based on time-series data. However, these methods require a large amount of training data pairs and may suffer from the degradation of movements. This paper provides a new solution to this task where we re-formulate the translation as a piece-wise dance phrase retrieval problem based on the choreography theory. With such a design, players are allowed to optionally edit the dance movements on top of our generation while other regression-based methods ignore such user interactivity. Considering that the dance motion capture is expensive that requires the assistance of professional dancers, we train our method under a semi-supervised learning fashion with a large unlabeled music dataset (20x than our labeled one) and also introduce self-supervised pre-training to improve the training stability and generalization performance. Experimental results suggest that our method not only generalizes well over various styles of music but also succeeds in choreography for game players.

Although the discounted criterion is appropriate for certain tasks such as financial related problems, many engineering problems treat future rewards equally and prefer a long-run average criterion. In this paper, we study the reinforcement learning problem with the long-run average criterion. Firstly, we develop a unified trust region theory with discounted and average criteria. With the average criterion, a novel performance bound within the trust region is derived with the Perturbation Analysis (PA) theory. Secondly, we propose a practical algorithm named Average Policy Optimization (APO), which improves the value estimation with a novel technique named Average Value Constraint. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one to study the trust region approach with the average criterion and it complements the framework of reinforcement learning beyond the discounted criterion. Finally, experiments are conducted in the continuous control environment MuJoCo. In most tasks, APO performs better than the discounted PPO, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.",

However, the existing attacks require the ability to arbitrarily modify an agent's observation, constraining the application scope to simple RL systems such as Atari games. In this paper, we migrate backdoor attacks to more complex RL systems involving multiple agents and explore the possibility of triggering the backdoor without directly manipulating the agent's observation. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that an adversary agent can trigger the backdoor of the victim agent with its own action in two-player competitive RL systems. We prototype and evaluate BackdooRL in four competitive environments. The results show that when the backdoor is activated, the winning rate of the victim drops by 17% to 37% compared to when not activated.

        "abstract": "Different to traditional on-premise VDI , the virtual desktops in DaaS (Desktop as a Service) are hosted in public cloud where virtual machines are charged based on usage. Accordingly, an adaptive power management system which can turn off spare virtual machines without sacrificing end user experience is of significant customer value as it can greatly help reduce the running cost. Generally, logon behavior modeling for VDI users serves as the key enabling-technique to fulfill intelligent power management. Prior attempts work by modeling logon behavior in a user-dependent manner with tailored single-instance feature representation, where the strong relationships among pool-sharing VDI users are ignored in the modeling framework. In this paper, a novel formulation towards VDI user logon behavior modeling is proposed by employing the multi-instance multi-label (MIML) techniques. Specifically, each user is grouped with supporting users whose behaviors are jointly modeled in the feature space with multi-instance representation as well as in the output space with multi-label prediction. The resulting MIML formulation is optimized by adapting the popular MIML boosting procedure via balanced error-rate minimization. Experimental studies on real VDI customers' data clearly validate the effectiveness of the proposed MIML-based approach against state-of-the-art VDI user logon behavior modeling techniques.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are known immensely brittle towards text adversarial examples. Recent attack algorithms usually adopt word-level substitution strategies following a pre-computed word replacement mechanism. However, their resultant adversarial examples are still imperfect in achieving grammar correctness and semantic similarities, which is largely because of their unsuitable candidate word selections and static optimization methods. In this research, we propose BESA, a BERT-based Simulated Annealing algorithm,  to address these two problems. Firstly, we leverage the BERT Masked Language Model (MLM) to generate contextual-aware candidate words to produce fluent adversarial text and avoid grammar errors. Secondly, we employ Simulated Annealing (SA) to adaptively determine the word substitution order. The SA provides sufficient word replacement options via internal simulations, with an objective to obtain both a high attack success rate and a low word substitution rate.  Besides, our algorithm is able to jump out of local optima with a controlled probability, making it closer to achieve the best possible attack (i.e., the global optima). Experiments on five popular datasets manifest the superiority of BESA compared with existing methods, including TextFooler, BAE, BERT-Attack, PWWS, and PSO.",

Without an accurate model, sample problems or tasks must be selected haphazardly by the tutor. Once an accurate model has been trained, the tutor can selectively focus on training essential or deficient skills. Prior work offers mechanisms for optimizing the training of a single skill or for multiple skills when individual tasks involve testing only a single skill at a time, but not for multiple skills when individual tasks can contain evidence for multiple skills. In this paper, we present a system that estimates user skill models for multiple skills by selecting tasks which maximize the information gain across the entire skill model. We compare our system's policy against several baselines and an optimal policy in both simulated and real tasks. Our system outperforms baselines and performs almost on par with the optimal policy.",

CAT methods adaptively select the next most informative question/item for each student given their responses to previous questions, effectively reducing test length. Existing CAT methods use item response theory (IRT) models to relate student ability to their responses to questions and static question selection algorithms designed to reduce the ability estimation error as quickly as possible; therefore, these algorithms cannot improve by learning from large-scale student response data. In this paper, we propose BOBCAT, a Bilevel Optimization-Based framework for CAT to directly learn a data-driven question selection algorithm from training data. BOBCAT is agnostic to the underlying student response model and is computationally efficient during the adaptive testing process. Through extensive experiments on five real-world student response datasets, we show that BOBCAT outperforms existing CAT methods (sometimes significantly) at reducing test length.",

Like backdoor sets and backdoor trees, backdoor DNFs are defined relative to a tractable class of CNF formulas. Each conjunctive term of a backdoor DNF defines a partial assignment that moves the input CNF formula into the base class.  Backdoor DNFs are more expressive and potentially smaller than their predecessors backdoor sets and backdoor trees.  We establish the fixed-parameter tractability of the backdoor DNF detection problem.  Our results hold for the fundamental base classes Horn and 2CNF, and their combination. We complement our theoretical findings by an empirical study. Our experiments show that backdoor DNFs provide a significant improvement over their predecessors.",

        "abstract": "Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) is a powerful approach for incorporating advice from experts in the form of demonstrations. However, demonstrations often come from multiple sub-optimal experts with conflicting goals, rendering them difficult to incorporate effectively in online settings. To address this, we formulate a quadratic program whose solution yields an adaptive weighting over experts, that can be used to sample experts with relevant goals. In order to compare different source and target task goals safely, we model their uncertainty using normal-inverse-gamma priors, whose posteriors are learned from demonstrations using Bayesian neural networks with a shared encoder. Our resulting approach, which we call Bayesian Experience Reuse, can be applied for LfD in static and dynamic decision-making settings. We demonstrate its effectiveness for minimizing multi-modal functions, and optimizing a high-dimensional supply chain with cost uncertainty, where it is also shown to improve upon the performance of the demonstrators' policies.",

As a result of statistical heterogeneity, recent studies clearly show that the performance of popular FL methods (e.g., FedAvg) deteriorates dramatically due to the client drift caused by local updates. This paper proposes a novel Federated Learning algorithm (called IGFL), which leverages both Individual and Group behaviors to mimic distribution, thereby improving the ability to deal with heterogeneity.  Unlike existing FL methods, our IGFL can be applied to both client and server optimization. As a by-product, we propose a new attention-based federated learning in the server optimization of IGFL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to incorporate attention\r\nmechanisms into federated optimization. We conduct extensive experiments and show that IGFL can significantly improve the performance of existing federated learning methods. Especially when the distributions of data among individuals are diverse, IGFL can improve the classification accuracy by about 13% compared with prior baselines.",

CheckList includes a matrix of general linguistic capabilities and test types that facilitate comprehensive test ideation, as well as a software tool to generate a large and diverse number of test cases quickly. We illustrate the utility of CheckList with tests for three tasks, identifying critical failures in both commercial and state-of-art models. In a user study, a team responsible for a commercial sentiment analysis model found new and actionable bugs in an extensively tested model. In another user study, NLP practitioners with CheckList created twice as many tests, and found almost three times as many bugs as users without it.",

        "abstract": "The rapid advances in deep generative models over the past years have led to highly realistic media, known as deepfakes, that are commonly indistinguishable from real to human eyes. These advances make assessing the authenticity of visual data increasingly difficult and pose a misinformation threat to the trustworthiness of visual content in general. Although recent work has shown strong detection accuracy of such deepfakes, the success largely relies on identifying frequency artifacts in the generated images, which will not yield a sustainable detection approach as generative models continue evolving and closing the gap to real images. In order to overcome this issue, we propose a novel fake detection that is designed to re-synthesize testing images and extract visual cues for detection. The re-synthesis procedure is flexible, allowing us to incorporate a series of visual tasks - we adopt super-resolution, denoising and colorization as the re-synthesis. We demonstrate the improved effectiveness, cross-GAN generalization, and robustness against perturbations of our approach in a variety of detection scenarios involving multiple generators over CelebA-HQ, FFHQ, and LSUN datasets.

        "abstract": "Word embedding models reflect bias towards genders, ethnicities, and other social groups present in the underlying training data. Metrics such as ECT, RNSB, and WEAT quantify bias in these models based on predefined word lists representing social groups and bias-conveying concepts. How suitable these lists actually are to reveal bias - let alone the bias metrics in general - remains unclear, though. In this paper, we study how to assess the quality of bias metrics for word embedding models. In particular, we present a generic method, Bias Silhouette Analysis (BSA), that quantifies the accuracy and robustness of such a metric and of the word lists used. Given a biased and an unbiased reference embedding model, BSA applies the metric systematically for several subsets of the lists to the models. The variance and rate of convergence of the bias values of each model then entail the robustness of the word lists, whereas the distance between the models' values gives indications of the general accuracy of the metric with the word lists. We demonstrate the behavior of BSA on two standard embedding models for the three mentioned metrics with several word lists from existing research.",

        "abstract": "For crowd counting task, it has been demonstrated that imposing Gaussians to point annotations hurts generalization performance. Several methods attempt to utilize point annotations as supervision directly. And they have made significant improvement compared with density-map based methods. However, these point based methods ignore the inevitable annotation noises and still suffer from low robustness to noisy annotations. To address the problem, we propose a bipartite matching based method for crowd counting with only point supervision (BM-Count). In BM-Count, we select a subset of most similar pixels from the predicted density map to match annotated pixels via bipartite matching. Then loss functions can be defined based on the matching pairs to alleviate the bad effect caused by those annotated dots with incorrect positions. Under the noisy annotations, our method reduces MAE and RMSE by 9% and 11.2% respectively. Moreover, we propose a novel ranking distribution learning framework to address the imbalanced distribution problem of head counts, which encodes the head counts as classification distribution in the ranking domain and refines the estimated count map in the continuous domain. Extensive experiments on four datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and performs better crowd localization.",

        "abstract": "The exponential increase in computation and memory complexity with the depth of network has become the main impediment to the successful application of graph neural networks (GNNs) on large-scale graphs like graphs with hundreds of millions of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel neighbor sampling strategy, dubbed blocking-based neighbor sampling (BNS), for efficient training of GNNs on large-scale graphs. Specifically, BNS adopts a policy to stochastically block the ongoing expansion of neighboring nodes, which can reduce the rate of the exponential increase in computation and memory complexity of GNNs. Furthermore, a reweighted policy is applied to graph convolution, to adjust the contribution of blocked and non-blocked neighbors to central nodes. We theoretically prove that BNS provides an unbiased estimation for the original graph convolution operation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that, on large-scale graphs, BNS is 2X~5X faster than state-of-the-art methods when achieving the same accuracy. Moreover, even on the small-scale graphs, BNS also demonstrates the advantage of low time cost.",

While most research focuses on the state-action function part through reducing the bootstrapping error in value function approximation induced by the distribution shift of training data, the effects of error propagation in generative modeling have been neglected. In this paper, we analyze the error in generative modeling. We propose AQL (action-conditioned Q-learning), a residual generative model to reduce policy approximation error for offline RL. We show that our method can learn more accurate policy approximations in different benchmark datasets. In addition, we show that the proposed offline RL method can learn more competitive AI agents in complex control tasks under the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, Honor of Kings.",

        "abstract": "Variational Inference makes a trade-off between the capacity of the variational family and the tractability of finding an approximate posterior distribution. Instead, Boosting Variational Inference allows practitioners to obtain increasingly good posterior approximations by spending more compute. The main obstacle to widespread adoption of Boosting Variational Inference is the amount of resources necessary to improve over a strong Variational Inference baseline. In our work, we trace this limitation back to the global curvature of the KL-divergence. We characterize how the global curvature impacts time and memory consumption, address the problem with the notion of local curvature, and provide a novel approximate backtracking algorithm for estimating local curvature. We give new theoretical convergence rates for our algorithms and provide experimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets.",

A first step to automatize drawing generation is to extract the semantics of the point cloud. Towards this goal, we investigate the use of deep learning to semantically segment oil and gas industrial scenes. We focus on domain characteristics such as high variation of object size, increased concavity and lack of annotated data, which hampers the use of conventional approaches. To address these issues, we advocate the use of synthetic data, adaptive downsampling and context sharing.",

        "abstract": "Given a reference object of an unknown type in an image, human observers can effortlessly find the objects of the same category  in another image and precisely tell their visual boundaries. Such visual cognition capability of humans seems absent from the current research spectrum of computer vision. Existing segmentation networks, for example, rely on a humongous amount of labeled data, which is laborious and costly to collect and annotate; besides, the performance of segmentation networks tend to downgrade as the number of the category increases. In this paper, we introduce a novel Reference semantic segmentation Network (Ref-Net) to conduct visual boundary knowledge translation. Ref-Net contains a Reference Segmentation Module (RSM) and a Boundary Knowledge Translation Module (BKTM). Inspired by the human recognition mechanism, RSM is devised only to segment the same category objects based on the features of the reference objects. BKTM, on the other hand, introduces two boundary discriminator branches to conduct inner and outer boundary segmentation of the target object in an adversarial manner, and translate the annotated boundary knowledge of open-source datasets into the segmentation network. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that, with tens of finely-grained annotated samples as guidance, Ref-Net achieves results on par with fully supervised methods on six datasets.

        "abstract": "Many planning problems are too hard to solve optimally.  In bounded-cost search, one attempts to find, as quickly as possible, a plan that costs no more than a user-provided absolute cost bound.  Several algorithms have been previously proposed for this setting, including Potential Search (PTS) and Bounded-cost Explicit Estimation Search (BEES).  BEES attempts to improve on PTS by predicting whether nodes will lead to plans within the cost bound or not.  This paper introduces a relatively simple algorithm, Expected Effort Search (XES), which uses not just point estimates but belief distributions in order to estimate the probability that a node will lead to a plan within the bound.  XES's expansion order minimizes expected search time in a simplified formal model.  Experimental results on standard planning and search benchmarks show that it consistently exhibits strong performance, outperforming both PTS and BEES.  We also derive improved variants of BEES that can exploit belief distributions.  These new methods advance the recent trend of taking advantage of uncertainty estimates in deterministic single-agent search.",

        "abstract": "The Nash social welfare (NSW) is a well-known social welfare measurement that balances individual utilities and the overall efficiency. In the context of fair allocation of indivisible goods, it has been shown by Caragiannis et al. (EC 2016 and TEAC 2019) that an allocation maximizing the NSW is envy-free up to one good (EF1). In this paper, we are interested in the fairness of the NSW in a budget-feasible allocation problem, in which each item has a cost that will be incurred to the agent it is allocated to, and each agent has a budget constraint on the total cost of items she receives. We show that a budget-feasible allocation that maximizes the NSW achieves a 1/4-approximation of EF1 and the approximation ratio is tight. The approximation ratio improves gracefully when the items have small costs compared with the agents' budgets; it converges to 1/2 when the budget-cost ratio approaches infinity.",

Depending on agents' membership in the groups, we consider two main models: single group setting where each agent belongs to only one group, and multiple group setting where each agent may belong to multiple groups. We propose novel budget-feasible proportion-representative mechanisms for these models, which can select representative agents from different groups.  The proposed mechanisms guarantee theoretical properties of individual rationality, budget-feasibility, truthfulness, and approximation performance on proportional representation.",

While the significance of the affordance concept has been previously studied from varied perspectives, such as psychology and cognitive science, these approaches are not always sufficient to enable direct transfer, in the sense of implementations, to artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems and robotics. However, many efforts have been made to pragmatically employ the concept of affordances, as it represents great potential for AI agents to effectively bridge perception to action. In this survey, we review and find common ground amongst different strategies that use the concept of affordances within robotic tasks, and build on these methods to provide guidance for including affordances as a mechanism to improve autonomy. To this end, we outline common design choices for building representations of affordance relations, and their implications on the generalisation capabilities of an agent when facing previously unseen scenarios. Finally, we identify and discuss a range of interesting research directions involving affordances that have the potential to improve the capabilities of an AI agent.",

        "abstract": "In many real-world scenarios, a team of agents must coordinate with each other to compete against an opponent. The challenge of solving this type of game is that the team's joint action space grows exponentially with the number of agents, which results in the inefficiency of the existing algorithms, e.g., Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR). To address this problem, we propose a new framework of CFR: CFR-MIX. Firstly, we propose a new strategy representation that represents a joint action strategy using individual strategies of all agents and a consistency relationship to maintain the cooperation between agents. To compute the equilibrium with individual strategies under the CFR framework, we transform the consistency relationship between strategies to the consistency relationship between the cumulative regret values. Furthermore, we propose a novel decomposition method over cumulative regret values to guarantee the consistency relationship between the cumulative regret values. Finally, we introduce our new algorithm CFR-MIX which employs a mixing layer to estimate cumulative regret values of joint actions as a non-linear combination of cumulative regret values of individual actions. Experimental results show that CFR-MIX outperforms existing algorithms on various games significantly.",

        "abstract": "Recently, hashing is widely used in approximate nearest neighbor search for its storage and computational efficiency. Most of the unsupervised hashing methods learn to map images into semantic similarity-preserving hash codes by constructing local semantic similarity structure from the pre-trained model as the guiding information, i.e., treating each point pair similar if their distance is small in feature space. However, due to the inefficient representation ability of the pre-trained model, many false positives and negatives in local semantic similarity will be introduced and lead to error propagation during the hash code learning. Moreover, few of the methods consider the robustness of models, which will cause instability of hash codes to disturbance. In this paper, we propose a new method named  Comprehensive sImilarity Mining and cOnsistency learNing (CIMON). First, we use global refinement and similarity statistical distribution to obtain reliable and smooth guidance. Second, both semantic and contrastive consistency learning are introduced to derive both disturb-invariant and discriminative hash codes. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art methods in both retrieval performance and robustness.",

        "abstract": "Molecular interactions are significant resources for analyzing sophisticated biological systems. Identification of multifarious molecular interactions attracts increasing attention in biomedicine, bioinformatics, and human healthcare communities. Recently, a plethora of methods have been proposed to reveal molecular interactions in one specific domain. However, existing methods heavily rely on features or structures involving molecules, which limits the capacity of transferring the models to other tasks. Therefore, generalized models for the multifarious molecular interaction prediction (MIP) are in demand. In this paper, we propose a contrastive self-supervised graph neural network (CSGNN) to predict molecular interactions. CSGNN injects a mix-hop neighborhood aggregator into a graph neural network (GNN) to capture high-order dependency in the molecular interaction networks and leverages a contrastive self-supervised learning task as a regularizer within a multi-task learning paradigm to enhance the generalization ability. Experiments on seven molecular interaction networks show that CSGNN outperforms classic and state-of-the-art models. Comprehensive experiments indicate that the mix-hop aggregator and the self-supervised regularizer can effectively facilitate the link inference in multifarious molecular networks.",

        "abstract": "Ontology-mediated query answering (OMQA) employs structured knowledge and automated reasoning in order to facilitate access to incomplete and possibly heterogeneous data. While most research on OMQA adopts (unions of) conjunctive queries as the query language, there has been recent interest in handling queries that involve counting. In this paper, we advance this line of research by investigating cardinality queries (which correspond to Boolean atomic counting queries) coupled with DL-Lite ontologies. Despite its apparent simplicity, we show that such an OMQA setting gives rise to rich and complex behaviour. While we prove that cardinality query answering is tractable (TC0) in data complexity when the ontology is formulated in DL-Lite-core, the problem becomes coNP-hard as soon as role inclusions are allowed. For DL-Lite-pos-H (which allows only positive axioms), we establish a P-coNP dichotomy and pinpoint the TC0 cases; for DL-Lite-core-H (allowing also negative axioms), we identify new sources of coNP complexity and also exhibit L-complete cases. Interestingly, and in contrast to related tractability results, we observe that the canonical model may not give the optimal count value in the tractable cases, which led us to develop an entirely new approach based upon exploring a space of strategies to determine the minimum possible number of query matches.",

The model enriches the causal representation for multi-domain data. We propose an integrated two-phase algorithm to estimate the model. In particular, we first locate the latent factors and estimate the factor loading matrix. Then to uncover the causal structure among shared latent factors of interest, we derive a score function based on the characterization of independence relations between external influences and the dependence relations between multi-domain latent factors and latent factors of interest. We show that the proposed method provides locally consistent estimators. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning is revolutionizing predictive healthcare, including recommending medications to patients with complex health conditions. Existing approaches focus on predicting all medications for the current visit, which often overlaps with medications from previous visits. A more clinically relevant task is to identify medication changes.\r\nIn this paper, we propose a new recurrent residual networks, named MICRON, for medication change prediction. MICRON takes the changes in patient health records as input and learns to update a hid- den medication vector and the medication set recurrently with a reconstruction design. The medication vector is like the memory cell that encodes longitudinal information of medications. Unlike traditional methods that require the entire patient history for prediction, MICRON has a residual-based inference that allows for sequential updating based only on new patient features (e.g., new diagnoses in the recent visit), which is efficient.\r\nWe evaluated MICRON on real inpatient and outpatient datasets. MICRON achieves 3.5% and 7.8% relative improvements over the best baseline in F1 score, respectively. MICRON also requires fewer parameters, which significantly reduces the training time to 38.3s per epoch with 1.5\u00d7 speed-up.",

Such human integration allows to incorporate previously unknown constraints, and is also an integral part of automated modeling assistance. As a foundation for integrating user requests, we study the computational complexity of determining the existence of changes to an existing model, such that the resulting model allows for specific user-provided solutions. We are provided with a planning problem modeled either in the classical (non-hierarchical) or hierarchical task network (HTN) planning formalism, as well as with a supposed-to-be solution plan, which is actually not a solution for the current model. Considering changing decomposition methods as well as preconditions and effects of actions, we show that most change requests are NP-complete though some turn out to be tractable.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes Characteristic Examples for effectively fingerprinting deep neural networks, featuring high-robustness to the base model against model pruning as well as low-transferability to unassociated models. This is the first work taking both robustness and transferability into consideration for generating realistic fingerprints, whereas current methods lack practical assumptions and may incur large false positive rates. To achieve better trade-off between robustness and transferability, we propose three kinds of characteristic examples: vanilla C-examples, RC-examples, and LTRC-example, to derive fingerprints from the original base model. To fairly characterize the trade-off between robustness and transferability, we propose Uniqueness Score, a comprehensive metric that measures the difference between robustness and transferability, which also serves as an indicator to the false alarm problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed characteristic examples can achieve superior performance when compared with existing fingerprinting methods. In particular, for VGG ImageNet models, using LTRC-examples gives 4X higher uniqueness score than the baseline method and does not incur any false positives.",

So far, analyses of these logics need to be done on a case-by-case basis, albeit they share several common features. This calls for a more general choice logic framework, with QCL and CCL as well as some of their derivatives being particular instantiations. We provide such a framework, which allows us, on the one hand, to easily define new choice logics and, on the other hand, to examine properties of different choice logics in a uniform setting. In particular, we investigate strong equivalence, a core concept in non-classical logics for understanding formula simplification, and computational complexity. Our analysis also yields new results for QCL and CCL. For example, we show that the main reasoning task regarding preferred models is \u03f4\u2082P-complete for QCL and CCL, while being \u0394\u2082P-complete for a newly introduced choice logic.",

        "abstract": "Choosing a suitable algorithm from the myriads of different search heuristics is difficult when faced with a novel optimization problem. In this work, we argue that the purely academic question of what could be the best possible algorithm in a certain broad class of black-box optimizers can give fruitful indications in which direction to search for good established optimization heuristics. We demonstrate this approach on the recently proposed DLB benchmark, for which the only known results are O(n^3) runtimes for several classic evolutionary algorithms and an O(n^2 log n) runtime for an estimation-of-distribution algorithm. Our finding that the unary unbiased black-box complexity is only O(n^2) suggests the Metropolis algorithm as an interesting candidate and we prove that it solves the DLB problem in quadratic time. Since we also prove that better runtimes cannot be obtained in the class of unary unbiased algorithms, we shift our attention to algorithms that use the information of more parents to generate new solutions. An artificial algorithm of this type having an O(n log n) runtime leads to the result that the significance-based compact genetic algorithm (sig-cGA) can solve the DLB problem also in time O(n log n). Our experiments show a remarkably good performance of the Metropolis algorithm, clearly the best of all algorithms regarded for reasonable problem sizes.",

        "abstract": "Vision-and-Language (VL) pre-training has shown great potential on many related downstream tasks, such as Visual Question Answering (VQA), one of the most popular problems in the VL field. All of these pre-trained models (such as VisualBERT, ViLBERT, LXMERT and UNITER) are built with Transformer, which extends the classical attention mechanism to multiple layers and heads. To investigate why and how these models work on VQA so well, in this paper we explore the roles of individual heads and layers in Transformer models when handling 12 different types of questions. Specifically, we manually remove (chop) heads (or layers) from a pre-trained VisualBERT model at a time, and test it on different levels of questions to record its performance. As shown in the interesting echelon shape of the result matrices, experiments reveal different heads and layers are responsible for different question types, with higher-level layers activated by higher-level visual reasoning questions. Based on this observation, we design a dynamic chopping module that can automatically remove heads and layers of the VisualBERT at an instance level when dealing with different questions. Our dynamic chopping module can effectively reduce the parameters of the original model by 50%, while only damaging the accuracy by less than 1% on the VQA task.",

        "abstract": "Nonlinear regression, although widely used in engineering, financial and security applications for automated decision making, is known to be vulnerable to training data poisoning. Targeted poisoning attacks may cause learning algorithms to fit decision functions with poor predictive performance. This paper presents a new analysis of local intrinsic dimensionality (LID) of nonlinear regression under such poisoning attacks within a Stackelberg game, leading to a practical defense. After adapting a gradient-based attack on linear regression that significantly impairs prediction capabilities to nonlinear settings, we consider a multi-step unsupervised black-box defense. The first step identifies samples that have the greatest influence on the learner's validation error; we then use the theory of local intrinsic dimensionality, which reveals the degree of being an outlier of data samples, to iteratively identify poisoned samples via a generative probabilistic model, and suppress their influence on the prediction function. Empirical validation demonstrates superior performance compared to a range of recent defenses.",

This paper proposes a Clustering-induced Adaptive Structure Enhancing Network (CASEN) for incomplete multi-view clustering, which is an end-to-end trainable framework that jointly conducts multi-view structure enhancing and data clustering. Our method adopts multi-view autoencoder to infer the missing features of the incomplete samples. Then, we perform adaptive graph learning and graph convolution on the reconstructed complete multi-view data to effectively extract data structure. Moreover, we use multiple kernel clustering to integrate the global and local structure for clustering, and the clustering results in turn are used to enhance the data structure. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can comprehensively obtain the structure of incomplete multi-view data and achieve superior performance compared to the other methods.",

However,  the  performance  of  Scene  Graph  Generation  (SGG)  is  unsatisfactory  when  faced  with biased data in real-world scenarios.  Conventional debiasing  research  mainly  studies  from  the  view of balancing data distribution or learning unbiased models  and  representations,  ignoring  the  correlations among the biased classes. In this work, we analyze this problem from a novel cognition perspective:  automatically  building  a  hierarchical  cognitive structure from the biased predictions and navigating  that  hierarchy  to  locate  the  relationships, making  the  tail  relationships  receive  more  attention in a coarse-to-fine mode.  To this end, we propose a novel debiasing Cognition Tree (CogTree) loss  for  unbiased  SGG.  We  first  build  a  cognitive structure CogTree to organize the relationships based  on  the  prediction  of  a  biased  SGG  model. The CogTree distinguishes remarkably different relationships  at  first  and  then  focuses  on  a  small portion  of  easily  confused  ones.   Then,  we  propose  a  debiasing  loss  specially  for  this  cognitive structure, which supports coarse-to-fine distinction for  the  correct  relationships.   The  loss  is  model-agnostic and consistently boosting the performance of  several  state-of-the-art  models.

To address these issues, we propose a collaborative graph learning model to explore patient-disease interactions and medical domain knowledge. Our solution is able to capture structural features of both patients and diseases. The proposed model also utilizes unstructured text data by employing an attention manipulating strategy and then integrates attentive text features into a sequential learning process. We conduct extensive experiments on two important healthcare problems to show the competitive prediction performance of the proposed method compared with various state-of-the-art models. We also confirm the effectiveness of learned representations and model interpretability by a set of ablation and case studies.",

Until recently, its methods have mostly focused on solving problem instances in isolation, ignoring the fact that they often stem from related data distributions in practice. However, recent years have seen a surge of interest in using machine learning, especially graph neural networks, as a key building block for combinatorial tasks, either directly as solvers or by enhancing the former. This paper presents a conceptual review of recent key advancements in this emerging field, aiming at researchers in both optimization and machine learning.",

        "abstract": "AlphaZero has achieved superhuman performance on various perfect-information games, such as chess, shogi and Go. However, directly applying AlphaZero to imperfect-information games (IIG) is infeasible, due to the fact that traditional MCTS methods cannot handle missing information of other players. Meanwhile, there have been several extensions of MCTS for IIGs, by implicitly or explicitly sampling a state of other players. But, due to the inability to handle private and public information well, the performance of these methods is not satisfactory. In this paper, we extend AlphaZero to multiplayer IIGs by developing a new MCTS method, Action-Prediction MCTS (AP-MCTS). In contrast to traditional MCTS extensions for IIGs, AP-MCTS first builds the search tree based on public information, adopts the policy-value network to generalize between hidden states, and finally predicts other players' actions directly. This design bypasses the inefficiency of sampling and the difficulty of predicting the state of other players.  We conduct extensive experiments on the popular 3-player poker game DouDiZhu to evaluate the performance of AP-MCTS combined with the framework AlphaZero. When playing against experienced human players, AP-MCTS achieved a 65.65\\% winning rate, which is almost twice the human's winning rate. When comparing with state-of-the-art DouDiZhu AIs, the Elo rating of AP-MCTS is 50 to 200 higher than them. The ablation study shows that accurate action prediction is the key to AP-MCTS winning.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD), transferring knowledge from a cumbersome teacher model to a lightweight student model, has been investigated to design efficient neural architectures. Generally, the objective function of KD is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss between the softened probability distributions of the teacher model and the student model with the temperature scaling hyperparameter \u03c4. Despite its widespread use, few studies have discussed how such softening influences generalization. Here, we theoretically show that the KL divergence loss focuses on the logit matching when \u03c4 increases and the label matching when \u03c4 goes to 0 and empirically show that the logit matching is positively correlated to performance improvement in general. From this observation, we consider an intuitive KD loss function, the mean squared error (MSE) between the logit vectors, so that the student model can directly learn the logit of the teacher model. The MSE loss outperforms the KL divergence loss, explained by the penultimate layer representations difference between the two losses. Furthermore, we show that sequential distillation can improve performance and that KD, using the KL divergence loss with small \u03c4 particularly, mitigates the label noise. The code to reproduce the experiments is publicly available online at https://github.com/jhoon-oh/kd_data/.",

        "abstract": "Semantics based on weak admissibility were recently introduced to overcome a problem with self-defeating arguments that has not been solved for more than 25 years. The recursive definition of weak admissibility mainly relies on the notion of a reduct regarding a set E which only contains arguments which are neither in E, nor attacked by E. At first glance the reduct seems to be tailored for the weaker versions of Dung-style semantics only. In this paper we show that standard Dung semantics can be naturally reformulated using the reduct revealing that this concept is already implicit. We further identify a new abstract principle for semantics, so-called modularization describing how to obtain further extensions given an initial one. Its importance for the study of abstract argumentation semantics is shown by its ability to alternatively characterize classical and non-classical semantics.",

The framework is highly flexible in that it can be constructed incrementally with new knowledge, and it also supports batch reasoning in certain cases. In the experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of CNLP in discriminative tasks and generative tasks.",

        "abstract": "How to learn a transferable feature representation from limited examples is a key challenge for few-shot classification. Self-supervision as an auxiliary task to the main supervised few-shot task is considered to be a conceivable way to solve the problem since self-supervision can provide additional structural information easily ignored by the main task. However, learning a good representation by traditional self-supervised methods is usually dependent on large training samples. In few-shot scenarios, due to the lack of sufficient samples, these self-supervised methods might learn a biased representation, which more likely leads to the wrong guidance for the main tasks and finally causes the performance degradation. In this paper, we propose conditional self-supervised learning (CSS) to use auxiliary information to guide the representation learning of self-supervised tasks. Specifically, CSS leverages supervised information as prior knowledge to shape and improve the learning feature manifold of self-supervision without auxiliary unlabeled data, so as to reduce representation bias and mine more effective semantic information. Moreover, CSS exploits more meaningful information through supervised and the improved self-supervised learning respectively and integrates the information into a unified distribution, which can further enrich and broaden the original representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method without any fine-tuning can achieve a significant accuracy improvement on the few-shot classification scenarios compared to the state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods.",

There exist utterance, topic and relation discrepancy mainly due to multi-speakers, utterances, and relations. In this paper, we propose a consistent learning and inference method to minimize possible contradictions from those distinctions. First, we design mask mechanisms to refine utterance-aware and speaker-aware representations respectively from the global dialogue representation for the utterance distinction. Then a gate mechanism is proposed to aggregate such bi-grained representations. Next, mutual attention mechanism is introduced to obtain the entity representation for various relation specific topic structures. Finally, the relational inference is performed through first order logic constraints over the labeled data to decrease logically contradictory predicted relations. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that the F1 performance improvement of the proposed method is at least 3.3% compared with SOTA.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in image inpainting have shown impressive results for generating plausible visual details on rather simple backgrounds. However, for complex scenes, it is still challenging to restore reasonable contents as the contextual information within the missing regions tends to be ambiguous. To tackle this problem, we introduce pretext tasks that are semantically meaningful to estimating the missing contents. In particular, we perform knowledge distillation on pretext models and adapt the features to image inpainting. The learned semantic priors ought to be partially invariant between the high-level pretext task and low-level image inpainting, which not only help to understand the global context but also provide structural guidance for the restoration of local textures. Based on the semantic priors, we further propose a context-aware image inpainting model, which adaptively integrates global semantics and local features in a unified image generator. The semantic learner and the image generator are trained in an end-to-end manner. We name the model SPL to highlight its ability to learn and leverage semantic priors. It achieves the state of the art on Places2, CelebA, and Paris StreetView datasets",

In addition, the appearance of camouflaged objects varies significantly, e.g., object size and shape, aggravating the difficulties of accurate COD. In this paper, we propose a novel Context-aware Crosslevel Fusion Network (C2F-Net) to address the challenging COD task. Specifically, we propose an Attention-induced Cross-level Fusion Module (ACFM) to integrate the multi-level features with\r\ninformative attention coefficients. The fused features are then fed to the proposed Dual-branch Global Context Module (DGCM), which yields multi-scale feature representations for exploiting rich global context information. In C2F-Net, the two modules are conducted on high-level features using a cascaded manner. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our C2F-Net is an effective COD model and outperforms state-of-the-art models remarkably.

        "abstract": "Many decision-making processes involve solving a combinatorial optimization problem with uncertain input that can be estimated from historic data. Recently, problems in this class have been successfully addressed via end-to-end learning approaches, which rely on solving one optimization problem for each training instance at every epoch. In this context, we provide two distinct contributions. First, we use a Noise Contrastive approach to motivate a family of surrogate loss functions, based on viewing non-optimal solutions as negative examples. Second, we address a major bottleneck of all predict-and-optimize approaches, i.e. the need to frequently recompute optimal solutions at training time. This is done via a solver-agnostic solution caching scheme, and by replacing optimization calls with a lookup in the solution cache. The method is formally based on an inner approximation of the feasible space and, combined with a cache lookup strategy, provides a controllable trade-off between training time and accuracy of the loss approximation. We empirically show that even a very slow growth rate is enough to match the quality of state-of-the-art methods, at a fraction of the computational cost.",

        "abstract": "Model inversion, whose goal is to recover training data from a pre-trained model, has been recently proved feasible. However, existing inversion methods usually suffer from the mode collapse problem, where the synthesized instances are highly similar to each other and thus show limited effectiveness for downstream tasks, such as knowledge distillation. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Model Inversion (CMI), where the data diversity is explicitly modeled as an optimizable objective, to alleviate the mode collapse issue. Our main observation is that, under the constraint of the same amount of data, higher data diversity usually indicates stronger instance discrimination. To this end, we introduce in CMI a contrastive learning objective that encourages the synthesizing instances to be distinguishable from the already synthesized ones in previous batches. Experiments of pre-trained models on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CMI not only generates more visually plausible instances than the state of the arts, but also achieves significantly superior performance when the generated data are used for knowledge distillation.

In these two-sided markets, not only do the users draw utility from the rankings, but the rankings also determine the utility (e.g. exposure, revenue) for the item providers (e.g. publishers, sellers, artists, studios). It has already been noted that myopically optimizing utility to the users -- as done by virtually all learning-to-rank algorithms -- can be unfair to the item providers. We, therefore, present a learning-to-rank approach for explicitly enforcing merit-based fairness guarantees to groups of items (e.g. articles by the same publisher, tracks by the same artist). In particular, we propose a learning algorithm that ensures notions of amortized group fairness, while simultaneously learning the ranking function from implicit feedback data. The algorithm takes the form of a controller that integrates unbiased estimators for both fairness and utility, dynamically adapting both as more data becomes available. In addition to its rigorous theoretical foundation and convergence guarantees, we find empirically that the algorithm is highly practical and robust.",

        "abstract": "A network of robots can be viewed as a signal graph, describing the underlying network topology with naturally distributed architectures, whose nodes are assigned to data values associated with each robot. Graph neural networks (GNNs) learn representations from signal graphs, thus making them well-suited candidates for learning distributed controllers. Oftentimes, existing GNN architectures assume ideal scenarios, while ignoring the possibility that this distributed graph may change along time due to link failures or topology variations, which can be found in dynamic settings. A mismatch between the graphs on which GNNs were trained and the ones on which they are tested is thus formed. Utilizing online learning, GNNs can be retrained at testing time, overcoming this issue. However, most online algorithms are centralized and work on convex problems (which GNNs scarcely lead to). This paper introduces novel architectures which solve the convexity restriction and can be easily updated in a distributed, online manner. Finally, we provide experiments, showing how these models can be applied to optimizing formation control in a swarm of flocking robots.",

        "abstract": "When can cooperation arise from self-interested decisions in public goods games? And how can we help agents to act cooperatively? We examine these classical questions in a pivotal participation game, a variant of public good games, where heterogeneous agents make binary participation decisions on contributing their endowments, and the public project succeeds when it has enough contributions. \r\n\r\nWe prove it is NP-complete to decide the existence of a cooperative Nash equilibrium such that the project succeeds. We demonstrate that the decision problem becomes easy if agents are homogeneous enough.  \r\nWe then propose two algorithms to help cooperation in the game.  Our first algorithm adds an external investment to the public project, and our second algorithm uses matching funds.  We show the cost to induce a cooperative Nash equilibrium is near-optimal for both algorithms.  Finally, the cost of matching funds can always be smaller than the cost of adding an external investment. Intuitively, matching funds provide a greater incentive for cooperation than adding an external investment does.",

        "abstract": "Due to the dynamic health status of patients and discrepant stability of physiological variables, health data often presents as irregular multi-rate multivariate time series (IMR-MTS) with significantly varying sampling rates. Existing methods mainly study changes of IMR-MTS values in the time domain, without considering their different dominant frequencies and varying data quality. Hence, we propose a novel Cooperative Joint Attentive Network (CJANet) to analyze IMR-MTS in frequency domain, which adaptively handling discrepant dominant frequencies while tackling diverse data qualities caused by irregular sampling. In particular, novel dual-channel joint attention is designed to jointly identify important magnitude and phase signals while detecting their dominant frequencies, automatically enlarging the positive influence of key variables and frequencies. Furthermore, a new cooperative learning module is introduced to enhance information exchange between magnitude and phase channels, effectively integrating global signals to optimize the network. A frequency-aware fusion strategy is finally designed to aggregate the learned features. Extensive experimental results on real-world medical datasets indicate that CJANet significantly outperforms existing methods and provides highly interpretable results.",

Existing multi-label classification models generally consider labels as categorical variables and ignore the exploitation of label semantics. In this paper, we view the task as a correlation-guided text representation problem: an attention-based two-step framework is proposed to integrate text information and label semantics by jointly learning words and labels in the same space. In this way, we aim to capture high-order label-label correlations as well as context-label correlations. Specifically, the proposed approach works by learning token-level representations of words and labels globally through a multi-layer Transformer and constructing an attention vector through word-label correlation matrix to generate the text representation. It ensures that relevant words receive higher weights than irrelevant words and thus directly optimizes the classification performance.  Extensive experiments over benchmark multi-label datasets clearly validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and further analysis demonstrates that it is competitive in both predicting low-frequency labels and convergence speed.",

The form, comprehensibility, and even existence of such explanations remain open problems, investigated as part of explainable AI. We adopt the approach of counterfactual explanations and apply it to decisions made by declarative optimization models. We argue that inverse combinatorial optimization is particularly suited for counterfactual explanations but that the computational difficulties and relatively nascent literature make its application a challenge. To make progress, we address the case of counterfactual explanations that isolate the minimal differences for an individual. We show that under two common optimization functions, full inverse optimization is unnecessary. In particular, we show that for functions of the form of the sum of weighted binary variables, which includes frameworks such as weighted MaxSAT, a solution can be found by solving a slightly modified version of the original optimization model. In contrast, the sum of weighted integer variables can be solved with a binary search over a series of modifications to the original model.",

        "abstract": "Accurate prediction of pedestrian crossing behaviors by autonomous vehicles can significantly improve traffic safety. Existing approaches often model pedestrian behaviors using trajectories or poses but do not offer a deeper semantic interpretation of a person's actions or how actions influence a pedestrian's intention to cross in the future. In this work, we follow the neuroscience and psychological literature to define pedestrian crossing behavior as a combination of an unobserved inner will (a probabilistic representation of binary intent of crossing vs. not crossing) and a set of multi-class actions (e.g., walking, standing, etc.). Intent generates actions, and the future actions in turn reflect the intent. We present a novel multi-task network that predicts future pedestrian actions and uses predicted future action as a prior to detect the present intent and action of the pedestrian. We also designed an attention relation network to incorporate external environmental contexts thus further improve intent and action detection performance. We evaluated our approach on two naturalistic driving datasets, PIE and JAAD, and extensive experiments show significantly improved and more explainable results for both intent detection and  action prediction over state-of-the-art approaches.

        "abstract": "Few-shot classification aims to recognize unseen classes with few labeled samples from each class. Many meta-learning models for few-shot classification elaborately design various task-shared inductive bias (meta-knowledge) to solve such tasks, and achieve impressive performance. However, when there exists the domain shift between the training tasks and the test tasks, the obtained inductive bias fails to generalize across domains, which degrades the performance of the meta-learning models. In this work, we aim to improve the robustness of the inductive bias through task augmentation. Concretely, we consider the worst-case problem around the source task distribution, and propose the adversarial task augmentation method which can generate the inductive bias-adaptive 'challenging' tasks. Our method can be used as a simple plug-and-play module for various meta-learning models, and improve their cross-domain generalization capability. We conduct extensive experiments under the cross-domain setting, using nine few-shot classification datasets: mini-ImageNet, CUB, Cars, Places, Plantae, CropDiseases, EuroSAT, ISIC and ChestX. Experimental results show that our method can effectively improve the few-shot classification performance of the meta-learning models under domain shift, and outperforms the existing works.

To fill this gap, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing CDR approaches, including challenges, research progress, and prospects. Specifically, we first summarize existing CDR approaches into four types, including single-target CDR, single-target multi-domain recommendation (MDR), dual-target CDR, and multi-target CDR. We then present the definitions and challenges of these CDR approaches. Next, we propose a full-view categorization and new taxonomies on these approaches and report their research progress in detail. In the end, we share several promising prospects in CDR.",

Previous methods for slot filling usually adopt sequence labeling framework, which, however, often has limited ability when dealing with the domain-specific slots. In this paper, we take a new perspective on cross-domain slot filling by framing it as a machine reading comprehension (MRC) problem. Our approach firstly transforms slot names into well-designed queries, which contain rich informative prior knowledge and are very helpful for the detection of domain-specific slots. In addition, we utilize the large-scale MRC dataset for pre-training, which further alleviates the data scarcity problem. Experimental results on SNIPS and ATIS datasets show that our approach consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.",

Recently, limited by expensive labeled data, contrastive learning based graph-level representation learning attracts considerable attention. However, these methods mainly focus on graph augmentation for positive samples, while the effect of negative samples is less explored. In this paper, we study the impact of negative samples on learning graph-level representations, and a novel curriculum contrastive learning framework for self-supervised graph-level representation, called CuCo, is proposed. Specifically, we introduce four graph augmentation techniques to obtain the positive and negative samples, and utilize graph neural networks to learn their representations. Then a scoring function is proposed to sort negative samples from easy to hard and a pacing function is to automatically select the negative samples in each training procedure. Extensive experiments on fifteen graph classification real-world datasets, as well as the parameter analysis, well demonstrate that our proposed CuCo yields truly encouraging results in terms of performance on classification and convergence.",

The translation of PDDL into FDR is complex and has a lot of choice points---it involves identifying so called mutex groups---but most systems rely on the translator that comes with Fast Downward. Yet the translation choice points can strongly impact performance. Prior work has considered optimizing FDR encodings in terms of the number of variables produced. Here we go one step further by proposing to custom-design FDR encodings, optimizing the encoding to suit particular planning techniques. We develop such a custom design here for red-black planning, a partial delete relaxation technique. The FDR encoding affects the causal graph and the domain transition graph structures, which govern the tractable fragment of red-black planning and hence affects the respective heuristic function. We develop integer linear programming techniques optimizing the scope of that fragment in the resulting FDR encoding. We empirically show that the performance of red-black planning can be improved through such FDR custom design.",

        "abstract": "Shared-account  Cross-domain  Sequential  Recommendation (SCSR)  is the task of recommending the next item based on a sequence of recorded user behaviors, where multiple users share a single account, and their behaviours are available in multiple domains. Existing work on solving SCSR mainly relies on mining sequential patterns via RNN-based models, which are not expressive enough to capture the relationships among multiple entities. Moreover, all existing algorithms try to bridge two domains via knowledge transfer in the latent space, and the explicit cross-domain graph structure is unexploited. In this work, we propose a novel graph-based solution, namely DA-GCN, to address the above challenges. Specifically, we first link users and items in each domain as a graph. Then, we devise a domain-aware graph convolution network to learn user-specific node representations. To fully account for users' domain-specific preferences on items, two novel attention mechanisms are further developed to selectively guide the message passing process. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our DA-GCN method.",

Here, we combine the advantages of the popular bandit-based HPO method Hyperband (HB) and the evolutionary search approach of Differential Evolution (DE) to yield a new HPO method which we call DEHB. Comprehensive results on a very broad range of HPO problems, as well as a wide range of tabular benchmarks from neural architecture search, demonstrate that DEHB achieves strong performance far more robustly than all previous HPO methods we are aware of, especially for high-dimensional problems with discrete input dimensions. For example, DEHB is up to 1000x faster than random search. It is also efficient in computational time, conceptually simple and easy to implement, positioning it well to become a new default HPO method.",

We develop an assessment module that lets an AI system execute high-level instruction sequences in simulators and answer the user queries about its execution of sequences of actions. Our results show that such a primitive query-response capability is sufficient to efficiently derive a user-interpretable model of the system in stationary, fully observable, and deterministic settings.",

        "abstract": "Rideshare and ride-pooling platforms use artificial intelligence-based matching algorithms to pair riders and drivers. However, these platforms can induce unfairness either through an unequal income distribution or disparate treatment of riders. We investigate two methods to reduce forms of inequality in ride-pooling platforms: by incorporating fairness constraints into the objective function and redistributing income to drivers who deserve more. To test these out, we use New York City taxi data to evaluate their performance on both the rider and driver side. For the first method, we find that optimizing for driver fairness out-performs state-of-the-art models in terms of the number of riders serviced, showing that optimizing for fairness can assist profitability in certain circumstances. For the second method, we explore income redistribution as a method to combat income inequality by having drivers keep an $r$ fraction of their income, and contribute the rest to a redistribution pool. For certain values of $r$, most drivers earn near their Shapley value, while still incentivizing drivers to maximize income, thereby avoiding the free-rider problem and reducing income variability. While the first method is useful because it improves both rider and driver-side fairness, the second method is useful because it improves fairness without affecting profitability, and both methods can be combined to improve rider and driver-side fairness.",

        "abstract": "Sequential decision-making under cost-sensitive tasks is prohibitively daunting, especially for the problem that has a significant impact on people's daily lives, such as malaria control, treatment recommendation. The main challenge faced by policymakers is to learn a policy from scratch by interacting with a complex environment in a few trials. This work introduces a practical, data-efficient policy learning method, named Variance-Bonus Monte Carlo Tree Search~(VB-MCTS), which can copy with very little data and facilitate learning from scratch in only a few trials. Specifically, the solution is a model-based reinforcement learning method. To avoid model bias, we apply Gaussian Process~(GP) regression to estimate the transitions explicitly. With the GP world model, we propose a variance-bonus reward to measure the uncertainty about the world. Adding the reward to the planning with MCTS can result in more efficient and effective exploration. Furthermore, the derived polynomial sample complexity indicates that VB-MCTS is sample efficient. Finally, outstanding performance on a competitive world-level RL competition and extensive experimental results verify its advantage over the state-of-the-art on the challenging malaria control task.",

        "abstract": "The existence of uncoupled no-regret learning dynamics  converging to correlated equilibria in normal-form games is a celebrated result in the theory of multi-agent systems. Specifically, it has been known for more than 20 years that when all players seek to minimize their internal regret in a repeated normal-form game, the empirical frequency of play converges to a normal-form correlated equilibrium. Extensive-form games generalize normal-form games by modeling both sequential and simultaneous moves, as well as imperfect information. Because of the sequential nature and the presence of private information, correlation in extensive-form games possesses significantly different properties than in normal-form games. The extensive-form correlated equilibrium (EFCE) is the natural extensive-form counterpart to the classical notion of correlated equilibrium in normal-form games. Compared to the latter, the constraints that define the set of EFCEs are significantly more complex, as the correlation device ({\\em a.k.a.} mediator) must take into account the evolution of beliefs of each player as they make observations throughout the game. Due to this additional complexity, the existence of uncoupled learning dynamics leading to an EFCE has remained a challenging open research question for a long time. In this article, we settle that question by giving the first uncoupled no-regret dynamics which provably converge to the set of EFCEs in n-player general-sum extensive-form games with perfect recall. We show that each iterate can be computed in time polynomial in the size of the game tree, and that, when all players play repeatedly according to our learning dynamics, the empirical frequency of play after T game repetitions is guaranteed to be a O(T^-1/2)-approximate EFCE with high probability, and an EFCE almost surely in the limit.",

To conform with privacy and confidentiality requirements, these agencies are often required to release privacy-preserving versions of the data. This paper studies the release of differentially private datasets and analyzes their impact on some critical resource allocation tasks under a fairness perspective.  The paper shows that, when the decisions take as input differentially private data, the noise added to achieve privacy disproportionately impacts some groups over others. The paper analyzes the reasons for these disproportionate impacts and proposes guidelines to mitigate these effects.

Therefore, retraining is required to resume the performance of the compressed models suitable for different devices. In this paper, we propose Decomposable-Net (the network decomposable in any size), which allows flexible changes to model size without retraining. We decompose weight matrices in the DNNs via singular value decomposition and adjust ranks according to the target model size. Unlike the existing low-rank compression methods that specialize the model to a fixed size, we propose a novel backpropagation scheme that jointly minimizes losses for both of full- and low-rank networks. This enables not only to maintain the performance of a full-rank network {\\it without retraining} but also to improve low-rank networks in multiple sizes. Additionally, we introduce a simple criterion for rank selection that effectively suppresses approximation error. In experiments on the ImageNet classification task, Decomposable-Net yields superior accuracy in a wide range of model sizes. In particular, Decomposable-Net achieves the top-1 accuracy of 73.2% with 0.27xMACs with ResNet-50, compared to Tucker decomposition (67.4% / 0.30x), Trained Rank Pruning (70.6% / 0.28x), and universally slimmable networks (71.4% / 0.26x).",

It is equivalent to the problem of counting integer points inside a polytope. However, state-of-the-art algorithms for this problem become too slow for even a modest number of variables. In this paper, we propose new decomposition techniques which target both the elimination of variables as well as inequalities using structural properties of counting problems.

        "abstract": "Argumentation is a widely applied framework for modeling and evaluating arguments and its reasoning with various applications. Popular frameworks are abstract argumentation (Dung\u2019s framework) or logic-based argumentation (Besnard-Hunter\u2019s framework). Their computational complexity has been studied quite in-depth. Incorporating treewidth into the complexity analysis is particularly interesting, as solvers oftentimes employ SAT-based solvers, which can solve instances of low treewidth fast. In this paper, we address whether one can design reductions from argumentation problems to SAT-problems while linearly preserving the treewidth, which results in decomposition-guided (DG) reductions. It turns out that the linear treewidth overhead caused by our DG reductions, cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions. Finally, we consider logic-based argumentation and establish new upper bounds using DG reductions and lower bounds.",

        "abstract": "Automatic image matting (AIM) refers to estimating the soft foreground from an arbitrary natural image without any auxiliary input like trimap, which is useful for image editing. Prior methods try to learn semantic features to aid the matting process while being limited to images with salient opaque foregrounds such as humans and animals. In this paper, we investigate the difficulties when extending them to natural images with salient transparent/meticulous foregrounds or non-salient foregrounds. To address the problem, a novel end-to-end matting network is proposed, which can predict a generalized trimap for any image of the above types as a unified semantic representation. Simultaneously, the learned semantic features guide the matting network to focus on the transition areas via an attention mechanism. We also construct a test set AIM-500 that contains 500 diverse natural images covering all types along with manually labeled alpha mattes, making it feasible to benchmark the generalization ability of AIM models. Results of the experiments demonstrate that our network trained on available composite matting datasets outperforms existing methods both objectively and subjectively.

However, much modern machine learning focuses on complex data such as images, text, and graphs where deep learning is used but the raw features of data are not interpretable. This paper explores a novel setting for performing clustering on complex data while simultaneously generating explanations using interpretable tags. We propose deep descriptive clustering that performs sub-symbolic representation learning on complex data while generating explanations based on symbolic data. We form good clusters by maximizing the mutual information between empirical distribution on the inputs and the induced clustering labels for clustering objectives. We generate explanations by solving an integer linear programming that generates concise and orthogonal descriptions for each cluster. Finally, we allow the explanation to inform better clustering by proposing a novel pairwise loss with self-generated constraints to maximize the clustering and explanation module's consistency. Experimental results on public data demonstrate that our model outperforms competitive baselines in clustering performance while offering high-quality cluster-level explanations.",

        "abstract": "Domain adaptation is critical for learning transferable features that effectively reduce the distribution difference among domains. In the era of big data, the availability of large-scale labeled datasets motivates partial domain adaptation (PDA) which deals with adaptation from large source domains to small target domains with less number of classes. In the PDA setting, it is crucial to transfer relevant source samples and eliminate irrelevant ones to mitigate negative transfer. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based source data selector for PDA, which is capable of eliminating less relevant source samples automatically to boost existing adaptation methods. It determines to either keep or discard the source instances based on their feature representations so that more effective knowledge transfer across domains can be achieved via filtering out irrelevant samples. As a general module, the proposed DRL-based data selector can be integrated into any existing domain adaptation or partial domain adaptation models. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DRL-based data selector which leads to state-of-the-art performance for various PDA tasks.",

Second, a transition feasibility model is proposed for hexapod robots, which describes the feasibility of the state transition under the condition of satisfying kinematics and dynamics, and in turn determines the rewards. Third, the footholds and Center-of-Mass (CoM) sequences are sampled from a diagonal Gaussian distribution and the sequences are optimized through learning the optimal policies using the designed DRL algorithm.

        "abstract": "In video games, \\non-player characters (NPCs) are used to enhance the players' experience in a variety of ways, e.g., as enemies, allies, or innocent bystanders. A crucial component of NPCs is navigation, which allows them to move from one point to another on the map. The most popular approach for NPC navigation in the video game industry is to use a navigation mesh (NavMesh), which is a graph representation of the map, with nodes and edges indicating traversable areas. Unfortunately, complex navigation abilities that extend the character's capacity for movement, e.g., grappling hooks, jetpacks, teleportation, or double-jumps, increase the complexity of the NavMesh, making it intractable in many practical scenarios. Game designers are thus constrained to only add abilities that can be handled by a NavMesh. As an alternative to the NavMesh, we propose to use Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) to learn how to navigate 3D maps in video games using any navigation ability. We test our approach on complex 3D environments that are notably an order of magnitude larger than maps typically used in the Deep RL literature. One of these environments is from a recently released AAA video game called Hyper Scape. We find that our approach performs surprisingly well, achieving at least 90% success rate in a variety of scenarios using complex navigation abilities.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing amount of multimedia data, cross-modality hashing has made great progress as it achieves sub-linear search time and low memory space. However, due to the huge discrepancy between different modalities, most existing cross-modality hashing methods cannot learn unified hash codes and functions for modalities at the same time. The gap between separated hash codes and functions further leads to bad search performance. In this paper, to address the issues above, we propose a novel end-to-end Deep Unified Cross-Modality Hashing method named DUCMH, which is able to jointly learn unified hash codes and unified hash functions by alternate learning and data alignment. Specifically, to reduce the discrepancy between image and text modalities, DUCMH utilizes data alignment to learn an auxiliary image to text mapping under the supervision of image-text pairs. For text data, hash codes can be obtained by unified hash functions, while for image data, DUCMH first maps images to texts by the auxiliary mapping, and then uses the mapped texts to obtain hash codes. DUCMH utilizes alternate learning to update unified hash codes and functions. Extensive experiments on three representative image-text datasets demonstrate the superiority of our DUCMH over several state-of-the-art cross-modality hashing methods.",

        "abstract": "Although deep learning has demonstrated its outstanding performance on image classification, most well-known deep networks make efforts to optimize both their structures and their node weights for recognizing fewer (e.g., no more than 1000) object classes. Therefore, it is attractive to extend or mixture such well-known deep networks to support large-scale image classification. According to our best knowledge, how to adaptively and effectively fuse multiple CNNs for large-scale image classification is still under-explored. On this basis, a deep mixture algorithm is developed to support large-scale image classification in this paper. First, a soft spectral clustering method is developed to construct a two-layer ontology (group layer and category layer) by assigning large numbers of image categories into a set of groups according to their inter-category semantic correlations, where the semantically-related image categories under the neighbouring group nodes may share similar learning complexities. Then, such two-layer ontology is further used to generate the task groups, in which each task group contains partial image categories with similar learning complexities and one particular base deep network is learned. Finally, a gate network is learned to combine all base deep networks with fewer diverse outputs to generate a mixture network with larger outputs. Our experimental results on ImageNet10K have demonstrated that our proposed deep mixture algorithm can achieve very competitive results (top 1 accuracy: 32.13%) on large-scale image classification tasks.",

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are malicious images with visually imperceptible perturbations. While these carefully crafted perturbations restricted with tight Lp norm bounds are small, they are still easily perceivable by humans. These perturbations also have limited success rates when attacking black-box models or models with defenses like noise reduction filters. To solve these problems, we propose Demiguise Attack, crafting \"unrestricted\" perturbations with Perceptual Similarity. Specifically, we can create powerful and photorealistic adversarial examples by manipulating semantic information based on Perceptual Similarity. Adversarial examples we generate are friendly to the human visual system (HVS), although the perturbations are of large magnitudes. We extend widely-used attacks with our approach, enhancing adversarial effectiveness impressively while contributing to imperceptibility. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method not only outperforms various state-of-the-art attacks in terms of fooling rate, transferability, and robustness against defenses but can also improve attacks effectively. In addition, we also notice that our implementation can simulate illumination and contrast changes that occur in real-world scenarios, which will contribute to exposing the blind spots of DNNs.",

        "abstract": "Recent work for image captioning mainly followed an extract-then-generate paradigm, pre-extracting a sequence of object-based features and then formulating image captioning as a single sequence-to-sequence task. Although promising, we observed two problems in generated captions: 1) content inconsistency where models would generate contradicting facts; 2) not informative enough where models would miss parts of important information. From a causal perspective, the reason is that models have captured spurious statistical correlations between visual features and certain expressions (e.g., visual features of \"long hair\" and \"woman\"). In this paper, we propose a dependent multi-task learning framework with the causal intervention (DMTCI). Firstly, we involve an intermediate task, bag-of-categories generation, before the final task, image captioning. The intermediate task would help the model better understand the visual features and thus alleviate the content inconsistency problem. Secondly, we apply Pearl's do-calculus on the model, cutting off the link between the visual features and possible confounders and thus letting models focus on the causal visual features. Specifically, the high-frequency concept set is considered as the proxy confounders where the real confounders are inferred in the continuous space. Finally, we use a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) strategy to enable end-to-end training and reduce the inter-task error accumulations. The extensive experiments show that our model outperforms the baseline models and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models.",

        "abstract": "Deep clustering techniques combine representation learning with clustering objectives to improve their performance. Among existing deep clustering techniques, autoencoder-based methods are the most prevalent ones. While they achieve promising clustering results, they suffer from an inherent conflict between preserving details, as expressed by the reconstruction loss, and finding similar groups by ignoring details, as expressed by the clustering loss. This conflict leads to brittle training procedures, dependence on trade-off hyperparameters and less interpretable results. We propose our framework, ACe/DeC, that is compatible with Autoencoder Centroid based Deep Clustering methods and automatically learns a latent representation consisting of two separate spaces. The clustering space captures all cluster-specific information and the shared space explains general variation in the data. This separation resolves the above mentioned conflict and allows our method to learn both detailed reconstructions and cluster specific abstractions.\r\nWe evaluate our framework with extensive experiments to show several benefits: (1) cluster performance \u2013 on various data sets we outperform relevant baselines; (2) no hyperparameter tuning \u2013 this improved performance is achieved without introducing new clustering specific hyperparameters; (3) interpretability \u2013 isolating the cluster specific information in a separate space is advantageous for data exploration and interpreting the clustering results; and (4) dimensionality of the embedded space \u2013 we automatically learn a low dimensional space for clustering. \r\nOur ACe/DeC framework isolates cluster information, increases stability and interpretability, while improving cluster performance.",

To address that, this paper aims to leverage the possible inconsistent cues among video frames and proposes a Temporal Dropout 3-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (TD-3DCNN) to detect deepfake videos. In the approach, the fixed-length frame volumes sampled from a video are fed into a 3-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN) to extract features across different scales and identified whether they are real or fake. Especially, a temporal dropout operation is introduced to randomly sample frames in each batch. It serves as a simple yet effective data augmentation and can enhance the representation and generalization ability, avoiding model overfitting and improving detecting accuracy. In this way, the resulting video-level classifier is accurate and effective to identify deepfake videos. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including Celeb-DF(v2) and DFDC clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capacity of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Meeting summarization is a challenging task due to its dynamic interaction nature among multiple speakers and lack of sufficient training data. Existing methods view the meeting as a linear sequence of utterances while ignoring the diverse relations between each utterance. Besides, the limited labeled data further hinders the ability of data-hungry neural models. In this paper, we try to mitigate the above challenges by introducing dialogue-discourse relations. First, we present a Dialogue Discourse-Dware Meeting Summarizer (DDAMS) to explicitly model the interaction between utterances in a meeting by modeling different discourse relations. The core module is a relational graph encoder, where the utterances and discourse relations are modeled in a graph interaction manner. Moreover, we devise a Dialogue Discourse-Aware Data Augmentation (DDADA) strategy to construct a pseudo-summarization corpus from existing input meetings, which is 20 times larger than the original dataset and can be used to pretrain DDAMS. Experimental results on AMI and ICSI meeting datasets show that our full system can achieve SOTA performance. Our codes and outputs are available at https://github.com/xcfcode/DDAMS/.",

        "abstract": "Despite the valuable information contained in software chat messages, disentangling them into distinct conversations is an essential prerequisite for any in-depth analyses that utilize this information. To provide a better understanding of the current state-of-the-art, we evaluate five popular dialog disentanglement approaches on software-related chat. We find that existing approaches do not perform well on disentangling software-related dialogs that discuss technical and complex topics. Further investigation on how well the existing disentanglement measures reflect human satisfaction shows that existing measures cannot correctly indicate human satisfaction on disentanglement results. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce and evaluate a novel measure, named DLD. Using results of human satisfaction, we further summarize four most frequently appeared bad disentanglement cases on software-related chat to insight future improvements. These cases include (i) Ignoring Interaction Patterns, (ii) Ignoring Contextual Information, (iii) Mixing up Topics, and (iv) Ignoring User Relationships. We believe that our findings provide valuable insights on the effectiveness of existing dialog disentanglement approaches and these findings would promote a better application of dialog disentanglement in software engineering.",

        "abstract": "Domain adaptation solves a learning problem in a target domain by utilizing the training data in a different but related source domain. As a simple and efficient method for domain adaptation, correlation alignment transforms the distribution of the source domain by utilizing the covariance matrix of the target domain, such that a model trained on the transformed source data can be applied to the target data. However, when source and target domains come from different institutes, exchanging information between the two domains might pose a potential privacy risk. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a differentially private correlation alignment approach for domain adaptation called PRIMA, which can provide privacy guarantees for both the source and target data. In PRIMA, to relieve the performance degradation caused by perturbing the covariance matrix in high dimensional setting, we present a random subspace ensemble based covariance estimation method which splits the feature spaces of source and target data into several low dimensional subspaces. Moreover, since perturbing the covariance matrix may destroy its positive semi-definiteness, we develop a shrinking based method for the recovery of positive semi-definiteness of the covariance matrix. Experimental results on standard benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach.",

However, most of the existing algorithms for pairwise learning fail to take into consideration the privacy issue in their design.  To address this  issue, previous work studied pairwise learning in the Differential Privacy (DP) model. However, their utilities (population errors) are far from optimal. To address the sub-optimal utility issue, in this paper, we proposed new pure or approximate DP algorithms for pairwise learning. Specifically, under the assumption that the loss functions are Lipschitz, our algorithms could achieve the optimal expected population risk for both strongly convex and general convex cases. We also conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to evaluate the proposed algorithms, experimental results support our theoretical analysis and show the priority of our algorithms.",

Recent video retrieval methods take advantage of multi-modal cues by aggregating them to holistic high-level semantics for matching with text representations in a global view. In contrast to this global alignment, the local alignment of detailed semantics encoded within both multi-modal cues and distinct phrases is still not well conducted. Thus, in this paper, we leverage the hierarchical video-text alignment to fully explore the detailed diverse characteristics in multi-modal cues for fine-grained alignment with local semantics from phrases, as well as to capture a high-level semantic correspondence. Specifically, multi-step attention is learned for progressively comprehensive local alignment and a holistic transformer is utilized to summarize multi-modal cues for global alignment. With hierarchical alignment, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three public video retrieval datasets.",

In this paper, we propose a new measure-based counting approach to regress the predicted density maps to the scattered point-annotated ground truth directly. First, crowd counting is formulated as a measure matching problem. Second, we derive a semi-balanced form of Sinkhorn divergence, based on which a Sinkhorn counting loss is designed for measure matching. Third, we propose a self-supervised mechanism by devising a Sinkhorn scale consistency loss to resist scale changes. Finally, an efficient optimization method is provided to minimize the overall loss function. Extensive experiments on four challenging crowd counting datasets namely ShanghaiTech, UCF-QNRF, JHU++ and NWPU have validated the proposed method.",

Compared with existing solutions, the proposed network has three compelling characteristics. First, unlike previous algorithms, we propose to perform frequency decomposition at feature-level instead of image-level, allowing both low-frequency maps containing structures and high-frequency maps containing details to be continuously refined during the training procedure. Second, we further establish communication channels between low-frequency maps and high-frequency maps to interactively capture structures from high-frequency maps and add them back to low-frequency maps and, simultaneously, extract details from low-frequency maps and send them back to high-frequency maps, thereby removing rain streaks while preserving more delicate features in the input image. Third, different from existing algorithms using convolutional filters consistent in all directions, we propose a direction-aware filter to capture the direction of rain streaks in order to more effectively and thoroughly purge the input images of rain streaks. We extensively evaluate the proposed approach in three representative datasets and experimental results corroborate our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deraining algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Being an indispensable component in location-based social networks, next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation recommends users unexplored POIs based on their recent visiting histories. However, existing work mainly models check-in data as isolated POI sequences, neglecting the crucial collaborative signals from cross-sequence check-in information. Furthermore, the sparse POI-POI transitions restrict the ability of a model to learn effective sequential patterns for recommendation. In this paper, we propose Sequence-to-Graph (Seq2Graph) augmentation for each POI sequence, allowing collaborative signals to be propagated from correlated POIs belonging to other sequences. We then devise a novel Sequence-to-Graph POI Recommender (SGRec), which jointly learns POI embeddings and infers a user's temporal preferences from the graph-augmented POI sequence. To overcome the sparsity of POI-level interactions, we further infuse category-awareness into SGRec with a multi-task learning scheme that captures the denser category-wise transitions. As such, SGRec makes full use of the collaborative signals for learning expressive POI representations, and also comprehensively uncovers multi-level sequential patterns for user preference modelling. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of SGRec against state-of-the-art methods in next POI recommendation.",

To address this problem, we elaborate a novel Discrete Multiple Kernel k-means (DMKKM) model solved by an optimization algorithm that directly obtains the cluster indicator matrix without subsequent discretization procedures. Moreover, DMKKM can strictly measure the correlations among kernels, which is capable of enhancing kernel fusion by reducing redundancy and improving diversity.

        "abstract": "Recent works have shown that a rich set of semantic directions exist in the latent space of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which enables various facial attribute editing applications. However, existing methods may suffer poor attribute variation disentanglement, leading to unwanted change of other attributes when altering the desired one. The semantic directions used by existing methods are at attribute level, which are difficult to model complex attribute correlations, especially in the presence of attribute distribution bias in GAN's training set. In this paper, we propose a novel framework (IALS) that performs Instance-Aware Latent-Space Search to find semantic directions for disentangled attribute editing. The instance information is injected by leveraging the supervision from a set of attribute classifiers evaluated on the input images. We further propose a Disentanglement-Transformation (DT) metric to quantify the attribute transformation and disentanglement efficacy and find the optimal control factor between attribute-level and instance-specific directions based on it. Experimental results on both GAN-generated and real-world images collectively show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods proposed recently by a wide margin.

        "abstract": "Heuristic search methods are widely used in many real-world autonomous systems. Yet, people always want to solve search problems that are larger than time allows. To address these challenging problems, even suboptimally, a planning agent should be smart enough to intelligently allocate its computational resources, to think carefully about where in the state space it should spend time searching. For finding optimal solutions, we must examine every node that is not provably too expensive. In contrast, to find suboptimal solutions when under time pressure, we need to be very selective about which nodes to examine. In this work, we will demonstrate that estimates of uncertainty, represented as belief distributions, can be used to drive search effectively.  This type of algorithmic approach is known as metareasoning, which refers to reasoning about which reasoning to do. We will provide examples of improved algorithms for real-time search, bounded-cost search, and situated planning.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In its most traditional setting, the main concern of optimization theory is the search for optimal solutions for instances of a given computational problem. A recent trend of research in artificial intelligence, called solution diversity, has focused on the development of notions of optimality that may be more appropriate in settings where subjectivity is essential. The idea is that instead of aiming at the development of algorithms that output a single optimal solution, the goal is to investigate algorithms that output a small set of sufficiently good solutions that are sufficiently diverse from one another. In this way, the user has the opportunity to choose the solution that is most appropriate to the context at hand. It also displays the richness of the solution space. \r\n\r\nWhen combined with techniques from parameterized complexity theory, the paradigm of diversity of solutions offers a powerful algorithmic framework to address problems of practical relevance. In this work, we investigate the impact of this combination in the field of Kemeny Rank Aggregation, a well-studied class of problems lying in the intersection of order theory and social choice theory and also in the field of order theory itself. In particular, we show that KRA is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to natural parameters providing natural formalizations of the notions of diversity and of the notion of a sufficiently good solution. Our main results work both when considering the traditional setting of aggregation over linearly ordered votes, and in the more general setting where votes are partially ordered.",

Previously proposed graph-based or transformer-based models utilize the entities independently, regardless of global information among relational triples. This paper approaches the problem by predicting an entity-level relation matrix to capture local and global information, parallel to the semantic segmentation task in computer vision. Herein, we propose a Document U-shaped Network for document-level relation extraction. Specifically, we leverage an encoder module to capture the context information of entities and a U-shaped segmentation module over the image-style feature map to capture global interdependency among triples.

We  empirically  verify  that SRSs  can  be  misguided  with  such  unreliable  instances  (i.e.   targets  mismatch  inputs).   This  inspires  us  to  design  a  novel  SRS By Eliminating unReliable Data (BERD) guided with two observations:  (1) unreliable instances generally have high training  loss;  and  (2)  high-loss  instances  are  not necessarily  unreliable  but  uncertain  ones  caused by blurry sequential pattern.  Accordingly, BERD models both loss and uncertainty of each instance via a Gaussian distribution to better distinguish unreliable instances; meanwhile an uncertainty-aware graph  convolution  network  is  exploited  to  assist in mining unreliable instances by lowering uncertainty.   Extensive  experiments  on  four  real-world datasets  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  our  proposed BERD.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we propose a domain generalization (DG) approach to learn on several labeled source domains and transfer knowledge to a target domain that is inaccessible in training. Considering the inherent conditional and label shifts, we would expect the alignment of p(x|y) and p(y). However, the widely used domain invariant feature learning (IFL) methods relies on aligning the marginal concept shift w.r.t. p(x), which rests on an unrealistic assumption that p(y) is invariant across domains. We thereby propose a novel variational Bayesian inference framework to enforce the conditional distribution alignment w.r.t. p(x|y) via the prior distribution matching in a latent space, which also takes the marginal label shift w.r.t. p(y) into consideration with the posterior alignment. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our framework is robust to the label shift and the cross-domain accuracy is significantly improved, thereby achieving superior performance over the conventional IFL counterparts.",

Most existing methods regard ZS-SBIR as a traditional classification problem and employ a cross-entropy or triplet-based loss to achieve retrieval, which neglect the problems of the domain gap between sketches and natural images and the large intra-class diversity in sketches. Toward this end, we propose a novel Domain-Smoothing Network (DSN) for ZS-SBIR. Specifically, a cross-modal contrastive method is proposed to learn generalized representations to smooth the domain gap by mining relations with additional augmented samples. Furthermore, a category-specific memory bank with sketch features is explored to reduce intra-class diversity in the sketch domain.

        "abstract": "Inspired by the recent COVID-19 pandemic, we study a generalization of the multi-resource allocation problem with heterogeneous demands and Leontief utilities. Unlike existing settings, we allow each agent to specify requirements to only accept allocations from a subset of the total supply for each resource. These requirements can take form in location constraints (e.g. A hospital can only accept volunteers who live nearby due to commute limitations). This can also model a type of substitution effect where some agents need 1 unit of resource A \\emph{or} B, both belonging to the same meta-type. But some agents specifically want A, and others specifically want B. We propose a new mechanism called Dominant Resource Fairness with Meta Types which determines the allocations by solving a small number of linear programs. The proposed method  satisfies Pareto optimality, envy-freeness, strategy-proofness, and a notion of sharing incentive for our setting. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study this problem formulation, which improved upon existing work by capturing more constraints that often arise in real life situations. Finally, we show numerically that our method scales better to large problems than alternative approaches.",

Intrinsic motivation guidances have thus been developed toward alleviating the resulting exploration problem. They usually incentivize agents to look for new states through novelty signals. Yet, such methods encourage exhaustive exploration of the state space rather than focusing on the environment's salient interaction opportunities. We propose a new exploration method, called Don't Do What Doesn't Matter (DoWhaM), shifting the emphasis from state novelty to state with relevant actions. While most actions consistently change the state when used, e.g. moving the agent, some actions are only effective in specific states, e.g., opening a door, grabbing an object. DoWhaM detects and rewards actions that seldom affect the environment.\r\nWe evaluate DoWhaM on the procedurally-generated environment MiniGrid against state-of-the-art methods. Experiments consistently show that DoWhaM greatly reduces sample complexity, installing the new state-of-the-art in MiniGrid.",

        "abstract": "Previous research has demonstrated the power of leveraging prior knowledge to improve the performance of deep models in natural language processing. However, traditional methods neglect the fact that redundant and irrelevant knowledge exists in external knowledge bases. In this study, we launched an in-depth empirical investigation into downstream tasks and found that knowledge-enhanced approaches do not always exhibit satisfactory improvements. To this end, we investigate the fundamental reasons for ineffective knowledge infusion and present selective injection for language pretraining, which constitutes a model-agnostic method and is readily pluggable into previous approaches. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach can enhance state-of-the-art knowledge injection methods.",

        "abstract": "To learn an effective model with less training examples, existing active learning methods typically assume that there is a given target model, and try to fit it by selecting the most informative examples. However, it is less likely to determine the best target model in prior, and thus may get suboptimal performance even if the data is perfectly selected. To tackle with this practical challenge, this paper proposes a novel framework of dual active learning (DUAL) to simultaneously perform model search and data selection. Specifically, an effective method with truncated importance sampling is proposed for Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter optimization (CASH), which mitigates the model evaluation bias on the labeled data. Further, we propose an active query strategy to label the most valuable examples. The strategy on one hand favors discriminative data to help CASH search the best model, and on the other hand prefers informative examples to accelerate the convergence of winner models. Extensive experiments are conducted on 12 openML datasets. The results demonstrate the proposed method can effectively learn a superior model with less labeled examples.",

        "abstract": "Face anti-spoofing approaches based on domain generalization (DG) have drawn growing attention due to their robustness for unseen scenarios. Previous methods treat each sample from multiple domains indiscriminately during the training process, and endeavor to extract a common feature space to improve the generalization. However, due to complex and biased data distribution, directly treating them equally will corrupt the generalization ability. To settle the issue, we propose a novel Dual Reweighting Domain Generalization (DRDG) framework which iteratively reweights the relative importance between samples to further improve the generalization.  Concretely, Sample Reweighting Module is first proposed to identify samples with relatively large domain bias, and reduce their impact on the overall optimization. Afterwards, Feature Reweighting Module is introduced to focus on these samples and extract more domain-irrelevant features via a self-distilling mechanism. Combined with the domain discriminator, the iteration of the two modules promotes the extraction of generalized features. Extensive experiments and visualizations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our method against the state-of-the-art competitors.",

        "abstract": "Face anti-spoofing (FAS) plays a vital role in securing face recognition systems. Recently, central difference convolution (CDC) has shown its excellent representation capacity for the FAS task via leveraging local gradient features. However, aggregating central difference clues from all neighbors/directions simultaneously makes the CDC redundant and sub-optimized in the training phase. In this paper, we propose two Cross Central Difference Convolutions (C-CDC), which exploit the difference of the center and surround sparse local features from the horizontal/vertical and diagonal directions, respectively. It is interesting to find that, with only five ninth parameters and less computational cost, C-CDC even outperforms the full directional CDC. Based on these two decoupled C-CDC, a powerful Dual-Cross Central Difference Network (DC-CDN) is established with Cross Feature Interaction Modules (CFIM) for mutual relation mining and local detailed representation enhancement. Furthermore, a novel Patch Exchange (PE) augmentation strategy for FAS is proposed via simply exchanging the face patches as well as their dense labels from random samples. Thus, the augmented samples contain richer live/spoof patterns and diverse domain distributions, which benefits the intrinsic and robust feature learning. Comprehensive experiments are performed on four benchmark datasets with three testing protocols to demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance.",

        "abstract": "The spread of DeepFake videos causes a serious threat to information security, calling for effective detection methods to distinguish them. However, the performance of recent frame-based detection methods become limited due to their ignorance of the inter-frame inconsistency of fake videos. In this paper, we propose a novel Dynamic Inconsistency-aware Network to handle the inconsistent problem, which uses a Cross-Reference module (CRM) to capture both the global and local inter-frame inconsistencies. The CRM contains two parallel branches. The first branch takes faces from adjacent frames as input, and calculates a structure similarity map for a global inconsistency representation. The second branch only focuses on the inter-frame variation of independent critical regions, which captures the local inconsistency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to totally use the inter-frame inconsistency information from the global and local perspectives. Compared with existing methods, our model provides a more accurate and robust detection on FaceForensics++, DFDC-preview and Celeb-DFv2 datasets.",

        "abstract": "Traffic signal control has achieved significant success with the development of reinforcement learning. However, existing works mainly focus on intersections with normal lanes with fixed outgoing directions. It is noticed that some intersections actually implement dynamic lanes, in addition to normal lanes, to adjust the outgoing directions dynamically. Existing methods fail to coordinate the control of traffic signal and that of dynamic lanes effectively. In addition, they lack proper structures and learning algorithms to make full use of traffic flow prediction, which is essential to set the proper directions for dynamic lanes. Motivated by the ineffectiveness of existing approaches when controlling the traffic signal and dynamic lanes simultaneously, we propose a new method, namely MT-GAD, in this paper. It uses a group attention structure to reduce the number of required parameters and to achieve a better generalizability, and uses multi-timescale model training to learn proper strategy that could best control both the traffic signal and the dynamic lanes. The experiments on real datasets demonstrate that MT-GAD outperforms existing approaches significantly.",

Motivated by the application of live Q&A platforms, where submitted questions need to be ranked based on the interests of the audience, we study a dynamic extension of the proportional rankings setting. In our setting, the goal is to maintain the proportionality of a ranking when alternatives (i.e., questions)---not necessarily from the top of the ranking---get selected sequentially. We propose generalizations of well-known aggregation rules to this setting and study their monotonicity and proportionality properties. We also evaluate the performance of these rules experimentally, using realistic probabilistic assumptions on the selection procedure.",

        "abstract": "Influenced by the era of the sharing economy and mobile payment, Dockless Bike-Sharing System (Dockless BSS) is expanding in many major cities. The mobility of users constantly leads to supply and demand imbalance, which seriously affects the total profit and customer satisfaction. In this paper, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Mixed Integer Program (STMIP) with Flow-graphed Community Discovery (FCD) approach to rebalancing the system. Different from existing studies that ignore the route of trucks and adopt a centralized rebalancing, our approach considers the spatio-temporal information of trucks and discovers station communities for truck-based rebalancing. First, we propose the FCD algorithm to detect station communities. Significantly, rebalancing communities decomposes the centralized system into a distributed multi-communities system. Then, by considering the routing and velocity of trucks, we design the STMIP model with the objective of maximizing total profit, to find a repositioning policy for each station community. We design a simulator built on real-world data from DiDi Chuxing to test the algorithm performance. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms in terms of service level, profit, and complexity compared with the state-of-the-art approach.",

        "abstract": "The difficulty of deterministic planning increases exponentially with search-tree depth. Black-box planning presents an even greater challenge, since planners must operate without an explicit model of the domain. Heuristics can make search more efficient, but goal-aware heuristics for black-box planning usually rely on goal counting, which is often quite uninformative. In this work, we show how to overcome this limitation by discovering macro-actions that make the goal-count heuristic more accurate. Our approach searches for macro-actions with focused effects (i.e. macros that modify only a small number of state variables), which align well with the assumptions made by the goal-count heuristic. Focused macros dramatically improve black-box planning efficiency across a wide range of planning domains, sometimes beating even state-of-the-art planners with access to a full domain model.",

By leveraging on chordal graph decompositions, we show that the formulation here presented is provably tighter than current approaches. Experiments on a set of benchmark networks show that the approach here proposed enables the verification of more instances compared to other relaxation methods.

        "abstract": "Recently regular decision processes have been proposed as a well-behaved form of non-Markov decision process. Regular decision processes are characterised by a transition function and a reward function that depend on the whole history, though regularly (as in regular languages). In practice both the transition and the reward functions can be seen as finite transducers. We study reinforcement learning in regular decision processes. Our main contribution is to show that a near-optimal policy can be PAC-learned in polynomial time in a set of parameters that describe the underlying decision process. We argue that the identified set of parameters is minimal and it reasonably captures the difficulty of a regular decision process.",

        "abstract": "We build on a recently proposed method for explaining solutions of constraint satisfaction problems. An explanation here is a sequence of simple inference steps, where the simplicity of an inference step is measured by the number and types of constraints and facts used, and where the sequence explains all logical consequences of the problem. We build on these formal foundations and tackle two emerging questions, namely how to generate explanations that are provably optimal (with respect to the given cost metric) and how to generate them efficiently. To answer these questions, we develop 1) an implicit hitting set algorithm for finding optimal unsatisfiable subsets; 2) a method to reduce multiple calls for (optimal) unsatisfiable subsets to a single call that takes constraints on the subset into account, and 3) a method for re-using relevant information over multiple calls to these algorithms. The method is also applicable to other problems that require finding cost-optimal unsatiable subsets. We specifically show that this approach can be used to effectively find sequences of optimal explanation steps for constraint satisfaction problems like logic grid puzzles.",

        "abstract": "Multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) provides clinical information of heartbeats from several fixed viewpoints determined by the lead positioning. However, it is often not satisfactory to visualize ECG signals in these fixed and limited views, as some clinically useful information is represented only from a few specific ECG viewpoints. For the first time, we propose a new concept, Electrocardio Panorama, which allows visualizing ECG signals from any queried viewpoints. To build Electrocardio Panorama, we assume that an underlying electrocardio field exists, representing locations, magnitudes, and directions of ECG signals. We present a Neural electrocardio field Network (Nef-Net), which first predicts the electrocardio field representation by using a sparse set of one or few input ECG views and then synthesizes Electrocardio Panorama based on the predicted representations. Specially, to better disentangle electrocardio field information from viewpoint biases, a new Angular Encoding is proposed to process viewpoint angles. Also, we propose a self-supervised learning approach called Standin Learning, which helps model the electrocardio field without direct supervision. Further, with very few modifications, Nef-Net can synthesize ECG signals from scratch. Experiments verify that our Nef-Net performs well on Electrocardio Panorama synthesis, and outperforms the previous work on the auxiliary tasks (ECG view transformation and ECG synthesis from scratch). The codes and the division labels of cardiac cycles and ECG deflections on Tianchi ECG and PTB datasets are available at https://github.com/WhatAShot/Electrocardio-Panorama.",

        "abstract": "Current instance segmentation methods can be categorized into segmentation-based methods and proposal-based methods. The former performs segmentation first and then does clustering, while the latter detects objects first and then predicts the mask for each object proposal. In this work, we propose a single-stage method, named EmbedMask, that unifies both methods by taking their advantages, so it can achieve good performance in instance segmentation and produce high-resolution masks in a high speed. EmbedMask introduces two newly defined embeddings for mask prediction, which are pixel embedding and proposal embedding. During training, we enforce the pixel embedding to be close to its coupled proposal embedding if they belong to the same instance. During inference, pixels are assigned to the mask of the proposal if their embeddings are similar. This mechanism brings several benefits. First, the pixel-level clustering enables EmbedMask to generate high-resolution masks and avoids the complicated two-stage mask prediction. Second, the existence of proposal embedding simplifies and strengthens the clustering procedure, so our method can achieve high speed and better performance than segmentation-based methods. Without any bell or whistle, EmbedMask outperforms the state-of-the-art instance segmentation method Mask R-CNN on the challenging COCO dataset, obtaining more detailed masks at a higher speed.",

        "abstract": "Coordination is often critical to forming prosocial behaviors -- behaviors that increase the overall sum of rewards received by all agents in a multi-agent game. However, state of the art reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from converging to socially less desirable equilibria when multiple equilibria exist. Previous works address this challenge with explicit reward shaping, which requires the strong assumption that agents can be forced to be prosocial. We propose using a less restrictive peer-rewarding mechanism, gifting, that guides the agents toward more socially desirable equilibria while allowing agents to remain selfish and decentralized. Gifting allows each agent to give some of their reward to other agents. We employ a theoretical framework that captures the benefit of gifting in converging to the prosocial equilibrium by characterizing the equilibria's basins of attraction in a dynamical system. With gifting, we demonstrate increased convergence of high risk, general-sum coordination games to the prosocial equilibrium both via numerical analysis and experiments.",

        "abstract": "Network pruning is a widely used technique to reduce computation cost and model size for deep neural networks. However, the typical three-stage pipeline, i.e., training, pruning and retraining (fine-tuning) significantly increases the overall training trails. In this paper, we develop a systematic weight-pruning optimization approach based on Surrogate Lagrangian relaxation (SLR), which is tailored to overcome difficulties caused by the discrete nature of the weight-pruning problem while ensuring fast convergence. \r\nWe further accelerate the convergence of the SLR by using quadratic penalties. Model parameters obtained by SLR during the training phase are much closer to their optimal values as compared to those obtained by other state-of-the-art methods. We evaluate the proposed method on image classification tasks using CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, as well as object detection tasks using COCO 2014 and Ultra-Fast-Lane-Detection using TuSimple lane detection dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our SLR-based weight-pruning optimization approach achieves higher compression rate than state-of-the-arts under the same accuracy requirement. It also achieves a high model accuracy even at the hard-pruning stage without retraining (reduces the traditional three-stage pruning to two-stage). Given a limited budget of retraining epochs, our approach quickly recovers the model accuracy.",

By formulating this ill-posed problem as a modulation code learning task, our network learns to generate a collection of enhanced images from a given input conditioned on various reference images. Therefore our inference model easily adapts to various user preferences, provided with a few favorable photos from each user. Our model achieves competitive visual and quantitative results on par with fully supervised methods on both noisy and clean datasets, while being 6 to 10 times lighter than state-of-the-art generative adversarial networks (GANs) approaches.",

        "abstract": "Fine-Grained Entity Typing (FGET) is a task that aims at classifying an entity mention into a wide range of entity label types. Recent researches improve the task performance by imposing the label-relational inductive bias based on the hierarchy of labels or label co-occurrence graph. However, they usually overlook explicit interactions between instances and labels which may limit the capability of label representations. Therefore, we propose a novel method based on a two-phase graph network for the FGET task to enhance the label representations, via imposing the relational inductive biases of instance-to-label and label-to-label. In the phase 1, instance features will be introduced into label representations to make the label representations more representative. In the phase 2, interactions of labels will capture dependency relationships among them thus make label representations more smooth. During prediction, we introduce a pseudo-label generator for the construction of the two-phase graph. The input instances differ from batch to batch so that the label representations are dynamic. Experiments on three public datasets verify the effectiveness and stability of our proposed method and achieve state-of-the-art results on their testing sets.",

        "abstract": "We propose an analysis of Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) identification of an \u03f5-best arm in graph bandit models with Gaussian distributions. We consider finite but potentially very large bandit models where the set of arms is endowed with a graph structure, and we assume that the arms' expectations \u03bc are smooth with respect to this graph. Our goal is to identify an arm whose expectation is at most \u03f5 below the largest of all means. We focus on the fixed-confidence setting: given a risk parameter \u03b4, we consider sequential strategies that yield an \u03f5-optimal arm with probability at least 1-\u03b4. All such strategies use at least T*(\u03bc)log(1/\u03b4) samples, where R is the smoothness parameter. We identify the complexity term  T*(\u03bc) as the solution of a min-max problem for which we give a game-theoretic analysis and an approximation procedure. This procedure is the key element required by the asymptotically optimal Track-and-Stop strategy.",

        "abstract": "Symbolic knowledge can provide crucial inductive bias for training neural models, especially in low data regimes. A successful strategy for incorporating such knowledge involves relaxing logical statements into sub-differentiable losses for optimization. In this paper, we study the question of how best to relax logical expressions that represent labeled examples and knowledge about a problem; we focus on sub-differentiable t-norm relaxations of logic. We present theoretical and empirical criteria for characterizing which relaxation would perform best in various scenarios. In our theoretical study driven by the goal of preserving tautologies, the Lukasiewicz t-norm performs best. However, in our empirical analysis on the text chunking and digit recognition tasks, the product t-norm achieves best predictive performance. We analyze this apparent discrepancy, and conclude with a list of best practices for defining loss functions via logic.",

We contribute to this line of research by improving the state of the art regarding the computational complexity of computing good committees. More formally, given a set of candidates C, a set of voters V, each ranking the candidates according to their preferences, and an integer k; a multiwinner voting rule identifies a committee of size k, based on these given voter preferences. In this paper we consider several utilitarian and egailitarian OWA (ordered weighted average) scoring rules, which are an extensively researched family of rules (and a subfamily of the family of committee scoring rules). First, we improve the result of Betzler et al. [JAIR, 2013], which gave a O(n^n) algorithm for computing winner under the Chamberlin Courant rule (CC), where n is the number of voters; to a running time of O(2^n), which is optimal. Furthermore, we study the parameterized complexity of the Pessimist voting rule and describe a few tractable and intractable cases. Apart from such utilitarian voting rules, we extend our study and consider egalitarian median and egalitarian mean (both committee scoring rules), showing some tractable and intractable results, based on nontrivial structural observations.",

        "abstract": "Event-based cameras have attracted increasing attention due to their advantages of biologically inspired paradigm and low power consumption. Since event-based cameras record the visual input as asynchronous discrete events, they are inherently suitable to cooperate with the spiking neural network (SNN). Existing works of SNNs for processing events mainly focus on the task of object recognition. However, events from the event-based camera are triggered by dynamic changes, which makes it an ideal choice to capture actions in the visual scene. Inspired by the dorsal stream in visual cortex, we propose a hierarchical SNN architecture for event-based action recognition using motion information. Motion features are extracted and utilized from events to local and finally to global perception for action recognition. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, it is the first attempt of SNN to apply motion information to event-based action recognition. We evaluate our proposed SNN on three event-based action recognition datasets, including our newly published DailyAction-DVS dataset comprising 12 actions collected under diverse recording conditions. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of motion information and our proposed SNN architecture for event-based action recognition.",

        "abstract": "The advantages of event-sensing over conventional sensors (e.g., higher dynamic range, lower time latency, and lower power consumption) have spurred research into machine learning for event data. Unsurprisingly, deep learning has emerged as a competitive methodology for learning with event sensors; in typical setups, discrete and asynchronous events are first converted into frame-like tensors on which standard deep networks can be applied. However, over-fitting remains a challenge, particularly since event datasets remain small relative to conventional datasets (e.g., ImageNet). In this paper, we introduce EventDrop, a new method for augmenting asynchronous event data to improve the generalization of deep models. By dropping events selected with various strategies, we are able to increase the diversity of training data (e.g., to simulate various levels of occlusion). From a practical perspective, EventDrop is simple to implement and computationally low-cost. Experiments on two event datasets (N-Caltech101 and N-Cars) demonstrate that EventDrop can significantly improve the generalization performance across a variety of deep networks.",

        "abstract": "Non-convex optimization is often involved in artificial intelligence tasks, which may have many saddle points, and is NP-hard to solve. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are general-purpose derivative-free optimization algorithms with a good ability to find the global optimum, which can be naturally applied to non-convex optimization. Their performance is, however, limited due to low efficiency. Gradient descent (GD) runs efficiently, but only converges to a first-order stationary point, which may be a saddle point and thus arbitrarily bad. Some recent efforts have been put into combining EAs and GD. However, previous works either utilized only a specific component of EAs, or just combined them heuristically without theoretical guarantee. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary GD (EGD) algorithm by combining typical components, i.e., population and mutation, of EAs with GD. We prove that EGD can converge to a second-order stationary point by escaping the saddle points, and is more efficient than previous algorithms. Empirical results on non-convex synthetic functions as well as reinforcement learning (RL) tasks also show its superiority.",

Starting from a set of (word, definition) pairs, our approach is capable of automatically generating high-quality sentences which express the requested semantics. As a result, we can drive the creation of sense-tagged data which cover the full range of meanings in any inventory of interest, and their interactions within sentences. Human annotators agree that the sentences generated are as fluent and semantically-coherent with the input definitions as the sentences in manually-annotated corpora.\r\nIndeed, when employed as training data for Word Sense Disambiguation, our examples enable the current state of the art to be outperformed, and higher results to be achieved than when using gold-standard datasets only.

Motivated by this observation, we introduce a novel visual probing framework for explaining the self-supervised models by leveraging probing tasks employed previously in natural language processing. The probing tasks require knowledge about semantic relationships between image parts. Hence, we propose a systematic approach to obtain analogs of natural language in vision, such as visual words, context, and taxonomy. We show the effectiveness and applicability of those analogs in the context of explaining self-supervised representations. Our key findings emphasize that relations between language and vision can serve as an effective yet intuitive tool for discovering how machine learning models work, independently of data modality.

However, there has been a long history of explanation generation in the general field of constraint satisfaction, one of the AI's most ubiquitous subfields. In this paper we survey the major seminal papers on the explanation and constraints, as well as some more recent works. The survey sets out to unify many disparate lines of work in areas such as model-based diagnosis, constraint programming, Boolean satisfiability, truth maintenance systems, quantified logics, and related areas.",

        "abstract": "Biological spiking neurons with intrinsic dynamics underlie the powerful representation and learning capabilities of the brain for processing multimodal information in complex environments. Despite recent tremendous progress in spiking neural networks (SNNs) for handling Euclidean-space tasks, it still remains challenging to exploit SNNs in processing non-Euclidean-space data represented by graph data, mainly due to the lack of effective modeling framework and useful training techniques. Here we present a general spike-based modeling framework that enables the direct training of SNNs for graph learning. Through spatial-temporal unfolding for spiking data flows of node features, we incorporate graph convolution filters into spiking dynamics and formalize a synergistic learning paradigm. Considering the unique features of spike representation and spiking dynamics, we propose a spatial-temporal feature normalization (STFN) technique suitable for SNN to accelerate convergence. We instantiate our methods into two spiking graph models, including graph convolution SNNs and graph attention SNNs, and validate their performance on three node-classification benchmarks, including Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed. Our model can achieve comparable performance with the state-of-the-art graph neural network (GNN) models with much lower computation costs, demonstrating great benefits for the execution on neuromorphic hardware and prompting neuromorphic applications in graphical scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Sequential recommendation systems alleviate the problem of information overload, and have attracted increasing attention in the literature. Most prior works usually obtain an overall representation based on the user\u2019s behavior sequence, which can not sufficiently reflect the multiple interests of the user. To this end, we propose a novel method called PIMI to mitigate this issue. PIMI can model the user\u2019s multi-interest representation effectively by considering both the periodicity and interactivity in the item sequence. Specifically, we design a periodicity-aware module to utilize the time interval information between user\u2019s behaviors. Meanwhile, an ingenious graph is proposed to enhance the interactivity between items in user\u2019s behavior sequence, which can capture both global and local item features. Finally, a multi-interest extraction module is applied to describe user\u2019s multiple interests based on the obtained item representation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets Amazon and Taobao show that PIMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods consistently.",

Based on goal setting theory in psychology, we conduct a randomized experiment to study whether and how setting different goals---including performance goal, learning goal, and behavioral goal---when training workers for a complex crowdsourcing task affects workers' learning perception, learning gain, and post-training performance. We find that setting different goals during training significantly affects workers' learning perception, but does not have an effect on learning gain or post-training performance. Further, exploratory analysis helps shed light on when and why various goals may or may not work in the crowdsourcing context.",

Past work has shown that the RMP construction problem can be reduced to weighted first-order model counting (WFOMC). However, existing reductions in the literature are intractable in practice, since they typically require an infeasibly large number of calls to a WFOMC oracle. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to construct RMPs using fewer oracle calls. As an application, we also show how to apply this new algorithm to improve an existing approximation scheme for WFOMC. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approaches experimentally, and find that our method provides speed-ups over the baseline for RMP construction of a full order of magnitude.",

However, the training process of embedding methods usually involves a complex quadratic or semidefinite programming problem, or the model may even involve an NP-hard problem. Thus, such methods are prohibitive on large-scale applications. More importantly, much of the literature has already shown that the binary relevance (BR) method is usually good enough for some applications.\r\nUnfortunately, BR runs slowly due to its linear dependence on the size of the input data. The goal of this paper is to provide a simple method, yet with provable guarantees, which can achieve competitive performance without a complex training\r\nprocess. To achieve our goal, we provide a simple stochastic sketch strategy for multi-label classification and present theoretical results from both algorithmic and statistical learning perspectives.

The goal is to select a subset from a ground set to maximize a monotone objective function such that a monotone cost function is upper bounded by a budget. Previous algorithms with bounded approximation guarantees include the generalized greedy algorithm, POMC and EAMC, all of which can achieve the best known approximation guarantee. In real-world scenarios, the resources often vary, i.e., the budget often changes over time, requiring the algorithms to adapt the solutions quickly. However, when the budget changes dynamically, all these three algorithms either achieve arbitrarily bad approximation guarantees, or require a long running time. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm FPOMC by combining the merits of the generalized greedy algorithm and POMC. That is, FPOMC introduces a greedy selection strategy into POMC. We prove that FPOMC can maintain the best known approximation guarantee efficiently.",

In addition, a novel evolutionary algorithm called the biased Pareto optimization algorithm, is proposed that achieves a worst-case ratio of (1 \u2212 epsilon)(1 \u2212 1/e \u2212 epsilon) in expectation for every cardinality constraint kappa < P in O(n ln(P ) ln(1/epsilon)) queries of f . Further, the biased Pareto optimization algorithm can be modified in order to achieve a a worst-case ratio of (1 \u2212 epsilon)(1 \u2212 1/e \u2212 epsilon) in expectation for cardinality constraint kappa in O(n ln(1/epsilon)) queries of f . An empirical evaluation corroborates our theoretical analysis of the algorithms, as the algorithms exceed the stochastic greedy solution value at roughly when one would expect based upon our analysis.",

        "abstract": "By adding human-imperceptible perturbations to images, DNNs can be easily fooled. As one of the mainstream methods, feature space targeted attacks perturb images by modulating their intermediate feature maps, for the discrepancy between the intermediate source and target features is minimized. However, the current choice of pixel-wise Euclidean Distance to measure the discrepancy is questionable because it unreasonably imposes a spatial-consistency constraint on the source and target features.\r\nIntuitively, an image can be categorized as \"cat'' no matter the cat is on the left or right of the image. To address this issue, we propose to measure this discrepancy using statistic alignment. Specifically, we design two novel approaches called Pair-wise Alignment Attack and Global-wise Alignment Attack, which attempt to measure similarities between feature maps by high-order statistics with translation invariance. Furthermore, we systematically analyze the layer-wise transferability with varied difficulties to obtain highly reliable attacks. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin.

        "abstract": "Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models under strict privacy restrictions and federated text-to-speech aims to synthesize natural speech of multiple users with a few audio training samples stored in their devices locally. However, federated text-to-speech faces several challenges: very few training samples from each speaker are available, training samples are all stored in local device of each user, and global model is vulnerable to various attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel federated learning architecture based on continual learning approaches to overcome the difficulties above. Specifically, 1) we use gradual pruning masks to isolate parameters for preserving speakers' tones; 2) we apply selective masks for effectively reusing knowledge from tasks; 3) a private speaker embedding is introduced to keep users' privacy. Experiments on a reduced VCTK dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSpeech: it nearly matches multi-task training in terms of multi-speaker speech quality; moreover, it sufficiently retains the speakers' tones and even outperforms the multi-task training in the speaker similarity experiment.",

In this work, we identify a cause of unfairness in FL -- conflicting gradients with large differences in the magnitudes. To address this issue, we propose the federated fair averaging (FedFV) algorithm to mitigate potential conflicts among clients before averaging their gradients. We first use the cosine similarity to detect gradient conflicts, and then iteratively eliminate such conflicts by modifying both the direction and the magnitude of the gradients. We further show the theoretical foundation of FedFV to mitigate the issue conflicting gradients and converge to Pareto stationary solutions. Extensive  experiments on a suite of federated datasets confirm that FedFV compares favorably against state-of-the-art methods in terms of fairness, accuracy and efficiency.

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables distributed agents to collaboratively learn a centralized model without sharing their raw data with each other. However, data locality does not provide sufficient privacy protection, and it is desirable to facilitate FL with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantee. Existing DP mechanisms would introduce random noise with magnitude proportional to the model size, which can be quite large in deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose a new FL framework with sparsification-amplified privacy. Our approach integrates random sparsification with gradient perturbation on each agent to amplify privacy guarantee. Since sparsification would increase the number of communication rounds required to achieve a certain target accuracy, which is unfavorable for DP guarantee, we further introduce acceleration techniques to help reduce the privacy cost. We rigorously analyze the convergence of our approach and utilize Renyi DP to tightly account the end-to-end DP guarantee. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that our approach outperforms previous differentially-private FL approaches in both privacy guarantee and communication efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Conventional federated learning directly averages model weights, which is only possible for collaboration between models with homogeneous architectures. Sharing prediction instead of weight removes this obstacle and eliminates the risk of white-box inference attacks in conventional federated learning. However, the predictions from local models are sensitive and would leak training data privacy to the public. To address this issue, one naive approach is adding the differentially private random noise to the predictions, which however brings a substantial trade-off between privacy budget and model performance. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called FEDMD-NFDP, which applies a Noise-FreeDifferential Privacy (NFDP) mechanism into a federated model distillation framework. Our extensive experimental results on various datasets validate that FEDMD-NFDP can deliver not only comparable utility and communication efficiency but also provide a noise-free differential privacy guarantee. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our FEDMD-NFDP by considering both IID and Non-IID settings, heterogeneous model architectures, and unlabelled public datasets from a different distribution.",

One way to alleviate this problem is to acquire a strong inductive bias via meta-learning on similar tasks. In this paper, we show that such inductive bias can be learned from a flat collection of unlabeled images, and instantiated as transferable representations among seen and unseen classes.   Specifically, we propose a novel part-based self-supervised representation learning scheme to learn transferable representations by maximizing the similarity of an image to its discriminative part. To mitigate the overfitting in few-shot classification caused by data scarcity, we further propose a part augmentation strategy by retrieving extra images from a base dataset. We conduct systematic studies on miniImageNet and tieredImageNet benchmarks. Remarkably, our method yields impressive results, outperforming the previous best unsupervised methods by 7.74% and 9.24% under 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot settings, which are comparable with state-of-the-art supervised methods.",

        "abstract": "Partial-label learning (PLL) generally focuses on inducing a noise-tolerant multi-class classifier by training on overly-annotated samples, each of which is annotated with a set of labels, but only one is the valid label. A basic promise of existing PLL solutions is that there are sufficient partial-label (PL) samples for training. However, it is more common than not to have just few PL samples at hand when dealing with new tasks. Furthermore, existing few-shot learning algorithms assume precise labels of the support set; as such,  irrelevant labels may seriously mislead the meta-learner  and thus lead to a compromised performance. How to enable PLL under a few-shot learning setting is an important problem, but not yet well studied. In this paper, we introduce an approach called FsPLL (Few-shot PLL).  FsPLL first performs adaptive distance metric learning by an embedding network and rectifying prototypes on the tasks previously encountered. Next, it calculates the prototype of each class of a new task in the embedding network. An unseen example can then be classified via its distance to each prototype. Experimental results on widely-used few-shot datasets demonstrate that our FsPLL can achieve a superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods, and it needs fewer samples for quickly adapting to new tasks.",

        "abstract": "Recent neural rendering approaches for human activities achieve remarkable view synthesis results, but still rely on dense input views or dense training with all the capture frames, leading to deployment difficulty and inefficient training overload. However, existing advances will be ill-posed if the input is both spatially and temporally sparse. To fill this gap, in this paper we propose a few-shot neural human rendering approach (FNHR) from only sparse RGBD inputs, which exploits the temporal and spatial redundancy to generate photo-realistic free-view output of human activities. Our FNHR is trained only on the key-frames which expand the motion manifold in the input sequences. We introduce a two-branch neural blending to combine the neural point render and classical graphics texturing pipeline, which integrates reliable observations over sparse key-frames. Furthermore, we adopt a patch-based adversarial training process to make use of the local redundancy and avoids over-fitting to the key-frames, which generates fine-detailed rendering results. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to generate high-quality free view-point results for challenging human performances under the sparse setting.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of fine-grained air quality inference that predicts the air quality level of any location from air quality readings of nearby monitoring stations. We point out the importance of explicitly modeling both static and dynamic spatial correlations, and consequently propose a novel multi-channel attention model (MCAM) that models static and dynamic spatial correlations as separate channels. The static channel combines the beauty of attention mechanisms and graph-based spatial modeling via an adapted bilateral filtering technique, which considers not only locations' Euclidean distances but also their similarity of geo-context features. The dynamic channel learns stations' time-dependent spatial influence on a target location at each time step via long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and attention mechanisms. In addition, we introduce two novel ideas, atmospheric dispersion theories and the hysteretic nature of air pollutant dispersion, to better model the dynamic spatial correlation. We also devise a multi-channel graph convolutional fusion network to effectively fuse the graph outputs, along with other features, from both channels. Our extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that MCAM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions.",

        "abstract": "In machine learning we often encounter structured output prediction problems (SOPPs), i.e. problems where the output space admits a rich internal structure. Application domains where SOPPs naturally occur include natural language processing, speech recognition, and computer vision. Typical SOPPs have an extremely large label set, which grows exponentially as a function of the size of the output. Existing generalization analysis implies generalization bounds with at least a square-root dependency on the cardinality d of the label set, which can be vacuous in practice. In this paper, we significantly improve the state of the art by developing novel high-probability bounds with a logarithmic dependency on d. Furthermore, we leverage the lens of algorithmic stability to develop generalization bounds in expectation without any dependency on d. Our results therefore build a solid theoretical foundation for learning in large-scale SOPPs. Furthermore, we extend our results to learning with weakly dependent data.",

        "abstract": "Watermarking has become the tendency in protecting the intellectual property of DNN models. Recent works, from the adversary's perspective, attempted to subvert watermarking mechanisms by designing watermark removal attacks. However, these attacks mainly adopted sophisticated fine-tuning techniques, which have certain fatal drawbacks or unrealistic assumptions. In this paper, we propose a novel watermark removal attack from a different perspective. Instead of just fine-tuning the watermarked models, we design a simple yet powerful transformation algorithm by combining imperceptible pattern embedding and spatial-level transformations, which can effectively and blindly destroy the memorization of watermarked models to the watermark samples. We also introduce a lightweight fine-tuning strategy to preserve the model performance. Our solution requires much less resource or knowledge about the watermarking scheme than prior works. Extensive experimental results indicate that our attack can bypass state-of-the-art watermarking solutions with very high success rates. Based on our attack, we propose watermark augmentation techniques to enhance the robustness of existing watermarks.",

        "abstract": "Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) synthesis aims at automatically synthesizing a program that complies with desired properties expressed in LTL. Unfortunately it has been proved to be too difficult computationally to perform full LTL synthesis. There have been two success stories with LTL synthesis, both having to do with the form of the specification. The first is the GR(1) approach: use safety conditions to determine the possible transitions in a game between the environment and the agent, plus one powerful notion of fairness, Generalized Reactivity(1), or GR(1). The second, inspired by AI planning, is focusing on finite-trace temporal synthesis, with LTLf (LTL on finite traces) as the specification language. In this paper we take these two lines of work and bring them together. We first study the case in which we have an LTLf agent goal and a GR(1) assumption. We then add to the framework safety conditions for both the environment and the agent, obtaining a highly expressive yet still scalable form of LTL synthesis.",

        "abstract": "Intent detection and slot filling are two main tasks for building a spoken language understanding (SLU) system. Since the two tasks are closely related, the joint models for the two tasks always outperform the pipeline models in SLU. However, most joint models directly incorporate multiple intent information for each token, which introduces intent noise into the sentence semantics, causing a decrease in the performance of the joint model. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Graph Model (DGM) for joint multiple intent detection and slot filling, in which we adopt a sentence-level intent-slot interactive graph to model the correlation between the intents and slot. Besides, we design a novel method of constructing the graph, which can dynamically update the interactive graph and further alleviate the error propagation. Experimental results on several multi-intent and single-intent datasets show that our model not only achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance but also boosts the speed by three to six times over the SOTA model.",

We focus on the so-called ordinal stability and cardinal stability, and investigate the computational complexity of finding an ordinally stable or cardinally stable fractional matching which either maximizes the social welfare (i.e., the overall utilities of the agents) or the number of fully matched agents (i.e., agents whose matching values sum up to one). We complete the complexity classification of both optimization problems for both ordinal stability and cardinal stability, distinguishing between the marriage (bipartite) and roommates (non-bipartite) cases and the presence or absence of ties in the preferences. In particular, we prove a surprising result that finding a cardinally stable fractional matching with maximum social welfare is NP-hard even for the marriage case without ties. This answers an open question and exemplifies a rare variant of stable marriage that remains hard for preferences without ties. We also complete the picture of the relations of the stability notions and derive structural properties.",

        "abstract": "Real-world networked systems often show dynamic properties with continuously evolving network nodes and topology over time. When learning from dynamic networks, it is beneficial to correlate all temporal networks to fully capture the similarity/relevance between nodes. Recent work for dynamic network representation learning typically trains each single network independently and imposes relevance regularization on the network learning at different time steps. Such a snapshot scheme fails to leverage topology similarity between temporal networks for progressive training. In addition to the static node relationships within each network, nodes could show similar variation patterns (e.g., change of local structures) within the temporal network sequence. Both static node structures and temporal variation patterns can be combined to better characterize node affinities for unified embedding learning. In this paper, we propose Graph Attention Evolving Networks (GAEN) for dynamic network embedding with preserved similarities between nodes  derived from their temporal variation patterns. Instead of training graph attention weights for each network independently, we allow model weights to share and evolve across all temporal networks based on their respective topology discrepancies. Experiments and validations, on four real-world dynamic graphs, demonstrate that GAEN outperforms the state-of-the-art in both link prediction and node classification tasks.",

Social cues greatly influence our attention, consequently altering our eye movements and behavior. \r\nTo emphasize the efficacy of such features, we present a neural model for integrating social cues and weighting their influences. Our model consists of two stages. During the first stage, we detect two social cues by following gaze, estimating gaze direction, and recognizing affect. These features are then transformed into spatiotemporal maps through image processing operations. The transformed representations are propagated to the second stage (GASP) where we explore various techniques of late fusion for integrating social cues and introduce two sub-networks for directing attention to relevant stimuli. Our experiments indicate that fusion approaches achieve better results for static integration methods, whereas non-fusion approaches for which the influence of each modality is unknown, result in better outcomes when coupled with recurrent models for dynamic saliency prediction. We show that gaze direction and affective representations contribute a prediction to ground-truth correspondence improvement of at least 5% compared to dynamic saliency models without social cues. Furthermore, affective representations improve GASP, supporting the necessity of considering affect-biased attention in predicting saliency.",

The key to deal with such problem is to mine the associations between image contents and labels, and further obtain the correct assignments between images and their labels. In this paper, we treat each image as a bag of instances, and reformulate the task of MLIC as a instance-label matching selection problem. To model such problem, we propose a novel deep learning framework named Graph Matching based Multi-Label Image Classification (GM-MLIC), where Graph Matching (GM) scheme is introduced owing to its excellent capability of excavating the instance and label relationship. Specifically,  we first construct an instance spatial graph and a label semantic graph respectively, and then incorporate them into a constructed assignment graph by connecting each instance to all labels. Subsequently, the graph network block is adopted to aggregate and update all nodes and edges state on the assignment graph to form structured representations for each instance and label. Our network finally derives a prediction score for each instance-label correspondence and optimizes such correspondence with a weighted cross-entropy loss.

        "abstract": "This paper explores a succinct kernel model for Group-Sparse Projections Learning (GSPL), to handle multiview feature selection task completely. Compared to previous works, our model has the following useful properties: 1) Strictness: GSPL innovatively learns group-sparse projections strictly on multiview data via \u20182;0-norm constraint, which is different with previous works that encourage group-sparse projections softly. 2) Adaptivity: In GSPL model, when the total number of selected features is given, the numbers of selected features of different views can be determined adaptively,\r\nwhich avoids artificial settings. Besides, GSPL can capture the differences among multiple views adaptively, which handles the inconsistent problem among different views. 3) Succinctness: Except for the intrinsic parameters of projection-based feature selection task, GSPL does not bring extra parameters, which guarantees the applicability in practice. To solve the optimization problem involved in GSPL, a novel iterative algorithm is proposed with rigorously theoretical guarantees. Experimental results demonstrate the superb performance of GSPL on synthetic and real datasets.",

        "abstract": "Public projects can succeed or fail for many reasons such as the feasibility of the original goal and coordination among contributors. One major reason for failure is that insufficient work leaves the project partially completed. For certain types of projects anything short of full completion is a failure (e.g., feature request on software projects in GitHub). Therefore, project success relies heavily on individuals allocating sufficient effort. When there are multiple public projects, each contributor needs to make decisions to best allocate his/her limited effort (e.g., time) to projects while considering the effort allocation decisions of other strategic contributors and his/her parameterized utilities based on values and costs for the projects. In this paper, we introduce a game-theoretic effort allocation model of contributors to public projects for modeling effort allocation of strategic contributors. We study the related Nash equilibrium (NE) computational problems and provide NP-hardness results for the existence of NE and polynomial-time algorithms for finding NE in restricted settings. Finally, we investigate the inefficiency of NE measured by the price of anarchy and price of stability.",

A natural notion of strength of alternatives in a tournament is a generalized king: an alternative is said to be a k-king if it can reach every other alternative in the tournament via a directed path of length at most k. In this paper, we provide an almost complete characterization of the probability threshold such that all, a large number, or a small number of alternatives are k-kings with high probability in two random models. We show that, perhaps surprisingly, all changes in the threshold occur in the regime of constant k, with the biggest change being between k = 2 and k = 3. In addition, we establish an asymptotically tight bound on the probability threshold for which all alternatives are likely able to win a single-elimination tournament under some bracket.",

Domain generalization deals with a challenging setting where one or several different but related domain(s) are given, and the goal is to learn a model that can generalize to an unseen test domain. For years, great progress has been achieved. This paper presents the first review for recent advances in domain generalization. First, we provide a formal definition of domain generalization and discuss several related fields. Then, we categorize recent algorithms into three classes and present them in detail: data manipulation, representation learning, and learning strategy, each of which contains several popular algorithms.

In this paper, we propose Generative Adversarial NAS (GA-NAS) with theoretically provable convergence guarantees, promoting stability and reproducibility in neural architecture search. Inspired by importance sampling, GA-NAS iteratively fits a generator to previously discovered top architectures, thus increasingly focusing on important parts of a large search space. Furthermore, we propose an efficient adversarial learning approach, where the generator is trained by reinforcement learning based on rewards provided by a discriminator, thus being able to explore the search space without evaluating a large number of architectures. Extensive experiments show that GA-NAS beats the best published results under several cases on three public NAS benchmarks. In the meantime, GA-NAS can handle ad-hoc search constraints and search spaces. We show that GA-NAS can be used to improve already optimized baselines found by other NAS methods, including EfficientNet and ProxylessNAS, in terms of ImageNet accuracy or the number of parameters, in their original search space.",

        "abstract": "Recent works show that mean-teaching is an effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptive person re-identification. However, existing methods perform contrastive learning on selected samples between teacher and student networks, which is sensitive to noises in pseudo labels and neglects the relationship among most samples. Moreover, these methods are not effective in cooperation of different teacher networks. To handle these issues, this paper proposes a Graph Consistency based Mean-Teaching (GCMT) method with constructing the Graph Consistency Constraint (GCC) between teacher and student networks. Specifically, given unlabeled training images, we apply teacher networks to extract corresponding features and further construct a teacher graph for each teacher network to describe the similarity relationships among training images. To boost the representation learning, different teacher graphs are fused to provide the supervise signal for optimizing student networks. GCMT fuses similarity relationships predicted by different teacher networks as supervision and effectively optimizes student networks with more sample relationships involved. Experiments on three datasets, i.e., Market-1501, DukeMTMCreID, and MSMT17, show that proposed GCMT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by clear margin. Specially, GCMT even outperforms the previous method that uses a deeper backbone. Experimental results also show that GCMT can effectively boost the performance with multiple teacher and student networks. Our code is available at https://github.com/liu-xb/GCMT .",

However, existing methods fail to consider the class information and will introduce false-negative samples in the random negative sampling, causing poor performance. To this end, we propose a graph debiased contrastive learning framework, which can jointly perform representation learning and clustering. Specifically, representations can be optimized by aligning with clustered class information, and simultaneously, the optimized representations can promote clustering, leading to more powerful representations and clustering results. More importantly, we randomly select negative samples from the clusters which are different from the positive sample's cluster. In this way, as the supervisory signals, the clustering results can be utilized to effectively decrease the false-negative samples. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on graph clustering and classification tasks.",

        "abstract": "Convolution learning on graphs draws increasing attention recently due to its potential applications to a large amount of irregular data. Most graph convolution methods leverage the plain summation/average aggregation to avoid the discrepancy of responses from isomorphic graphs. However, such an extreme collapsing way would result in a structural loss and signal entanglement of nodes, which further cause the degradation of the learning ability. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Graph Deformer Network (GDN) to fulfill anisotropic convolution filtering on graphs, analogous to the standard convolution operation on images. Local neighborhood subgraphs (acting like receptive fields) with different structures are deformed into a unified virtual space, coordinated by several anchor nodes. In the deformation process, we transfer components of nodes therein into affinitive anchors by learning their correlations, and build a multi-granularity feature space calibrated with anchors. Anisotropic convolutional kernels can be further performed over the anchor-coordinated space to well encode local variations of receptive fields. By parameterizing anchors and stacking coarsening layers, we build a graph deformer network in an end-to-end fashion. Theoretical analysis indicates its connection to previous work and shows the promising property of graph isomorphism testing. Extensive experiments on widely-used datasets validate the effectiveness of GDN in graph and node classifications.",

GED computation has known to be NP-hard and many heuristic methods are proposed. GED has two inherent characteristics: multiple optimum node matchings and one-to-one node matching constraints. However, these two characteristics have not been well considered in the existing learning-based methods, which leads to suboptimal models. In this paper, we propose a novel GED-specific loss function that simultaneously encodes the two characteristics. First, we propose an optimal partial node matching-based regularizer to encode multiple optimum node matchings. Second, we propose a plane intersection-based regularizer to impose the one-to-one constraints for the encoded node matchings.

        "abstract": "Graph representation learning has achieved great success in many areas, including e-commerce, chemistry, biology, etc. However, the fundamental problem of choosing the appropriate dimension of node embedding for a given graph still remains unsolved. The commonly used strategies for Node Embedding Dimension Selection (NEDS) based on grid search or empirical knowledge suffer from heavy computation and poor model performance. In this paper, we revisit NEDS from the perspective of minimum entropy principle. Subsequently, we propose a novel Minimum Graph Entropy (MinGE) algorithm for NEDS with graph data. To be specific, MinGE considers both feature entropy and structure entropy on graphs, which are carefully designed according to the characteristics of the rich information in them. The feature entropy, which assumes the embeddings of adjacent nodes to be more similar, connects node features and link topology on graphs. The structure entropy takes the normalized degree as basic unit to further measure the higher-order structure of graphs. Based on them, we design MinGE to directly calculate the ideal node embedding dimension for any graph. Finally, comprehensive experiments with popular Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed MinGE.",

        "abstract": "Graph clustering has become an important research topic due to the proliferation of graph data. However, existing methods suffer from two major drawbacks. On the one hand, most methods can not simultaneously exploit attribute and graph structure information. On the other hand, most methods are incapable of handling multi-view data which contain sets of different features and graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-view Attributed Graph Clustering (MvAGC) method, which is simple yet effective. Firstly, a graph filter is applied to features to obtain a smooth representation without the need of learning the parameters of neural networks. Secondly, a novel strategy is designed to select a few anchor points, so as to reduce the computation complexity. Thirdly, a new regularizer is developed to explore high-order neighborhood information. Our extensive experiments indicate that our method works surprisingly well with respect to state-of-the-art deep neural network methods.

GLRS mainly employ advanced graph learning approaches to model users\u2019 preferences and intentions as well as items\u2019 characteristics and popularity for Recommender Systems (RS). Differently from other approaches, including content based filtering and collaborative filtering, GLRS are built on graphs where the important objects, e.g., users, items, and attributes, are either explicitly or implicitly connected. With the rapid development of graph learning techniques, exploring and exploiting homogeneous or heterogeneous relations in graphs is a promising direction for building more effective RS. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of GLRS, by discussing how they extract knowledge from graphs to improve the accuracy, reliability and explainability of the recommendations. First, we characterize and formalize GLRS, and then summarize and categorize the key challenges and main progress in this novel research area.",

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks, while generalize well, are known to be sensitive to small adversarial perturbations. This phenomenon poses severe security threat and calls for in-depth investigation of the robustness of deep learning models. With the emergence of neural networks for graph structured data, similar investigations are urged to understand their robustness. It has been found that adversarially perturbing the graph structure and/or node features may result in a significant degradation of the model performance. In this work, we show from a different angle that such fragility similarly occurs if the graph contains a few bad-actor nodes, which compromise a trained graph neural network through flipping the connections to any targeted victim. Worse, the bad actors found for one graph model severely compromise other models as well. We call the bad actors ``anchor nodes'' and propose an algorithm, named GUA, to identify them. Thorough empirical investigations suggest an interesting finding that the anchor nodes often belong to the same class; and they also corroborate the intuitive trade-off between the number of anchor nodes and the attack success rate. For the dataset Cora which contains 2708 nodes, as few as six anchor nodes will result in an attack success rate higher than 80% for GCN and other three models.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) transfers knowledge from a teacher network to a student by enforcing the student to mimic the outputs of the pretrained teacher on training data. However, data samples are not always accessible in many cases due to large data sizes, privacy, or confidentiality. Many efforts have been made on addressing this problem for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) whose inputs lie in a grid domain within a continuous space such as images and videos, but largely overlook graph neural networks (GNNs) that handle non-grid data with different topology structures within a discrete space. The inherent differences between their inputs make these CNN-based approaches not applicable to GNNs. In this paper, we propose to our best knowledge the first dedicated approach to distilling knowledge from a GNN without graph data. The proposed graph-free KD (GFKD) learns graph topology structures for knowledge transfer by modeling them with multinomial distribution. We then introduce a gradient estimator to optimize this framework. Essentially, the gradients w.r.t. graph structures are obtained by only using GNN forward-propagation without back-propagation, which means that GFKD is compatible with modern GNN libraries such as DGL and Geometric. Moreover, we provide the strategies for handling different types of prior knowledge in the graph data or the GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GFKD achieves the state-of-the-art performance for distilling knowledge from GNNs without training data.",

Consequently, two nodes that are vastly distant but located in similar local neighborhoods map to similar embeddings in those networks. This limitation prevents accurate performance in predictive tasks that rely on position information. In this paper, we develop GRAPHREACH , a position-aware inductive GNN that captures the global positions of nodes through reachability estimations with respect to a set of anchor nodes. The anchors are strategically selected so that reachability estimations across all the nodes are maximized. We show that this combinatorial anchor selection problem is NP-hard and, consequently, develop a greedy (1\u22121/e) approximation heuristic. Empirical evaluation against state-of-the-art GNN architectures reveal that GRAPHREACH provides up to 40% relative improvement in accuracy. In addition, it is more robust to adversarial attacks.",

Our result holds even when separation constraints are imposed; however, in the latter case no multiplicative approximation of proportionality can be guaranteed. Furthermore, while maximin share fairness is not always achievable for general graphs, we prove that ordinal relaxations can be attained.",

        "abstract": "The maximin share (MMS) guarantee is a desirable fairness notion for allocating indivisible goods. While MMS allocations do not always exist, several approximation techniques have been developed to ensure that all agents receive a fraction of their maximin share. We focus on an alternative approximation notion, based on the population of agents, that seeks to guarantee MMS for a fraction of agents. We show that no optimal approximation algorithm can satisfy more than a constant number of agents, and discuss the existence and computation of MMS for all but one agent and its relation to approximate MMS guarantees. We then prove the existence of allocations that guarantee MMS for 2/3 of agents, and devise a polynomial time algorithm that achieves this bound for up to nine agents.  A key implication of our result is the existence of allocations that guarantee the value that an agent receives by partitioning the goods into 3n/2 bundles, improving the best known guarantee when goods are partitioned into 2n-2 bundles. Finally, we provide empirical experiments using synthetic data.",

        "abstract": "Concept extraction aims to find words or phrases describing a concept from massive texts. Recently, researchers propose many neural network-based methods to automatically extract concepts. Although these methods for this task show promising results, they ignore structured information in the raw textual data (e.g., title, topic, and clue words). In this paper, we propose a novel model, named Guided Attention Concept Extraction Network (GACEN), which uses  title, topic, and clue words as additional supervision to provide guidance directly. Specifically, GACEN comprises two attention networks, one of them is to gather the relevant title and topic information for each context word in the document. The other one aims to model the implicit connection between informative words (clue words) and concepts. Finally, we aggregate information from two networks as input to Conditional Random Field (CRF) to model dependencies in the output. We collected clue words for three well-studied datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms the baseline models with a large margin, especially when the labeled data is insufficient.",

        "abstract": "The longstanding goals of federated learning (FL) require rigorous privacy guarantees and low communication overhead while holding a relatively high model accuracy. However, simultaneously achieving all the goals is extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called hierarchical federated learning (H-FL) to tackle this challenge. Considering the degradation of the model performance due to the statistic heterogeneity of the training data, we devise a runtime distribution reconstruction strategy, which reallocates the clients appropriately and utilizes mediators to rearrange the local training of the clients. In addition, we design a compression-correction mechanism incorporated into H-FL to reduce the communication overhead while not sacrificing the model performance. To further provide privacy guarantees, we introduce differential privacy while performing local training, which injects moderate amount of noise into only part of the complete model. Experimental results show that our H-FL framework achieves the state-of-art performance on different datasets for the real-world image recognition tasks.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning has received significant attention. Most existing methods assume that all timestamps and corresponding graphs are available during training, which makes it difficult to predict future events. To address this issue, recent works learn to infer future events based on historical information. However, these methods do not comprehensively consider the latent patterns behind temporal changes, to pass historical information selectively, update representations appropriately and predict events accurately. In this paper, we propose the Historical Information Passing (HIP) network to predict future events. HIP network passes information from temporal, structural and repetitive perspectives, which are used to model the temporal evolution of events, the interactions of events at the same time step, and the known events respectively. In particular, our method considers the updating of relation representations and adopts three scoring functions corresponding to the above dimensions. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets show the superiority of HIP network, and the significant improvements on Hits@1 prove that our method can more accurately predict what is going to happen.",

Lifting exploits symmetries when dealing with large numbers of isomorphic random variables. It provides a more compact representation for more efficient query answering by encoding the symmetries using logical variables. This paper improves on an existing lifted representation of the joint distribution represented by a Gaussian Bayesian network (lifted joint), allowing overlaps between the logical variables. Handling overlaps without grounding a model is critical for modelling real-world scenarios.\r\nSpecifically, this paper contributes (i) a lifted joint that allows overlaps in logical variables and (ii) a lifted query answering algorithm using the lifted joint. Complexity analyses and experimental results show that - despite overlaps - constructing a lifted joint and answering queries on the lifted joint outperform their grounded counterparts significantly.",

In this survey on hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS), we present some of the existing answers proposed in the literature for the following questions: \"Is it possible to build an efficient DL model that meets the latency and energy constraints of tiny edge devices?\", \"How can we reduce the trade-off between the accuracy of a DL model and its ability to be deployed in a variety of platforms?\". The survey provides a new taxonomy of HW-NAS and assesses the hardware cost estimation strategies. We also highlight the challenges and limitations of existing approaches and potential future directions. \r\nWe hope that this survey will help to fuel the research towards efficient deep learning.",

        "abstract": "Most attempts on extending  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs)  implicitly take the direct assumption that the multiple homogeneous attributed networks induced by different meta-paths are complementary.  The doubts about the hypothesis of complementary motivate an alternative  assumption of consensus. That is, the aggregated node attributes shared by multiple homogeneous attributed networks are essential for node representations, while the specific ones in each homogeneous attributed network should be discarded. In this paper, a novel Heterogeneous Graph Information Bottleneck (HGIB) is proposed to implement the consensus hypothesis in an unsupervised manner. To this end, information bottleneck (IB) is extended to unsupervised representation learning  by leveraging self-supervision strategy.  Specifically, HGIB simultaneously maximizes the mutual information between   one homogeneous network and the representation learned from another homogeneous network, while minimizes the mutual information between the specific information contained in one homogeneous network and the representation learned from this homogeneous network. Model analysis reveals that the two extreme cases of HGIB correspond to the supervised heterogeneous GNN and the infomax on homogeneous graph, respectively. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that the consensus-based unsupervised HGIB significantly outperforms most semi-supervised SOTA methods based on complementary assumption.",

        "abstract": "Numerical vector aggregation has numerous applications in privacy-sensitive scenarios, such as distributed gradient estimation in federated learning, and statistical analysis on key-value data. Within the framework of local differential privacy, this work gives tight minimax error bounds of O(d s/(n epsilon^2)), where d is the dimension of the numerical vector and s is the number of non-zero entries. An attainable mechanism is then designed to improve from existing approaches suffering error rate of O(d^2/(n epsilon^2)) or O(d s^2/(n epsilon^2)). To break the error barrier in the local privacy, this work further consider privacy amplification in the shuffle model with anonymous channels, and shows the mechanism satisfies centralized (14 ln(2/delta) (s e^epsilon+2s-1)/(n-1))^0.5, delta)-differential privacy, which is domain independent and thus scales to federated learning of large models. We experimentally validate and compare it with existing approaches,  and demonstrate its significant error reduction.",

        "abstract": "Stock trend prediction is a challenging task due to the non-stationary dynamics and complex market dependencies. Existing methods usually regard each stock as isolated for prediction, or simply detect their correlations based on a fixed predefined graph structure. Genuinely, stock associations stem from diverse aspects, the underlying relation signals should be implicit in comprehensive graphs. On the other hand, the RNN network is mainly used to model stock historical data, while is hard to capture fine-granular volatility patterns implied in different time spans. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Adaptive Temporal-Relational Network (HATR) to characterize and predict stock evolutions. By stacking dilated causal convolutions and gating paths, short- and long-term transition features are gradually grasped from multi-scale local compositions of stock trading sequences. Particularly, a dual attention mechanism with Hawkes process and target-specific query is proposed to detect significant temporal points and scales conditioned on individual stock traits. Furthermore, we develop a multi-graph interaction module which consolidates prior domain knowledge and data-driven adaptive learning to capture interdependencies among stocks. All components are integrated seamlessly in a unified end-to-end framework. Experiments on three real-world stock market datasets validate the effectiveness of our model.",

        "abstract": "Classification algorithms in machine learning often assume a flat label space. However, most real world data have dependencies between the labels, which can often be captured by using a hierarchy. Utilizing this relation can help develop a model capable of satisfying the dependencies and improving model accuracy and interpretability. Further, as different levels in the hierarchy correspond to different granularities, penalizing each label equally can be detrimental to model learning. In this paper, we propose a loss function, hierarchical curriculum loss, with two properties: (i) satisfy hierarchical constraints present in the label space, and (ii) provide non-uniform weights to labels based on their levels in the hierarchy, learned implicitly by the training paradigm. We theoretically show that the proposed hierarchical class-based curriculum loss is a tight bound of 0-1 loss  among all losses satisfying the hierarchical constraints. We test our loss function on real world image data sets, and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",

An AkNN query retrieves k POIs with the smallest aggregate distances where the aggregate distance of a POI is obtained by aggregating its distances from the multiple agents (e.g., sum of its distances from each agent). We propose a novel data structure COLT (Compacted Object-Landmark Tree) which enables efficient hierarchical graph traversal and utilize it to efficiently answer AkNN queries.

        "abstract": "Fine-grained entity typing (FET) aims to annotate the entity mentions in a sentence with fine-grained type labels. It brings plentiful semantic information for many natural language processing tasks. Existing FET approaches apply hard attention to learn on the noisy labels, and ignore that those noises have structured hierarchical dependency. Despite their successes, these FET models are insufficient in modeling type hierarchy dependencies and handling label noises. In this paper, we directly tackle the structured noisy labels by combining a forward tree module and a backward tree module. Specifically, the forward tree formulates the informative walk that hierarchically represents the type distributions. The backward tree models the erroneous walk that learns the noise confusion matrix. Empirical studies on several benchmark data sets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

        "abstract": "Video Question Answering (Video QA) is a powerful testbed to develop new AI capabilities. This task necessitates learning to reason about objects, relations, and events across visual and linguistic domains in space-time. High-level reasoning demands lifting from associative visual pattern recognition to symbol like manipulation over objects, their behavior and interactions. Toward reaching this goal we propose an object-oriented reasoning approach in that video is abstracted as a dynamic stream of interacting objects. At each stage of the video event flow, these objects interact with each other, and their interactions are reasoned about with respect to the query and under the overall context of a video. This mechanism is materialized into a family of general-purpose neural units and their multi-level architecture called Hierarchical Object-oriented Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (HOSTR) networks. This neural model maintains the objects' consistent lifelines in the form of a hierarchically nested spatio-temporal graph. Within this graph, the dynamic interactive object-oriented representations are built up along the video sequence, hierarchically abstracted in a bottom-up manner, and converge toward the key information for the correct answer. The method is evaluated on multiple major Video QA datasets and establishes new state-of-the-arts in these tasks. Analysis into the model's behavior indicates that object-oriented reasoning is a reliable, interpretable and efficient approach to Video QA.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge distillation often involves how to define and transfer knowledge from teacher to student effectively. Although recent self-supervised contrastive knowledge achieves the best performance, forcing the network to learn such knowledge may damage the representation learning of the original class recognition task. We therefore adopt an alternative self-supervised augmented task to guide the network to learn the joint distribution of the original recognition task and self-supervised auxiliary task. It is demonstrated as a richer knowledge to improve the representation power without losing the normal classification capability. Moreover, it is incomplete that previous methods only transfer the probabilistic knowledge between the final layers. We propose to append several auxiliary classifiers to hierarchical intermediate feature maps to generate diverse self-supervised knowledge and perform the one-to-one transfer to teach the student network thoroughly. Our method significantly surpasses the previous SOTA SSKD with an average improvement of 2.56% on CIFAR-100 and an improvement of 0.77% on ImageNet across widely used network pairs.

        "abstract": "Video-based automatic assessment of a student's learning engagement on the fly can provide immense values for delivering personalized instructional services, a vehicle particularly important for massive online education. To train such an assessor, a major challenge lies in the collection of sufficient labels at the appropriate temporal granularity since a learner's engagement status may continuously change throughout a study session. Supplying labels at either frame or clip level incurs a high annotation cost. To overcome such a challenge, this paper proposes a novel hierarchical multiple instance learning (MIL) solution, which only requires labels anchored on full-length videos to learn to assess student engagement at an arbitrary temporal granularity and for an arbitrary duration in a study session. The hierarchical model mainly comprises a bottom module and a top module, respectively dedicated to learning the latent relationship between a clip and its constituent frames and that between a video and its constituent clips, with the constraints on the training stage that the average engagements of local clips is that of the video label. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we compare the performance of the proposed approach with that of several state-of-the-art peer solutions through extensive experiments.",

        "abstract": "Policy gradient methods are appealing in deep reinforcement learning but suffer from high variance of gradient estimate. To reduce the variance, the state value function is applied commonly. However, the effect of the state value function becomes limited in stochastic dynamic environments, where the unexpected state dynamics and rewards will increase the variance. In this paper, we propose to replace the state value function with a novel hindsight value function, which leverages the information from the future to reduce the variance of the gradient estimate for stochastic dynamic environments. Particularly, to obtain an ideally unbiased gradient estimate, we propose an information-theoretic approach, which optimizes the embeddings of the future to be independent of previous actions. In our experiments, we apply the proposed hindsight value function in stochastic dynamic environments, including discrete-action environments and continuous-action environments. Compared with the standard state value function, the proposed hindsight value function consistently reduces the variance, stabilizes the training, and improves the eventual policy.",

Most research on algorithmic decision-making solely centers on the algorithm's performance, while recent work that explores human-machine collaboration has framed the decision-making problems as classification tasks. In this paper, we first propose and then develop a solution for a novel human-machine collaboration problem in a bandit feedback setting. Our solution aims to exploit the human-machine complementarity to maximize decision rewards. We then extend our approach to settings with multiple human decision makers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods using both synthetic and real human responses, and find that our methods outperform both the algorithm and the human when they each make decisions on their own. We also show how personalized routing in the presence of multiple human decision-makers can further improve the human-machine team performance.",

        "abstract": "Temporal logics over finite traces, such as LTLf and its extension LDLf, have been adopted in several areas, including Business Process Management (BPM),  to check properties of processes whose executions have an unbounded, but finite, length. These logics express properties of single traces in isolation, however, especially in BPM it is also of interest to express properties over the entire log, i.e., properties that relate multiple traces of the log at once.  In the case of infinite-traces, HyperLTL has been proposed to express these ``hyper'' properties. In this paper, motivated by BPM, we introduce HyperLDLf, a logic that extends LDLf with the hyper features of HyperLTL. We provide a sound, complete and computationally optimal technique, based on DFAs manipulation, for the model checking problem in the relevant case where the set of traces (i.e., the log) is a regular language. We illustrate how this form of model checking can be used for verifying log of business processes and for advanced forms of process mining.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a hyperspectral band selection method via spatial-spectral weighted region-wise multiple graph fusion-based spectral clustering, referred to as RMGF briefly. Considering that different objects have different reflection characteristics, we use a superpixel segmentation algorithm to segment the first principal component of original hyperspectral image cube into homogeneous regions. For each superpixel, we construct a corresponding similarity graph to reflect the similarity between band pairs. Then, a multiple graph diffusion strategy with theoretical convergence guarantee is designed to learn a unified graph for partitioning the whole hyperspectral cube into several subcubes via spectral clustering. During the graph diffusion process, the spatial and spectral information of each superpixel are embedded to make spatial/spectral similar superpixels contribute more to each other. Finally, the band containing minimum noise in each subcube is selected to represent the whole subcube. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets to validate the superiority of the proposed method when compared with other state-of-the-art ones.",

Ultimately, more claims necessarily indicate that the insurance company has to spend much time assessing claims and decides how much compensation the claimant should receive, which is a highly professional process that involves many complex operations. Therefore, the insurance assessor's role is essential. However, for the junior assessor often lacking in practical experience, it is not easy to quickly handle such an online procedure. In order to alleviate assessors' cognitive workload, we propose an Intelligent Insurance Assessment System (IIAS) that helps effectively collect claimant information through online real-time conversation analysis. With the assistance of IIAS, the average time cost of the insurance assessment procedure is reduced from 55 minutes to 35 minutes.",

        "abstract": "3D semantic scene completion and 2D semantic segmentation are two tightly correlated tasks that are both essential for indoor scene understanding, because they predict the same semantic classes, using positively correlated high-level features. Current methods use 2D features extracted from early-fused RGB-D images for 2D segmentation to improve 3D scene completion. We argue that this sequential scheme does not ensure these two tasks fully benefit each other, and present an Iterative Mutual Enhancement Network (IMENet) to solve them jointly, which interactively refines the two tasks at the late prediction stage. Specifically, two refinement modules are developed under a unified framework for the two tasks. The first is a 2D Deformable Context Pyramid (DCP) module, which receives the projection from the current 3D predictions to refine the 2D predictions. In turn, a 3D Deformable Depth Attention (DDA) module is proposed to leverage the reprojected results from 2D predictions to update the coarse 3D predictions. This iterative fusion happens to the stable high-level features of both tasks at a late stage. Extensive experiments on NYU and NYUCAD datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed iterative late fusion scheme, and our approach outperforms the state of the art on both 3D semantic scene completion and 2D semantic segmentation.",

Much of this work assumes that norms are provided to agents, but some work has investigated how agents can identify the norms present in a society through observation and experience. However, the norm-identification techniques proposed in the literature often depend on a very specific and domain-specific representation of norms, or require that the possible norms can be enumerated in advance. This paper investigates the problem of identifying norm candidates from a normative language expressed as a probabilistic context-free grammar, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) search. We apply our technique to a simulated robot manipulator task and show that it allows effective identification of norms from observation.",

This survey addresses the extent to which these methods have been adequately evaluated, both psychologically and computationally, and quantifies the shortfalls occurring. For instance, only 21% of these methods have been user tested. Five key deficits in the evaluation of these methods are detailed and a roadmap, with standardised benchmark evaluations, is proposed to resolve the issues arising; issues, that currently effectively block scientific progress in this field.",

This premise is reasonable in domains wherein a high degree of consensus is easily possible for any given data record, e.g. in agreeing on whether an image contains an elephant or not. However, there are several domains wherein people disagree with each other on the appropriate label to assign to a record, e.g. whether a tweet is toxic. We argue that data labeling must be understood as a process with some degree of domain-dependent noise and that any claims of predictive prowess must be sensitive to the degree of this noise. We present a method for quantifying labeling noise in a particular domain wherein people are seen to disagree with their own past selves on the appropriate label to assign to a record: choices under prospect uncertainty. Our results indicate that `state-of-the-art' choice models of decisions from description, by failing to consider the intrinsic variability of human choice behavior, find themselves in the odd position of predicting humans' choices better than the same humans' own previous choices for the same problem.

        "abstract": "The constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is an important framework in artificial intelligence used to model e.g. qualitative reasoning problems such as Allen's interval algebra A. There is strong practical incitement to solve CSPs as efficiently as possible, and the classical complexity of temporal CSPs, including A, is well understood. However, the situation is more dire with respect to running time bounds of the form O(f(n)) (where n is the number of variables) where existing results gives a best theoretical upper bound 2^O(n * log n) which leaves a significant gap to the best (conditional) lower bound 2^o(n). In this paper we narrow this gap by presenting two novel algorithms for temporal CSPs based on dynamic programming. The first algorithm solves temporal CSPs limited to constraints of arity three in O(3^n) time, and we use this algorithm to solve A in O((1.5922n)^n) time. The second algorithm tackles A directly and solves it in O((1.0615n)^n), implying a remarkable improvement over existing methods since no previously published algorithm belongs to O((cn)^n) for any c. We also extend the latter algorithm to higher dimensions box algebras where we obtain the first explicit upper bound.",

        "abstract": "The Column Subset Selection Problem (CSSP) and the Nystrom method are among the leading tools for constructing interpretable low-rank approximations of large datasets by selecting a small but representative set of features or instances. A fundamental question in this area is: what is the cost of this interpretability, i.e., how well can a data subset of size k compete with the best rank k approximation? We develop techniques which exploit spectral properties of the data matrix to obtain improved approximation guarantees which go beyond the standard worst-case analysis. Our approach leads to significantly better bounds for datasets with known rates of singular value decay, e.g., polynomial or exponential decay. Our analysis also reveals an intriguing phenomenon: the cost of interpretability as a function of k may exhibit multiple peaks and valleys, which we call a multiple-descent curve. A lower bound we establish shows that this behavior is not an artifact of our analysis, but rather it is an inherent property of the CSSP and Nystrom tasks. Finally, using the example of a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, we show that both our improved bounds and the multiple-descent curve can be observed on real datasets simply by varying the RBF parameter.",

        "abstract": "Document context-aware machine translation remains challenging due to the lack of large-scale document parallel corpora. To make full use of source-side monolingual documents for context-aware NMT, we propose a Pre-training approach with Global Context (PGC). In particular, we first propose a novel self-supervised pre-training task, which contains two training objectives: (1) reconstructing the original sentence from a corrupted version; (2) generating a gap sentence from its left and right neighbouring sentences. Then we design a universal model for PGC which consists of a global context encoder, a sentence encoder and a decoder, with similar architecture to typical context-aware NMT models. We evaluate the effectiveness and generality of our pre-trained PGC model by adapting it to various downstream context-aware NMT models. Detailed experimentation on four different translation tasks demonstrates that our PGC approach significantly improves the translation performance of context-aware NMT. For example, based on the state-of-the-art SAN model, we achieve an averaged improvement of 1.85 BLEU scores and 1.59 Meteor scores on the four translation tasks.",

ALMA-Learning is decentralized, observes only own action/reward pairs, requires no inter-agent communication, and achieves near-optimal (<5% loss) and fair coordination in a variety of synthetic scenarios and a real-world meeting scheduling problem. The lightweight nature and fast learning constitute ALMA-Learning ideal for on-device deployment.",

        "abstract": "Most sequential recommendation models capture the features of consecutive items in a user-item interaction history. Though effective, their representation expressiveness is still hindered by the sparse learning signals. As a result, the sequential recommender is prone to make inconsistent predictions. In this paper, we propose a model, SSI, to improve sequential recommendation consistency with Self-Supervised Imitation. Precisely, we extract the consistency knowledge by utilizing three self-supervised pre-training tasks, where temporal consistency and persona consistency capture user-interaction dynamics in terms of the chronological order and persona sensitivities, respectively. Furthermore, to provide the model with a global perspective, global session consistency is introduced by maximizing the mutual information among global and local interaction sequences. Finally, to comprehensively take advantage of all three independent aspects of consistency-enhanced knowledge, we establish an integrated imitation learning framework. The consistency knowledge is effectively internalized and transferred to the student model by imitating the conventional prediction logit as well as the consistency-enhanced item representations. In addition, the flexible self-supervised imitation framework can also benefit other student recommenders. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that SSI effectively outperforms the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods.",

However, a major challenge in this task is the scarcity of high-quality parallel data which is stylized paired. To address this problem, we propose an iterative dual knowledge transfer framework that utilizes informal training data of machine translation and formality style transfer data to create large-scale stylized paired data, for the training of stylized machine translation model. Specifically, we perform bidirectional knowledge transfer between translation model and text style transfer model iteratively through knowledge distillation. Then, we further propose a data-refinement module to process the noisy synthetic parallel data generated during knowledge transfer. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an improvement over the existing best model by 5 BLEU points on MTFC dataset. Meanwhile, extensive analyses illustrate our method can also improve the accuracy of formality style transfer.",

        "abstract": "Due to different types of inputs, diverse text generation tasks may adopt different encoder-decoder frameworks. Thus most existing approaches that aim to improve the robustness of certain generation tasks are input-relevant, and may not work well for other generation tasks. Alternatively, in this paper we present a universal approach to enhance the language representation for text generation on the base of generic encoder-decoder frameworks. This is done from two levels. First, we introduce randomness by randomly masking some percentage of tokens on the decoder side when training the models. In this way, instead of using ground truth history context, we use its corrupted version to predict the next token. Then we propose an auxiliary task to properly recover those masked tokens. Experimental results on several text generation tasks including machine translation (MT), AMR-to-text generation, and image captioning show that the proposed approach can significantly improve over competitive baselines without using any task-specific techniques. This suggests the effectiveness and generality of our proposed approach.",

In this classic problem it is often assumed that agents specify only ordinal preferences over objects and the goal is to return a matching that satisfies some desirable property such as Pareto optimality or rank-maximality. However, agents may have cardinal utilities describing their preference intensities and ignoring this can result in welfare loss. We investigate how to elicit additional cardinal information from agents using simple threshold queries and use it in turn to design algorithms that return a matching satisfying a desirable matching property, while also achieving a good approximation to the optimal welfare among all matchings satisfying that property.  Overall, our results show how one can improve welfare by even non-adaptively asking  agents for just one bit of extra information per object.",

        "abstract": "One of the main aims of the methods developed for reasoning under inconsistency, in particular paraconsistent inference, is to derive informative conclusions from inconsistent bases. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on inconsistency measurement for defining non-monotonic paraconsistent consequence relations. The main idea consists in adapting properties of classical reasoning under consistency to inconsistent propositional bases by involving inconsistency measures (IM). We first exhibit interesting properties of our consequence relations. We then study situations where they bring about consequences that are always jointly consistent. In particular, we introduce a property of inconsistency measures that guarantees the consistency of the set of all entailed formulas. We also show that this property leads to several interesting properties of our IM-based consequence relations. Finally, we discuss relationships between our framework and well-known consequence relations that are based on maximal consistent subsets. In this setting, we establish direct connections between the latter and properties of inconsistency measures.",

        "abstract": "Key to the effectiveness of schedule-driven approaches to real-time traffic control is an ability to accurately predict when sensed vehicles will arrive at and pass through the intersection. Prior work in schedule-driven traffic control has assumed a static vehicle arrival model. However, this static predictive model ignores the fact that the queue count and the incurred delay should vary as different partial signal timing schedules (i.e., different possible futures) are explored during the online planning process. In this paper, we propose an alternative arrival time model that incorporates queueing dynamics into this forward search process for a signal timing schedule, to more accurately capture how the intersection\u2019s queues vary over time. As each search state is generated, an incremental queueing delay is dynamically projected for each vehicle. The resulting total queueing delay is then considered in addition to the cumulative delay caused by signal operations. We demonstrate the potential of this approach through microscopic traffic simulation of a real-world road network, showing a 10-15% reduction in average wait times over the schedule-driven traffic signal control system in heavy traffic scenarios.",

To address this challenge, we propose to identify the independence property between current action and future states in environments, which can be further leveraged to effectively reduce the variance of the advantage estimation. In particular, the recognized independence property can be naturally utilized to construct a novel importance sampling advantage estimator with close-to-zero variance even when the Monte-Carlo return signal yields a large variance. To further remove the risk of the high variance introduced by the new estimator, we combine it with existing Monte-Carlo estimator via a reward decomposition model learned by minimizing the estimation variance. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves higher sample efficiency compared with existing advantage estimation methods in complex environments.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces an algorithm for discovering implicit and delayed causal relations between events observed by a robot at regular or arbitrary times, with the objective of improving data-efficiency and interpretability of model-based reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. The proposed algorithm initially predicts observations with the Markov assumption, and incrementally introduces new hidden variables to explain and reduce the stochasticity of the observations. The hidden variables are memory units that keep track of pertinent past events. Such events are systematically identified by their information gains. A test of independence between inputs and mechanisms is performed to identify cases when there is a causal link between events and those when the information gain is due to confounding variables. The learned transition and reward models are then used in a Monte Carlo tree search for planning. Experiments on simulated and real robotic tasks, and the challenging 3D game Doom show that this method significantly improves over current RL techniques.",

        "abstract": "The selective visual attention mechanism in the human visual system (HVS) restricts the amount of information to reach visual awareness for perceiving natural scenes, allowing near real-time information processing with limited computational capacity. This kind of selectivity acts as an \u2018Information Bottleneck (IB)\u2019, which seeks a trade-off between information compression and predictive accuracy. However, such information constraints are rarely explored in the attention mechanism for deep neural networks (DNNs). In this paper, we propose an IB-inspired spatial attention module for DNN structures built for visual recognition. The module takes as input an intermediate representation of the input image, and outputs a variational 2D attention map that minimizes the mutual information (MI) between the attention-modulated representation and the input, while maximizing the MI between the attention-modulated representation and the task label. To further restrict the information bypassed by the attention map, we quantize the continuous attention scores to a set of learnable anchor values during training. Extensive experiments show that the proposed IB-inspired spatial attention mechanism can yield attention maps that neatly highlight the regions of interest while suppressing backgrounds, and bootstrap standard DNN structures for visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, fine-grained recognition, cross-domain classification). The attention maps are interpretable for the decision making of the DNNs as verified in the experiments. Our code is available at this https URL.",

However, due to the inherent different drawing techniques and aesthetic expressions of Chinese ink wash painting, existing methods either achieve poor temporal consistency or fail to transfer the key freehand brushstroke characteristics of Chinese ink wash painting. In this paper, we present a novel video style transfer framework for Chinese ink wash paintings. The two key ideas are a multi-frame fusion for temporal coherence and an instance-aware style transfer. The frame reordering and stylization based on reference frame fusion are proposed to improve temporal consistency. Meanwhile, the proposed method is able to adaptively leave the white spaces in the background and to select proper scales to extract features and depict the foreground subject by leveraging instance segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art style transfer methods in terms of both temporal coherence and visual quality.

By letting the agent acquire knowledge from its own experience, RL has been successfully applied to complex domains such as robotics. However, for non-trivial problems, training an RL agent can take very long periods of time. Lifelong machine learning (LML) is a learning setting in which the agent learns to solve tasks sequentially, by leveraging knowledge accumulated from previously solved tasks to learn better/faster in a new one. Most LML works heavily rely on the assumption that tasks are similar to each other. However, this may not be true for some domains with a high degree of task-diversity that could benefit from adopting a lifelong learning approach, e.g., service robotics. Therefore, in this research we will address the problem of learning to solve a sequence of RL heterogeneous tasks (i.e., tasks that differ in their state-action space).",

        "abstract": "Using personalized explanations to support recommendations has been shown to increase trust and perceived quality. However, to actually obtain better recommendations, there needs to be a means for users to modify the recommendation criteria by interacting with the explanation. We present a novel technique using aspect markers that learns to generate personalized explanations of recommendations from review texts, and we show that human users significantly prefer these explanations over those produced by state-of-the-art techniques.\r\n\r\nOur work's most important innovation is that it allows users to react to a recommendation by critiquing the textual explanation: removing (symmetrically adding) certain aspects they dislike or that are no longer relevant (symmetrically that are of interest). The system updates its user model and the resulting recommendations according to the critique. This is based on a novel unsupervised critiquing method for single- and multi-step critiquing with textual explanations. Empirical results show that our system achieves good performance in adapting to the preferences expressed in multi-step critiquing and generates consistent explanations.",

This data often comes from people via interactions such as labeling, providing rewards and punishments, and giving demonstrations or critiques. However, people's ability to provide high-quality data can be affected by human factors of an interaction, such as induced cognitive load and perceived usability. We show that these human factors differ significantly between interaction types. We first formalize interactions as a Markov Decision Process, and construct a taxonomy of these interactions to identify four archetypes: Showing, Categorizing, Sorting, and Evaluating. We then run a user study across two task domains. Our findings show that Evaluating interactions are more cognitively loading and less usable than the others, and Categorizing and Showing interactions are the least cognitively loading and most usable.",

It is also difficult for patients to record correct movements at home without the guidance from experienced physicians. To help patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease get better evaluation from in-home recorded movement videos, we developed an interactive video acquisition and learning system for clinical motor assessments. The system provides real-time guidance with multi-level body keypoint tracking and analysis to patients, which guarantees correct understanding and performing of clinical tasks. We tested its effectiveness on healthy subjects, and the efficiency and usability on patient groups.

        "abstract": "We investigate the computational complexity of finding temporally disjoint paths or walks in temporal graphs. There, the edge set changes over discrete time steps and a temporal path (resp. walk) uses edges that appear at monotonically increasing time steps. Two paths (or walks) are temporally disjoint if they never use the same vertex at the same time; otherwise, they interfere. This reflects applications in robotics, traffic routing, or finding safe pathways in dynamically changing networks.\r\n\r\nOn the one extreme, we show that on general graphs the problem is computationally hard. The \"walk version\" is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the number of routes. However, it is polynomial-time solvable for any constant number of walks. The \"path version\" remains NP-hard even if we want to find only two temporally disjoint paths. On the other extreme, restricting the input temporal graph to have a path as underlying graph, quite counterintuitively, we find NP-hardness in general but also identify natural tractable cases.",

The  crux  of  our  approach  lies in learning interpretable latent representations that can model the synthetic mechanism of the minority samples by using a generative adversarial network(GAN). A Bayesian regularizer is imposed to guide the GAN to extract a set of salient features that are either disentangled or intensionally entangled, with their  interplay  controlled  by  a  prescribed  structure, defined with human-in-the-loop. As such, our GAN enjoys an improved sample complexity, being able  to  synthesize  high-quality  minority  samples even if the sizes of minority classes are extremely small  during  training.   Empirical  studies  substantiate that our approach can empower simple classifiers  to  achieve  superior  imbalanced  classification performance over the state-of-the-art competitors and is robust across various imbalance settings.

        "abstract": "Cloud service providers, including Google, Amazon, and Alibaba, have now launched machine-learning-as-a-service (MLaaS) platforms, allowing clients to access sophisticated cloud-based machine learning models via APIs. Unfortunately, however, the commercial value of these models makes them alluring targets for theft, and their strategic position as part of the IT infrastructure of many companies makes them an enticing springboard for conducting further adversarial attacks. In this paper, we put forth a novel and effective attack strategy, dubbed InverseNet, that steals the functionality of black-box cloud-based models with only a small number of queries. The crux of the innovation is that, unlike existing model extraction attacks that rely on public datasets or adversarial samples, InverseNet constructs inversed training samples to increase the similarity between the extracted substitute model and the victim model. Further, only a small number of data samples with high confidence scores (rather than an entire dataset) are used to reconstruct the inversed dataset, which substantially reduces the attack cost. Extensive experiments conducted on three simulated victim models and Alibaba Cloud's commercially-available API demonstrate that InverseNet yields a model with significantly greater functional similarity to the victim model than the current state-of-the-art attacks at a substantially lower query budget.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge distillation uses both real hard labels and soft labels predicted by teacher model as supervision. Intuitively, we expect the soft label probabilities and hard label probabilities to be concordant. However, in the real knowledge distillations, we found critical rank violations between hard labels and soft labels for augmented samples. For example, for an augmented sample x = 0.7 * cat + 0.3 * panda, a meaningful soft label distribution should have the same rank: P(cat|x)>P(panda|x)>P(other|x). But real teacher models usually violate the rank: P(tiger|x)>P(panda|x)>P(cat|x). We attribute the rank violations to the increased difficulty of understanding augmented samples for the teacher model. Empirically, we found the violations injuries the knowledge transfer. In this paper, we denote eliminating rank violations in data augmentation for knowledge distillation as isotonic data augmentation (IDA). We use isotonic regression (IR) -- a classic statistical algorithm -- to eliminate the rank violations. We show that IDA can be modeled as a tree-structured IR problem and gives an O(c*log(c)) optimal algorithm, where c is the number of labels. In order to further reduce the time complexity of the optimal algorithm, we also proposed a GPU-friendly approximation algorithm with linear time complexity. We have verified on variant datasets and data augmentation baselines that (1) the rank violation is a general phenomenon for data augmentation in knowledge distillation. And (2) our proposed IDA algorithms effectively increases the accuracy of knowledge distillation by solving the ranking violations.",

Actually, monotonicity is one of the basic conditions in cognitive diagnosis theory, which assumes that student's proficiency is monotonic with the probability of giving the right response to a test item. However, few of previous methods consider the monotonicity during optimization. To this end, we propose Item Response Ranking framework (IRR), aiming at introducing pairwise learning into cognitive diagnosis to well model the monotonicity between item responses. Specifically, we first use an item specific sampling method to sample item responses and construct response pairs based on their partial order, where we propose the two-branch sampling methods to handle the unobserved responses. After that, we use a pairwise objective function to exploit the monotonicity in the pair formulation. In fact, IRR is a general framework which can be applied to most of contemporary cognitive diagnosis models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our method.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) has recently emerged as an efficacious scheme for learning compact deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite the promising results achieved, the rationale that interprets the behavior of KD has yet remained largely understudied. In this paper, we introduce a novel task-oriented attention model, termed as KDExplainer, to shed light on the working mechanism underlying the vanilla KD. At the heart of KDExplainer is a Hierarchical Mixture of Experts (HME), in which a multi-class classification is reformulated as a multi-task binary one. Through distilling knowledge from a free-form pre-trained DNN to KDExplainer, we observe that KD implicitly modulates the knowledge conflicts between different subtasks, and in reality has much more to offer than label smoothing. Based on such findings, we further introduce a portable tool, dubbed as virtual attention module (VAM), that can be seamlessly integrated with various DNNs to enhance their performance under KD. Experimental results demonstrate that with a negligible additional cost, student models equipped with VAM consistently outperform their non-VAM counterparts across different benchmarks. Furthermore, when combined with other KD methods, VAM remains competent in promoting results, even though it is only motivated by vanilla KD. The code is available at https:// github.com/zju-vipa/KDExplainer.",

        "abstract": "This paper is part of an ongoing endeavor to bring the theory of fair division closer to practice by handling requirements from real-life applications. We focus on two requirements originating from the division of land estates: (1) each agent should receive a plot of a usable geometric shape, and (2) plots of different agents must be physically separated. With these requirements, the classic fairness notion of proportionality is impractical, since it may be impossible to attain any multiplicative approximation of it. In contrast, the ordinal maximin share approximation, introduced by Budish in 2011, provides meaningful fairness guarantees. We prove upper and lower bounds on achievable maximin share guarantees when the usable shapes are squares, fat rectangles, or arbitrary axes-aligned rectangles, and explore the algorithmic and query complexity of finding fair partitions in this setting.",

        "abstract": "Traditional end-to-end semantic parsing models treat a natural language utterance as a holonomic structure. However, hierarchical structures exist in natural languages, which also align with the hierarchical structures of logical forms. In this paper, we propose a latent shift-reduce parser, called LASP, which decomposes both natural language queries and logical form expressions according to their hierarchical structures and finds local alignment between them to enhance semantic parsing. LASP consists of a base parser and a shift-reduce splitter. The splitter dynamically separates an NL query into several spans. The base parser converts the relevant simple spans into logical forms, which are further combined to obtain the final logical form. We conducted empirical studies on two datasets across different domains and different types of logical forms. The results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of semantic parsing, especially on unseen scenarios.",

But social preference functions such as Kemeny rule output a full ranking of the candidates (a consensus). We study the complexity of consensus-related questions, with a particular focus on Kemeny and its qualitative version Slater. The simplest of these questions is the problem of determining whether a ranking is a consensus, and we show that this problem is coNP-complete. We also study the natural question of the complexity of manipulative actions that have a specific consensus as a goal. Though determining whether a ranking is a Kemeny consensus is hard, the optimal action for manipulators is to simply vote their desired consensus. We provide evidence that this simplicity is caused by the combination of election system (Kemeny), manipulative action (manipulation), and manipulative goal (consensus). In the process we provide the first completeness results at the second level of the polynomial hierarchy for electoral manipulation and for optimal solution recognition.",

Keyword-based exploration is a convenient paradigm, and computing a group Steiner tree (GST) as an answer is a popular implementation. Recent studies suggested improving the cohesiveness of an answer where entities have small semantic distances from each other. However, how to efficiently compute such an answer is open. In this paper, to model cohesiveness in a generalized way, the quadratic group Steiner tree problem (QGSTP) is formulated where the cost function extends GST with quadratic terms representing semantic distances. For QGSTP we design a branch-and-bound best-first (B3F) algorithm where we exploit combinatorial methods to estimate lower bounds for costs. This exact algorithm shows practical performance on medium-sized KGs.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel approach for class incremental online learning in a limited data setting. This problem setting is challenging because of the following constraints: (1) Classes are given incrementally, which necessitates a class incremental learning approach; (2)  Data for each class is given in an online fashion, i.e., each training example is seen only once during training; (3) Each class has very few training examples; and (4) We do not use or assume access to any replay/memory to store data from previous classes. Therefore, in this setting, we have to handle twofold problems of catastrophic forgetting and overfitting. In our approach, we learn robust representations that are generalizable across tasks without suffering from the problems of catastrophic forgetting and overfitting to accommodate future classes with limited samples. Our proposed method leverages the meta-learning framework with knowledge consolidation. The meta-learning framework helps the model for rapid learning when samples appear in an online fashion. Simultaneously, knowledge consolidation helps to learn a robust representation against forgetting under online updates to facilitate future learning. Our approach significantly outperforms other methods on several benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Due to limited knowledge carried by queries, traditional dialogue systems often face the dilemma of generating boring responses, leading to poor user experience. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a novel infobox knowledge-aware dialogue generation approach, HITA-Graph, with three unique features. First, open-domain infobox tables that describe entities with relevant attributes are adopted as the knowledge source. An order-irrelevance Hierarchical Infobox Table Encoder is proposed to represent an infobox table at three levels of granularity. In addition, an Infobox-Dialogue Interaction Graph Network is built to effectively integrate the infobox context and the dialogue context into a unified infobox representation. Second, a Hierarchical Infobox Attribute Attention mechanism is developed to  access the encoded infobox knowledge at different levels of granularity. Last but not least, a Dynamic Mode Fusion strategy is designed to allow the Decoder to select a vocabulary word or copy a word from the given infobox/query. We extract infobox tables from Chinese Wikipedia and construct an infobox knowledge base. Extensive evaluation on an open-released Chinese corpus demonstrates the superior performance of our approach against several representative methods.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Training deep learning models on sensitive user data has raised increasing privacy concerns in many areas. Federated learning is a popular approach for privacy protection that collects the local gradient information instead of raw data. One way to achieve a strict privacy guarantee is to apply local differential privacy into federated learning. However, previous works do not give a practical solution due to two issues. First, the range difference of weights in different deep learning model layers has not been explicitly considered when applying local differential privacy mechanism. Second, the privacy budget explodes due to the high dimensionality of weights in deep learning models and many query iterations of federated learning. In this paper, we proposed a novel design of local differential privacy mechanism for federated learning to address the abovementioned issues. It makes the local weights update differentially private by adapting to the varying ranges at different layers of a deep neural network, which introduces a smaller variance of the estimated model weights, especially for deeper models. Moreover, the proposed mechanism bypasses the curse of dimensionality by parameter shuffling aggregation. A series of empirical evaluations on three commonly used datasets in prior differential privacy works, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10, demonstrate that our solution can not only achieve superior deep learning performance but also provide a strong privacy guarantee at the same time.",

        "abstract": "Decision-making policies for agents are often synthesized with the constraint that a  formal specification of behaviour is satisfied. Here we focus on infinite-horizon properties. On the one hand,  Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is a popular example of a formalism for qualitative specifications. On the other hand, Steady-State Policy Synthesis (SSPS) has recently received considerable attention as it provides a more quantitative and more behavioural perspective on specifications, in terms of the frequency with which states are visited. Finally, rewards provide a classic framework for quantitative properties.\r\nIn this paper, we study Markov decision processes (MDP) with the specification combining all these three types. The derived policy maximizes the reward among all policies ensuring the LTL specification with the given probability and adhering to the steady-state constraints. To this end, we provide a unified solution reducing the multi-type specification to a multi-dimensional long-run average reward. This is enabled by Limit-Deterministic B\u00fcchi Automata (LDBA), recently studied in the context of LTL model checking on MDP, and allows for an elegant solution through a simple linear programme. The algorithm also extends to the general omega-regular properties and runs in time polynomial in the sizes of the MDP as well as the LDBA.",

Unfortunately, most existing models cannot handle the text data with network links, such as web pages with hyperlinks and scientific papers with citations. To resolve this kind of data, we develop a novel neural topic model , namely Layer-Assisted Neural Topic Model (LANTM), which can be interpreted from the perspective of variational auto-encoders. Our major motivation is to enhance the topic representation encoding by not only using text contents, but also the assisted network links. Specifically, LANTM encodes the texts and network links to the topic representations by an augmented network with graph convolutional modules, and decodes them by maximizing the likelihood of the generative process. The neural variational inference is adopted for efficient inference. Experimental results validate that LANTM significantly outperforms the existing  models on topic quality, text classification and link prediction..",

        "abstract": "Human beings have a great generalization ability to recognize a novel category by only seeing a few number of samples. This is because humans possess the ability to learn from the concepts that already exist in our minds. However, many existing few-shot approaches fail in addressing such a fundamental problem, {\\it i.e.,} how to utilize the knowledge learned in the past to improve the prediction for the new task. In this paper, we present a novel purified memory mechanism that simulates the recognition process of human beings. This new memory updating scheme enables the model to purify the information from semantic labels and progressively learn consistent, stable, and expressive concepts when episodes are trained one by one. On its basis, a Graph Augmentation Module (GAM) is introduced to aggregate these concepts and knowledge learned from new tasks via a graph neural network, making the prediction more accurate. Generally, our approach is model-agnostic and computing efficient with negligible memory cost. Extensive experiments performed on several benchmarks demonstrate the proposed method can consistently outperform a vast number of state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods.",

During pairing, we then adopt Biaffine and Triaffine scoring for high-order aspect-opinion term pairing, in the meantime re-harnessing the syntax-enriched representations in LAGCN for syntactic-aware scoring.

To improve classification performance and solve the objective mismatch, we propose  a new LDL algorithm called LDL-HR. LDL-HR provides a new perspective of label distribution, \\textit{i.e.}, a combination of the \\textbf{highest label} and the \\textbf{rest label description degrees}.   \r\n  It works as follows. First, we learn the highest label by fitting the degenerated label distribution and large margin. Second, we learn the rest label description degrees to exploit generalization. Theoretical analysis shows the generalization of LDL-HR. Besides, the experimental results on 18 real-world datasets validate the statistical superiority of our method.",

        "abstract": "In many public health settings, it is important for patients to adhere to health programs, such as taking medications and periodic health checks. Unfortunately, beneficiaries may gradually disengage from such programs, which is detrimental to their health. A concrete example of gradual disengagement has been observed by an organization that carries out a free automated call-based program for spreading preventive care information among pregnant women. Many women stop picking up calls after being enrolled for a few months. To avoid such disengagements, it is important to provide timely interventions. Such interventions are often expensive and can be provided to only a small fraction of the beneficiaries. We model this scenario as a restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) problem, where each beneficiary is assumed to transition from one state to another depending on the intervention.  Moreover, since the transition probabilities are unknown a priori, we propose a Whittle index based Q-Learning mechanism and show that it converges to the optimal solution. Our method improves over existing learning-based methods for RMABs on multiple benchmarks from literature and also on the maternal healthcare dataset.",

        "abstract": "3-D human pose estimation is a crucial step for understanding human actions. However, reliably capturing precise 3-D position of human joints is non-trivial and tedious. Current models often suffer from the scarcity of high-quality 3-D annotated training data. In this work, we explore a novel way of obtaining gigantic 3-D human pose data without manual annotations. In catedioptric videos (\\emph{e.g.}, people dance before a mirror), the camera records both the original and mirrored human poses, which provides cues for estimating 3-D positions of human joints. Following this idea, we crawl a large-scale Dance-before-Mirror (DBM) video dataset, which is about 24 times larger than existing Human3.6M benchmark. Our technical insight is that, by jointly harnessing the epipolar geometry and human skeleton priors, 3-D joint estimation can boil down to an optimization problem over two sets of 2-D estimations. To our best knowledge, this represents the first work that collects high-quality 3-D human data via catadioptric systems. We have conducted comprehensive experiments on cross-scenario pose estimation and visualization analysis. The results strongly demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed DBM human poses.",

Typically, representations over sets are computed by using fixed aggregation functions such as sum or maximum. However, recent results showed that universal function representation by sum- (or max-) decomposition requires either highly discontinuous (and thus poorly learnable) mappings, or a latent dimension equal to the maximum number of elements in the set. To mitigate this problem, we introduce LAF (Learning Aggregation Function), a learnable aggregator for sets of arbitrary cardinality. LAF can approximate several extensively used aggregators (such as average, sum, maximum) as well as more complex functions (e.g. variance and skewness). We report experiments on semi-synthetic and real data showing that LAF outperforms state-of-the-art sum- (max-) decomposition architectures such as DeepSets and library-based architectures like Principal Neighborhood Aggregation, and can be effectively combined with attention-based architectures.",

        "abstract": "Constructing appropriate representations of molecules lies at the core of numerous tasks such as material science, chemistry, and drug designs. Recent researches abstract molecules as attributed graphs and employ graph neural networks (GNN) for molecular representation learning, which have made remarkable achievements in molecular graph modeling. Albeit powerful, current models either are based on local aggregation operations and thus miss higher-order graph properties or focus on only node information without fully using the edge information. For this sake, we propose a Communicative Message Passing Transformer (CoMPT) neural network to improve the molecular graph representation by reinforcing message interactions between nodes and edges based on the Transformer architecture. Unlike the previous transformer-style GNNs that treat molecule as a fully connected graph, we introduce a message diffusion mechanism to leverage the graph connectivity inductive bias and reduce the message enrichment explosion. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed model obtained superior performances (around 4% on average) against state-of-the-art baselines on seven chemical property datasets (graph-level tasks) and two chemical shift datasets (node-level tasks). Further visualization studies also indicated a better representation capacity achieved by our model.",

        "abstract": "We revisit the problem of learning logical theories from examples, one of the most quintessential problems in machine learning. More specifically, we develop an approach to learn CNF-formulae from satisfiability. This is a setting in which the examples correspond to partial interpretations and an example is classified as positive when it is logically consistent with the theory.\r\nWe present a novel algorithm, called Mistle -- Minimal SAT Theory Learner, for learning such theories. The distinguishing features are that 1) Mistle performs predicate invention and inverse resolution, 2) is based on the MDL principle to compress the data, and 3) combines this with frequent pattern mining to find the most interesting theories. \r\nThe experiments demonstrate that Mistle can learn CNF theories accurately and works well in tasks involving compression and classification.",

        "abstract": "Zero-shot intent detection (ZSID) aims to deal with the continuously emerging intents without annotated training data. However, existing ZSID systems suffer from two limitations: 1) They are not good at modeling the relationship between seen and unseen intents. 2) They cannot effectively recognize unseen intents under the generalized intent detection (GZSID) setting. A critical problem behind these limitations is that the representations of unseen intents cannot be learned in the training stage. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that utilizes unseen class labels to learn Class-Transductive Intent Representations (CTIR). Specifically, we allow the model to predict unseen intents during training, with the corresponding label names serving as input utterances. On this basis, we introduce a multi-task learning objective, which encourages the model to learn the distinctions among intents, and a similarity scorer, which estimates the connections among intents more accurately. CTIR is easy to implement and can be integrated with existing ZSID and GZSID methods. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that CTIR brings considerable improvement to the baseline systems.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Different from popular neural networks using quasiconvex activations, non-monotonic networks activated by periodic nonlinearities have emerged as a more competitive paradigm, offering revolutionary benefits: 1) compactly characterizing high-frequency patterns; 2) precisely representing high-order derivatives. Nevertheless, they are also well-known for being hard to train, due to easily over-fitting dissonant noise and only allowing for tiny architectures (shallower than 5 layers). The fundamental bottleneck is that the periodicity leads to many poor and dense local minima in solution space. The direction and norm of gradient oscillate continually during error backpropagation. Thus non-monotonic networks are prematurely stuck in these local minima, and leave out effective error feedback. To alleviate the optimization dilemma, in this paper, we propose a non-trivial soft transfer approach. It smooths their solution space close to that of monotonic ones in the beginning, and then improve their representational properties by transferring the solutions from the neural space of monotonic neurons to the Fourier space of non-monotonic neurons as the training continues. The soft transfer consists of two core components: 1) a rectified concrete gate is constructed to characterize the state of each neuron; 2) a variational Bayesian learning framework is proposed to dynamically balance the empirical risk and the intensity of transfer. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that the soft transfer not only reduces the risk of non-monotonic networks on over-fitting noise, but also helps them scale to much deeper architectures (more than 100 layers) achieving the new state-of-the-art performance.",

We approach the problem from a generalized planning perspective and learn first-order-like formulas that characterize unsolvability for entire planning domains. We show how to cast the problem as a self-supervised classification task. Our training data is automatically generated and labeled by exhaustive exploration of small instances of each domain, and candidate features are automatically computed from the predicates used to define the domain. We investigate three learning algorithms with different properties and compare them to heuristics from the literature. Our empirical results show that our approach often captures important classes of unsolvable states with high classification accuracy. Additionally, the logical form of our heuristics makes them easy to interpret and reason about, and can be used to show that the characterizations learned in some domains capture exactly all unsolvable states of the domain.",

However, it is particularly challenging to learn a class-invariant  spatial-temporal representation in such a setting. To address this, we propose a novel matching-based few-shot learning strategy for video sequences in this work. Our main idea is to introduce an implicit temporal alignment for a video pair, capable of estimating the similarity between them in an accurate and robust manner. Moreover, we design an effective context encoding module to incorporate spatial and feature channel context, resulting in better modeling of intra-class variations. To train our model, we develop a multi-task loss for learning video matching, leading to video features with better generalization. Extensive experimental results on two challenging benchmarks, show that our method outperforms the prior arts with a sizable margin on Something-Something-V2 and competitive results on Kinetics.",

Numerous conventional methods appeal to heuristics without any assurances of robustness. While probably approximately correct (PAC) Semantics offers strong guarantees, learning explicit representations is not tractable, even in propositional logic. However, recent work on so-called \u201cimplicit\" learning has shown tremendous promise in terms of obtaining polynomial-time results for fragments of first-order logic. In this work, we extend implicit learning in PAC-Semantics to handle noisy data in the form of intervals and threshold uncertainty in the language of linear arithmetic. We prove that our extended framework keeps the existing polynomial-time complexity guarantees. Furthermore, we provide the first empirical investigation of this hitherto purely theoretical framework. Using benchmark problems, we show that our implicit approach to learning optimal linear programming objective constraints significantly outperforms an explicit approach in practice.",

We achieve this through a novel regularization strategy that forces filters in the same group to be active in similar image regions for a given layer. We additionally use a regularizer to encourage a sparse weighting of the concept groups in each layer so that a few concept groups can have greater importance than others. We quantitatively evaluate CGL's model interpretability using standard interpretability evaluation techniques and find that our method increases interpretability scores in most cases. Qualitatively we compare the image regions which are most active under filters learned using CGL versus filters learned without CGL and find that CGL activation regions more strongly concentrate around semantically relevant features.",

        "abstract": "For meshes, sharing the topology of a template is a common and practical setting in face-, hand-, and body-related applications. Meshes are irregular since each vertex's neighbors are unordered and their orientations are inconsistent with other vertices. Previous methods use isotropic filters or predefined local coordinate systems or learning weighting matrices for each vertex of the template to overcome the irregularity. Learning weighting matrices for each vertex to soft-permute the vertex's neighbors into an implicit canonical order is an effective way to capture the local structure of each vertex. However, learning weighting matrices for each vertex increases the parameter size linearly with the number of vertices and large amounts of parameters are required for high-resolution 3D shapes. In this paper, we learn spectral dictionary (i.e., bases) for the weighting matrices such that the parameter size is independent of the resolution of 3D shapes. The coefficients of the weighting matrix bases for each vertex are learned from the spectral features of the template's vertex and its neighbors in a weight-sharing manner. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model produces state-of-the-art results with a much smaller model size.",

        "abstract": "Role-based network embedding methods aim to preserve node-centric connectivity patterns, which are expressions of node roles, into low-dimensional vectors. However, almost all the existing methods are designed for capturing a relaxation of automorphic equivalence or regular equivalence. They may be good at structure identification but could show poorer performance on role identification. Because automorphic equivalence and regular equivalence strictly tie the role of a node to the identities of all its neighbors. To mitigate this problem, we construct a framework called Curvature-based Network Embedding with Stochastic Equivalence (CNESE) to embed stochastic equivalence. More specifically, we estimate the role distribution of nodes based on discrete Ricci curvature for its excellent ability to concisely representing local topology. We use a Variational Auto-Encoder to generate embeddings while a degree-guided regularizer and a contrastive learning regularizer are leveraged to improving both its robustness and discrimination ability. The effectiveness of our proposed CNESE is demonstrated by extensive experiments on real-world networks.",

Here we explore the possibility to learn preferences from example plans. Focusing on one preference at a time, the user is asked to annotate examples as good/bad. We leverage prior work on LTL formula learning to extract a preference from these examples. We conduct an empirical study of this approach in an oversubscription planning context, using hidden target formulas to emulate the user preferences. We explore four different methods for generating example plans, and evaluate performance as a function of domain and formula size. Overall, we find that reasonable-size target formulas can often be learned effectively.",

        "abstract": "The study of multi-type Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) is fundamental for understanding biological processes from a systematic perspective and revealing disease mechanisms. Existing methods suffer from significant performance degradation when tested in unseen dataset. In this paper, we investigate the problem and find that it is mainly attributed to the poor performance for inter-novel-protein interaction prediction. However, current evaluations overlook the inter-novel-protein interactions, and thus fail to give an instructive assessment. As a result, we propose to address the problem from both the evaluation and the methodology. Firstly, we design a new evaluation framework that fully respects the inter-novel-protein interactions and gives consistent assessment across datasets. Secondly, we argue that correlations between proteins must provide useful information for analysis of novel proteins, and based on this, we propose a graph neural network based method (GNN-PPI) for better inter-novel-protein interaction prediction. Experimental results on real-world datasets of different scales demonstrate that GNN-PPI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PPI prediction methods, especially for the inter-novel-protein interaction prediction.",

        "abstract": "Current weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods with image-level labels mainly adopt class activation maps (CAM) to generate the initial pseudo labels. However, CAM usually only identifies the most discriminative object extents, which is attributed to the fact that the network doesn't need to discover the integral object to recognize image-level labels. In this work, to tackle this problem, we proposed to simultaneously learn the image-level labels and local visual word labels. Specifically, in each forward propagation, the feature maps of the input image will be encoded to visual words with a learnable codebook. By enforcing the network to classify the encoded fine-grained visual words, the generated CAM could cover more semantic regions. Besides, we also proposed a hybrid spatial pyramid pooling module that could preserve local maximum and global average values of feature maps, so that more object details and less background were considered. Based on the proposed methods, we conducted experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. Our proposed method achieved 67.2% mIoU on the val set and 67.3% mIoU on the test set, which outperformed recent state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "We develop a new framework for designing truthful, high-revenue (combinatorial) auctions for limited supply. Our mechanism learns within an instance. It generalizes and improves over previously-studied random-sampling mechanisms. It first samples a participatory group of bidders, then samples several learning groups of bidders from the remaining pool of bidders, learns a high-revenue auction from the learning groups, and finally runs that auction on the participatory group. Previous work on random-sampling mechanisms focused primarily on unlimited supply. Limited supply poses additional significant technical challenges, since allocations of items to bidders must be feasible. We prove guarantees on the performance of our mechanism based on a market-shrinkage term and a new complexity measure we coin partition discrepancy. Partition discrepancy simultaneously measures the intrinsic complexity of the mechanism class and the uniformity of the set of bidders. We then introduce new auction classes that can be parameterized in a way that does not depend on the number of bidders participating, and prove strong guarantees for these classes. We show how our mechanism can be implemented efficiently by leveraging practically-efficient routines for solving winner determination. Finally, we show how to use structural revenue maximization to decide what auction class to use with our framework when there is a constraint on the number of learning groups.",

Unfortunately, conservation efforts in green security domains are constrained by the limited availability of defenders, who must patrol vast areas to protect from attackers. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been developed for green security and other security settings, such as US Coast Guard patrols and airport screenings, but effective deployment of AI in these settings requires learning adversarial behavior and planning in complex environments where the true dynamics may be unknown. My research develops novel techniques in machine learning and game theory to enable the effective development and deployment of AI in these resource-constrained settings. Notably, my work has spanned the pipeline from learning in a supervised setting, planning in stochastic environments, sequential planning in uncertain environments, and deployment in the real world. The overarching goal is to optimally allocate scarce resources under uncertainty for environmental conservation.",

By decoupling a label vector into complementary labels and partial unknown labels, we simultaneously inhibit the outputs of complementary labels with a complementary loss and penalize the sensitivity of the classifier on the partial outputs of these unknown classes by consistency regularization. Then we unify the complementary loss and consistency loss together by a specially designed dynamic weighting factor.

        "abstract": "We study learning dynamics in distributed production economies such as blockchain mining, peer-to-peer file sharing and crowdsourcing. These economies can be modelled as multi-product Cournot competitions or all-pay auctions (Tullock contests) when individual firms have market power, or as Fisher markets with quasi-linear utilities when every firm has negligible influence on market outcomes. In the former case, we provide a formal proof that Gradient Ascent (GA) can be Li-Yorke chaotic for a step size as small as \u0398(1/n), where n is the number of firms. In stark contrast, for the Fisher market case, we derive a Proportional Response (PR) protocol that converges to market equilibrium. The positive results on the convergence of the PR dynamics are obtained in full generality, in the sense that they hold for Fisher markets with any quasi-linear utility functions. Conversely, the chaos results for the GA dynamics are established even in the simplest possible setting of two firms and one good, and they hold for a wide range of price functions with different demand elasticities. Our findings suggest that by considering multi-agent interactions from a market rather than a game-theoretic perspective, we can formally derive natural learning protocols which are stable and converge to effective outcomes rather than being chaotic.",

However, current VAs detection methods count on a variety of heuristic detection criteria, and require frequent manual interventions to personalize criteria parameters for each patient to achieve accurate detection. In this work, we propose a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) based life-threatening VAs detection on IEGMs. The network architecture is elaborately designed to satisfy the extreme resource constraints of the ICD while maintaining high detection accuracy. We further propose a meta-learning algorithm with a novel patient-wise training tasks formatting strategy to personalize the 1D-CNN. The algorithm generates a well-generalized model initialization containing across-patient knowledge, and performs a quick adaptation of the model to the specific patient's IEGMs. In this way, a new patient could be immediately assigned with personalized 1D-CNN model parameters using limited input data.

        "abstract": "In ad-hoc teamwork, an agent is required to cooperate with unknown teammates without prior coordination. To swiftly adapt to an unknown teammate, most works adopt a type-based approach, which pre-trains the agent with a set of pre-prepared teammate types, then associates the unknown teammate with a particular type. Typically, these types are collected manually. This hampers previous works by both the availability and diversity of types they manage to obtain. To eliminate these limitations, this work addresses to achieve ad-hoc teamwork in a type-free approach. Specifically, we propose the model of Entropy-regularized Deep Recurrent Q-Network (EDRQN) to generate teammates automatically, meanwhile utilize them to pre-train our agent. These teammates are obtained from scratch and are designed to perform the task with various behaviors, therefore their availability and diversity are both ensured. We evaluate our model on several benchmark domains of ad-hoc teamwork. The result shows that even if our model has no access to any pre-prepared teammate types, it still achieves significant performance.",

However, many practical scenarios do not always require the system to remember all of the past knowledge. Instead, ethical considerations call for selective and proactive forgetting of undesirable knowledge in order to prevent privacy issues and data leakage. In this paper, we propose a new framework for lifelong learning, called Learning with Selective Forgetting, which is to update a model for the new task with forgetting only the selected classes of the previous tasks while maintaining the rest. The key is to introduce a class-specific synthetic signal called mnemonic code. The codes are \"watermarked\" on all the training samples of the corresponding classes when the model is updated for a new task. This enables us to forget arbitrary classes later by only using the mnemonic codes without using the original data. Experiments on common benchmark datasets demonstrate the remarkable superiority of the proposed method over several existing methods.",

Most of the existing approaches are instance-specific and focus on the automatic computation of Symmetry Breaking Constraints (SBCs) for each given problem instance. However, the application of such approaches to large-scale instances or advanced problem encodings might be problematic. Moreover, the computed SBCs are propositional and, therefore, can neither be meaningfully interpreted nor transferred to other instances.\r\nTo overcome these limitations, we introduce a new model-oriented approach for Answer Set Programming that lifts the SBCs of small problem instances into a set of interpretable first-order constraints using the Inductive Logic Programming paradigm. \r\nExperiments demonstrate the ability of our framework to learn general constraints from instance-specific SBCs for a collection of combinatorial problems. The obtained results indicate that our approach significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art instance-specific method as well as the direct application of a solver.",

        "abstract": "Likelihood of generative models has been used traditionally as a score to detect atypical (Out-of-Distribution, OOD) inputs.  However, several recent studies have found this approach to be highly unreliable, even with invertible generative models, where computing the likelihood is feasible. In this paper, we present a different framework for generative model--based OOD detection that employs the model in constructing a new representation space, instead of using it directly in computing typicality scores, where it is emphasized that the score function should be interpretable as the similarity between the input and training data in the new space. In practice, with a focus on invertible models, we propose to extract low-dimensional features (statistics) based on the model encoder and complexity of input images, and then use a One-Class SVM to score the data. Contrary to recently proposed OOD detection methods for generative models, our method does not require computing likelihood values. Consequently, it is much faster when using invertible models with iteratively approximated likelihood (e.g. iResNet), while it still has a performance competitive with other related methods.",

The coarse feature representation and limited receptive field are considered as the main issues for these limitations. To address these issues, we propose a novel Soft Point-Wise Transformer for Descriptor and Detector, simultaneously mining long-range intrinsic and cross-scale dependencies of local features. Furthermore, our model leverages the distinct transformers based on the soft point-wise attention, substantially decreasing the memory and computation complexity, especially for high-resolution feature maps. In addition, multi-level decoder is constructed to guarantee the high detection accuracy and discriminative description. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on the image matching and visual localization benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Location prediction is of great importance in location-based applications for the construction of the smart city. To our knowledge, existing models for location prediction focus on the users' preference on POIs from the perspective of the human side. However, modeling users' interests from the historical trajectory is still limited by the data sparsity. Additionally, most of existing methods predict the next location according to the individual data independently. But the data sparsity makes it difficult to mine explicit mobility patterns or capture the casual behavior for each user. To address the issues above, we propose a novel Bi-direction Speculation and Dual-level Association method (BSDA), which considers both users' interests in POIs and POIs' appeal to users. Furthermore, we develop the cross-user and cross-POI association to alleviate the data sparsity by similar users and POIs to enrich the candidates. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that BSDA achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.",

Recent studies have tackled the problem using ALFRED, a well-designed dataset for the task, but achieved only very low accuracy. This paper proposes a new method, which outperforms the previous methods by a large margin. It is based on a combination of several new ideas. One is a two-stage interpretation of the provided instructions. The method first selects and interprets an instruction without using visual information, yielding a tentative action sequence prediction. It then integrates the prediction with the visual information etc., yielding the final prediction of an action and an object. As the object's class to interact is identified in the first stage, it can accurately select the correct object from the input image. Moreover, our method considers multiple egocentric views of the environment and extracts essential information by applying hierarchical attention conditioned on the current instruction. This contributes to the accurate prediction of actions for navigation. A preliminary version of the method won the ALFRED Challenge 2020. The current version achieves the unseen environment's success rate of 4.45% with a single view, which is further improved to 8.37% with multiple views.",

        "abstract": "As a prevailing task in video surveillance and forensics field, person re-identification (re-ID) aims to match person images captured from non-overlapped cameras. In unconstrained scenarios, person images often suffer from the resolution mismatch problem, i.e., Cross-Resolution Person Re-ID. To overcome this problem, most existing methods restore low resolution (LR) images to high resolution (HR) by super-resolution (SR). However, they only focus on the HR feature extraction and ignore the valid information from original LR images. In this work, we explore the influence of resolutions on feature extraction and develop a novel method for cross-resolution person re-ID called Multi-Resolution Representations Joint Learning (MRJL). Our method consists of a Resolution Reconstruction Network (RRN) and a Dual Feature Fusion Network (DFFN). The RRN uses an input image to construct a HR version and a LR version with an encoder and two decoders, while the DFFN adopts a dual-branch structure to generate person representations from multi-resolution images. Comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the superiority of the proposed MRJL over the relevent state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "A common theme of decision making in multi-agent systems is to assign utilities to alternatives, which individuals seek to maximize. This rationale is questionable in coalition formation where agents are affected by other members of their coalition. Based on the assumption that agents are benevolent towards other agents they like to form coalitions with, we propose loyalty in hedonic games, a binary relation dependent on agents' utilities. Given a hedonic game, we define a loyal variant where agents' utilities are defined by taking the minimum of their utility and the utilities of agents towards which they are loyal. This process can be iterated to obtain various degrees of loyalty, terminating in a locally egalitarian variant of the original game.\r\nWe investigate axioms of group stability and efficiency for different degrees of loyalty. Specifically, we consider the problem of finding coalition structures in the core and of computing best coalitions, obtaining both positive and intractability results. In particular, the limit game possesses Pareto optimal coalition structures in the core.",

        "abstract": "The interaction of multiple drugs could lead to serious events, which causes injuries and huge medical costs. Accurate prediction of drug-drug interaction (DDI) events can help clinicians make effective decisions and establish appropriate therapy programs. Recently, many AI-based techniques have been proposed for predicting DDI associated events. However, most existing methods pay less attention to the potential correlations between DDI events and other multimodal data such as targets and enzymes. To address this problem, we propose a Multimodal Deep Neural Network (MDNN) for DDI events prediction. In MDNN, we design a two-pathway framework including drug knowledge graph (DKG) based pathway and heterogeneous feature (HF) based pathway to obtain drug multimodal representations. Finally, a multimodal fusion neural layer is designed to explore the complementary among the drug multimodal representations. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world dataset. The results show that MDNN can accurately predict DDI events and outperform the state-of-the-art models.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of online generalization in tree search. We propose Multiple Estimator Monte Carlo Tree Search (ME-MCTS), with a two-fold contribution: first, we introduce a formalization of online generalization that can represent existing techniques such as \"history heuristics\", \"RAVE\", or \"OMA\" -- contextual action value estimators or abstractors that generalize across specific contexts. Second, we incorporate recent advances in estimator averaging that enable guiding search by combining the online action value estimates of any number of such abstractors or similar types of action value estimators.\r\nUnlike previous work, which usually proposed a single abstractor for either the selection or the rollout phase of MCTS simulations, our approach focuses on the combination of multiple estimators and applies them to all move choices in MCTS simulations. As the MCTS tree itself is just another value estimator -- unbiased, but without abstraction -- this blurs the traditional distinction between action choices inside and outside of the MCTS tree.\r\nExperiments with three abstractors in four board games show significant improvements of ME-MCTS over MCTS using only a single abstractor, both for MCTS with random rollouts as well as for MCTS with static evaluation functions.\r\nWhile we used deterministic, fully observable games, ME-MCTS naturally extends to more challenging settings.",

        "abstract": "Meta-learning has recently emerged as a promising technique to address the challenge of few-shot learning. However, standard meta-learning methods mainly focus on visual tasks, which makes it hard for them to deal with diverse text data directly. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for few-shot text classification, which is named as MEta-learning with Data Augmentation (MEDA). MEDA is composed of two modules, a ball generator and a meta-learner, which are learned jointly. The ball generator is to increase the number of shots per class by generating more samples, so that meta-learner can be trained with both original and augmented samples. It is worth noting that ball generator is agnostic to the choice of the meta-learning methods. Experiment results show that on both datasets, MEDA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and significantly improves the performance of meta-learning on few-shot text classification.",

In this paper, we propose a novel meta-optimized model MFNP, which can rapidly adapt to users with few check-in records. Towards the cold-start problem, it seamlessly integrates carefully designed user-specific and region-specific tasks in meta-learning, such that region-aware user preferences can be captured via a rational fusion of region-independent personal preferences and region-dependent crowd preferences. In modelling region-dependent crowd preferences, a cluster-based adaptive network is adopted to capture shared preferences from similar users for knowledge transfer. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on next POI recommendation for cold-start users.",

Our analysis on the Hawk-Dove and Nonmonotonic Cooperation matrix games evaluate MFVFD's convergent solution.

In this paper, we propose  MG-DVD,  a novel detection framework based on dynamic heterogeneous graph learning, to detect malware variants in real time.  Particularly, MG-DVD first models the fine-grained execution event streams of malware variants into dynamic heterogeneous graphs and investigates real-world meta-graphs between malware objects,  which can effectively characterize more discriminative malicious evolutionary patterns between malware and their variants. Then,  MG-DVD presents two dynamic walk-based heterogeneous graph learning methods to learn more comprehensive representations of malware variants,  which significantly reduces the cost of the entire graph retraining. As a result, MG-DVD  is equipped with the ability to detect malware variants in real time, and it presents better interpretability by introducing meaningful meta-graphs. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale samples prove that our proposed  MG-DVD  outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting malware variants in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Spoken question answering (SQA) has recently drawn considerable attention in the speech community. It requires systems to find correct answers from the given spoken passages simultaneously. The common SQA systems consist of the automatic speech recognition (ASR) module and text-based question answering module. However, previous methods suffer from severe performance degradation due to ASR errors. To alleviate this problem, this work proposes a novel multi-modal residual knowledge distillation method (MRD-Net), which further distills knowledge at the acoustic level from the audio-assistant (Audio-A). Specifically, we utilize the teacher (T) trained on manual transcriptions to guide the training of the student (S) on ASR transcriptions. We also show that introducing an Audio-A helps this procedure by learning residual errors between T and S. Moreover, we propose a simple yet effective attention mechanism to adaptively leverage audio-text features as the new deep attention knowledge to boost the network performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MRD-Net achieves superior results compared with state-of-the-art methods on three spoken question answering benchmark datasets.",

        "abstract": "Consider a graph G, representing a social network. Assume that initially each node is colored either black or white, which corresponds to a positive or negative opinion regarding a consumer product or a technological innovation. In the majority model, in each round all nodes simultaneously update their color to the most frequent color among their connections.\r\n\r\nExperiments on the graph data from the real world social networks (SNs) suggest that if all nodes in an extremely small set of high-degree nodes, often referred to as the elites, agree on a color, that color becomes the dominant color at the end of the process. We propose two countermeasures that can be adopted by individual nodes relatively easily and guarantee that the elites will not have this disproportionate power to engineer the dominant output color. The first countermeasure essentially requires each node to make some new connections at random while the second one demands the nodes to be more reluctant towards changing their color (opinion). We verify their effectiveness and correctness both theoretically and experimentally.\r\n\r\nWe also investigate the majority model and a variant of it when the initial coloring is random on the real world SNs and several random graph models. In particular, our results on the Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi, and regular random graphs confirm or support several theoretical findings or conjectures by the prior work regarding the threshold behavior of the process.\r\n\r\nFinally, we provide theoretical and experimental evidence for the existence of a poly-logarithmic bound on the expected stabilization time of the majority model.",

In such scenarios there might be a manipulative agent that would like to manipulate his connections in the social network in order to increase his utility. We study a model of coalition formation in which a central organizer, who needs to form k coalitions, obtains information about the social network from the agents.\r\nThe central organizer has her own objective: she might want to maximize the utilitarian social welfare, maximize the egalitarian social welfare, or only guarantee that every agent will have at least one connection within her coalition. \r\nIn this paper we study the susceptibility for manipulation of these objectives, given the abilities and information that the manipulator has. Specifically, we show that if the manipulator has very limited information, namely he is only familiar with his immediate neighbours in the network, then a manipulation is almost always impossible. Moreover, if the manipulator is only able to add connections to the social network, then a manipulation is still impossible for some objectives, even if the manipulator has full information on the structure of the network. On the other hand,  if the manipulator is able to hide some of his connections, then all objectives are susceptible to manipulation, even if the manipulator has limited information, i.e., when he is familiar with his immediate neighbours and with their neighbours.",

        "abstract": "In Goal-oriented Reinforcement learning, relabeling the raw goals in past experience to provide agents with hindsight ability is a major solution to the reward sparsity problem. In this paper, to enhance the diversity of relabeled goals, we develop FGI (Foresight Goal Inference), a new relabeling strategy that relabels the goals by looking into the future with a learned dynamics model. Besides, to improve sample efficiency, we propose to use the dynamics model to generate simulated trajectories for policy training. By integrating these two improvements, we introduce the MapGo framework (Model-Assisted Policy optimization for Goal-oriented tasks). In our experiments, we first show the effectiveness of the FGI strategy compared with the hindsight one, and then show that the MapGo framework achieves higher sample efficiency when compared to model-free baselines on a set of complicated tasks.",

        "abstract": "Detecting anomalies is one fundamental aspect of a safety-critical software system, however, it remains a long-standing problem. Numerous branches of works have been proposed to alleviate the complication and have shown promising results. In particular, self-supervised learning based methods are spurring interest due to their capability of learning diverse representations without additional labels. Among self-supervised learning tactics, contrastive learning is one specific framework showing pronounced results in various fields including anomaly detection. However, the primary objective of contrastive learning is to learn task-agnostic features without any labels, which is not entirely suited to discern anomalies. In this paper, we propose a task-specific variant of contrastive learning named masked contrastive learning, which is more befitted for anomaly detection. Moreover, we propose a new inference method dubbed self-ensemble inference that further boosts performance by leveraging the ability learned through auxiliary self-supervision tasks. By combining our models, we can outperform previous state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on various benchmark datasets.",

        "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) and label propagation algorithm (LPA) are both message passing algorithms, which have achieved superior performance in semi-supervised classification. GNN performs feature propagation by a neural network to make predictions, while LPA uses label propagation across graph adjacency matrix to get results. However, there is still no effective way to directly combine these two kinds of algorithms. To address this issue, we propose a novel Unified Message Passaging Model (UniMP) that can incorporate feature and label propagation at both training and inference time. First, UniMP adopts a Graph Transformer network, taking feature embedding and label embedding as input information for propagation. Second, to train the network without overfitting in self-loop input label information, UniMP introduces a masked label prediction strategy, in which some percentage of input label information are masked at random, and then predicted. UniMP conceptually unifies feature propagation and label propagation and is empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art semi-supervised classification results in Open Graph Benchmark (OGB).",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Visual Information Extraction (VIE) task aims to extract key information from multifarious document images (e.g., invoices and purchase receipts). Most previous methods treat the VIE task simply as a sequence labeling problem or classification problem, which requires models to carefully identify each kind of semantics by introducing multimodal features, such as font, color, layout. But simply introducing multimodal features can't work well when faced with numeric semantic categories or some ambiguous texts. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a novel key-value matching model based on a graph neural network for VIE (MatchVIE). Through key-value matching based on relevancy evaluation, the proposed MatchVIE can bypass the recognitions to various semantics, and simply focuses on the strong relevancy between entities. Besides, we introduce a simple but effective operation, Num2Vec, to tackle the instability of encoded values, which helps model converge more smoothly. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MatchVIE can significantly outperform previous methods. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, MatchVIE may be the first attempt to tackle the VIE task by modeling the relevancy between keys and values and it is a good complement to the existing methods.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of assigning items to platforms in the presence of group fairness constraints. In the input, each item belongs to certain categories, called classes in this paper. Each platform specifies the group fairness constraints through an upper bound on the number of items it can serve from each class. Additionally, each platform also has an upper bound on the total number of items it can serve. The goal is to assign items to platforms so as to maximize the number of items assigned while satisfying the upper bounds of each class. This problem models several important real-world problems like ad-auctions, scheduling, resource allocations, school choice etc. We show that if the classes are arbitrary, then the problem is NP-hard and has a strong inapproximability. We consider the problem in both online and offline settings under natural restrictions on the classes. Under these restrictions, the problem continues to remain NP-hard but admits approximation algorithms with small approximation factors. We also implement some of the algorithms. Our experiments show that the algorithms work well in practice both in terms of efficiency and the number of items that get assigned to some platform.",

        "abstract": "Mean field game facilitates analyzing multi-armed bandit (MAB) for a large number of agents by approximating their interactions with an average effect. Existing mean field models for multi-agent MAB mostly assume a binary reward function, which leads to tractable analysis but is usually not applicable in practical scenarios. In this paper, we study the mean field bandit game with a continuous reward function. Specifically, we focus on deriving the existence and uniqueness of mean field equilibrium (MFE), thereby guaranteeing the asymptotic stability of the multi-agent system. To accommodate the continuous reward function, we encode the learned reward into an agent state, which is in turn mapped to its stochastic arm playing policy and updated using realized observations. We show that the state evolution is upper semi-continuous, based on which the existence of MFE is obtained. As the Markov analysis is mainly for the case of discrete state, we transform the stochastic continuous state evolution into a deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE). On this basis, we can characterize a contraction mapping for the ODE to ensure a unique MFE for the bandit game. Extensive evaluations validate our MFE characterization, and exhibit tight empirical regret of the MAB problem.",

Combining Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Normalizing Flows (NF), we obtain a tractable solution requiring only very weak assumptions. Our algorithm finds a Nash Equilibrium and the agents adapt their velocity to match the neighboring flock\u2019s average one. We use Fictitious Play and alternate: (1) computing an approximate best response with Deep RL, and (2) estimating the next population distribution with NF.

        "abstract": "Medical image segmentation is important for computer-aided diagnosis. Good segmentation demands the model to see the big picture and fine details simultaneously, i.e., to learn image features that incorporate large context while keep high spatial resolutions. To approach this goal, the most widely used methods -- U-Net and variants, extract and fuse multi-scale features. However, the fused features still have small \"effective receptive fields\" with a focus on local image cues, limiting their performance. In this work, we propose Segtran, an alternative segmentation framework based on transformers, which have unlimited \"effective receptive fields\" even at high feature resolutions. The core of Segtran is a novel Squeeze-and-Expansion transformer: a squeezed attention block regularizes the self attention of transformers, and an expansion block learns diversified representations. Additionally, we propose a new positional encoding scheme for transformers, imposing a continuity inductive bias for images. Experiments were performed on 2D and 3D medical image segmentation tasks: optic disc/cup segmentation in fundus images (REFUGE'20 challenge), polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images, and brain tumor segmentation in MRI scans (BraTS'19 challenge). Compared with representative existing methods, Segtran consistently achieved the highest segmentation accuracy, and exhibited good cross-domain generalization capabilities.",

We run a study in which people play the game with an AI agent while ``thinking out loud''; through thematic analysis we identify features of the mental models developed by participants. In a large-scale study we have participants play the game with the AI agent online and use a post-game survey to probe their mental model. We find that those who win more often have better estimates of the AI agent's abilities. We present three components---global knowledge, local knowledge, and knowledge distribution---for modeling AI systems and propose that understanding the underlying technology is insufficient for developing appropriate conceptual models---analysis of behavior is also necessary.",

        "abstract": "Many real-world domains are subject to a structured non-stationarity which affects the agent's goals and the environmental dynamics. Meta-reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown successful for training agents that quickly adapt to related tasks. However, most of the existing meta-RL algorithms for non-stationary domains either make strong assumptions on the task generation process or require sampling from it at training time. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm (TRIO) that optimizes for the future by explicitly tracking the task evolution through time. At training time, TRIO learns a variational module to quickly identify latent parameters from experience samples. This module is learned jointly with an optimal exploration policy that takes task uncertainty into account. At test time, TRIO tracks the evolution of the latent parameters online, hence reducing the uncertainty over future tasks and obtaining fast adaptation through the meta-learned policy. Unlike most existing methods, TRIO does not assume Markovian task-evolution processes, it does not require information about the non-stationarity at training time, and it captures complex changes undergoing in the environment. We evaluate our algorithm on different simulated problems and show it outperforms competitive baselines.",

        "abstract": "Topic models are characterized by a latent class variable that represents the different topics. Traditionally, their observable variables are  modeled as discrete variables like, for instance, in the prototypical latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model. In LDA, words in text documents are encoded by discrete count vectors with respect to some dictionary. The classical approach for learning topic models optimizes a likelihood function that is non-concave due to the presence of the latent variable. Hence, this approach mostly boils down to using search heuristics like the EM algorithm for parameter estimation. Recently, it was shown that topic models can be learned with strong algorithmic and statistical guarantees through Pearson's method of moments. Here, we extend this line of work to topic models that feature discrete as well as continuous observable variables (features). Moving beyond discrete variables as in LDA allows for more sophisticated features and a natural extension of topic models to other modalities than text, like, for instance, images. We provide algorithmic and statistical guarantees for the method of moments applied to the extended topic model that we corroborate experimentally on synthetic data. We also demonstrate the applicability of our model on real-world document data with embedded images that we preprocess into continuous state-of-the-art feature vectors.",

However, the limited micro-expression datasets have posed a great challenge to train a high performance micro-expression classifier. Since micro-expression and macro-expression share some similarities in both spatial and temporal facial behavior patterns, we propose a macro-to-micro transformation framework for micro-expression recognition. Specifically, we first pretrain two-stream baseline model from micro-expression data and macro-expression data respectively, named MiNet and MaNet. Then, we introduce two auxiliary tasks to align the spatial and temporal features learned from micro-expression data and macro-expression data. In spatial domain, we introduce a domain discriminator to align the features of MiNet and MaNet. In temporal domain, we introduce relation classifier to predict the correct relation for temporal features from MaNet and MiNet. Finally, we propose contrastive loss to encourage the MiNet to give closely aligned features to all entries from the same class in each instance. Experiments on three benchmark databases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "RGB-infrared (IR) person re-identification is a challenging task due to the large modality gap between RGB and IR images. Many existing methods bridge the modality gap by style conversion, requiring high-similarity images exchanged by complex CNN structures, like GAN. In this paper, we propose a highly compact modality-aware style adaptation (MSA) framework, which aims to explore more potential relations between RGB and IR modalities by introducing new related modalities. Therefore, the attention is shifted from bridging to filling the modality gap with no requirement on high-quality generated images. To this end, we firstly propose a concise feature-free image generation structure to adapt the original modalities to two new styles that are compatible with both inputs by patch-based pixel redistribution. Secondly, we devise two image style quantification metrics to discriminate styles in image space using luminance and contrast. Thirdly, we design two image-level losses based on the quantified results to guide the style adaptation during an end-to-end four-modality collaborative learning process. Experimental results on two datasets SYSU-MM01 and RegDB show that MSA achieves significant improvements with little extra computation cost and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

We propose two model-based constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) algorithms for learning a safe policy, namely, (i) GM-CRL algorithm,  where the algorithm has access to a generative model, and (ii) UC-CRL  algorithm,  where the algorithm learns the model using an upper confidence style online exploration method.

To reduce the upper bound with the intention of low sample complexity during the whole learning process, we propose a novel decentralized model-based MARL method, named Adaptive Opponent-wise Rollout Policy Optimization (AORPO). In AORPO, each agent builds its multi-agent environment model, consisting of a dynamics model and multiple opponent models, and trains its policy with the adaptive opponent-wise rollout. We further prove the theoretic convergence of AORPO under reasonable assumptions. Empirical experiments on competitive and cooperative tasks demonstrate that AORPO can achieve improved sample efficiency with comparable asymptotic performance over the compared MARL methods.",

These regulatory systems are modeled by institutions and organizations, and the regulatory mechanisms by norms applied to agents in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). However, little is said about sharing resources, space and time. In particular,  temporal and spatial expressivity is often limited in MAS for institutions and norms. This research  proposes an institutional MAS model capable of representing multiple institutions and norms in the socio-ecosystem, in order to account for the multiplicity of interactions through agents, resources, space and time. We propose an extension of Descriptive Logic for the description of institutions and norms, and use Allen's algebra and the RCC8 to represent time and space.

For example, how do we expect rational (but computationally bounded) players to play games with a prohibitively large number of states, such as chess? This paper presents a novel model for the precomputation (preparing moves in advance) aspect of computationally constrained games. A fundamental trade-off is shown between randomness of play, and susceptibility to precomputation, suggesting that randomization is necessary in games with computational constraints. We present efficient algorithms for computing how susceptible a strategy is to precomputation, and computing an $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium of our model. Numerical experiments measuring the trade-off between randomness and precomputation are provided for Stockfish (a well-known chess playing algorithm).",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in location-acquisition techniques have generated massive spatial trajectory data. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are modern tools for modeling such trajectory data. After revisiting RNN-based methods for trajectory modeling, we expose two common critical drawbacks in the existing uses. First, RNNs are discrete-time models that only update the hidden states upon the arrival of new observations, which makes them an awkward fit for learning real-world trajectories with continuous-time dynamics. Second, real-world trajectories are never perfectly accurate due to unexpected sensor noise. Most RNN-based approaches are deterministic and thereby vulnerable to such noise. To tackle these challenges, we devise a novel method entitled TrajODE for more natural modeling of trajectories. It combines the continuous-time characteristic of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) with the robustness of stochastic latent spaces. Extensive experiments on the task of trajectory classification demonstrate the superiority of our framework against the RNN counterparts.",

        "abstract": "While the success of pre-trained language models has largely eliminated the need for high-quality static word vectors in many NLP applications, static word vectors continue to play an important role in tasks where word meaning needs to be modelled in the absence of linguistic context. In this paper, we explore how the contextualised embeddings predicted by BERT can be used to produce high-quality word vectors for such domains, in particular related to knowledge base completion, where our focus is on capturing the semantic properties of nouns. We find that a simple strategy of averaging the contextualised embeddings of masked word mentions leads to vectors that outperform the static word vectors learned by BERT, as well as those from standard word embedding models, in property induction tasks. We notice in particular that masking target words is critical to achieve this strong performance, as the resulting vectors focus less on idiosyncratic properties and more on general semantic properties. Inspired by this view, we propose a filtering strategy which is aimed at removing the most idiosyncratic mention vectors, allowing us to obtain further performance gains in property induction.",

It can be addressed by surrogate objectives for optimization. We propose Monte Carlo filtering objectives (MCFOs), a family of variational objectives for jointly learning parametric generative models and amortized adaptive importance proposals of time series. MCFOs extend the choices of likelihood estimators beyond Sequential Monte Carlo in state-of-the-art objectives, possess important properties revealing the factors for the tightness of objectives, and allow for less biased and variant gradient estimates. We demonstrate that the proposed MCFOs and gradient estimations lead to efficient and stable model learning, and learned generative models well explain data and importance proposals are more sample efficient on various kinds of time series data.",

These frameworks can be used to model a variety of situations. For instance, those in which\r\nagents have bounded logical resources and therefore fail to spot some of the actual attacks, or those where some arguments are not explicitly and fully\r\nstated (enthymematic argumentation). Moreover, we include second-order knowledge and common knowledge of the attack relation in our structures (where the latter accounts for the state of the debate), so as to reason about different kinds of persuasion and about strategic features. This version of multi-agent AFs, as well as their updates with public announcements of attacks (more concretely, the effects of these updates on the acceptability of an argument) can be described using S5-PAL, a well-known dynamic-epistemic logic. We also discuss how to extend our proposal to capture arbitrary higher-order attitudes and uncertainty.",

That is, while their goals are known, the precise programs used to achieve these goals are not known. In our approach, agents use an abstraction of their own program called a partially-ordered goal-plan tree (pGPT) to schedule their intentions and predict the actions of other agents. We show how a pGPT can be derived from the program of a BDI agent, and present an approach based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for scheduling an agent's intentions using pGPTs. We evaluate our pGPT-based approach in cooperative, selfish and adversarial multi-agent settings, and show that it out-performs MCTS-based scheduling where agents assume that other agents have the same program as themselves.",

        "abstract": "With increasing prosumers employed with distributed energy resources (DER), advanced energy management has become increasingly important. To this end, integrating demand-side DER into electricity market is a trend for future smart grids. The double-side auction (DA) market is viewed as a promising peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading mechanism that enables interactions among prosumers in a distributed manner. To achieve the maximum profit in a dynamic electricity market, prosumers act as price makers to simultaneously optimize their operations and trading strategies. However, the traditional DA market is difficult to be explicitly modelled due to its complex clearing algorithm and the stochastic bidding behaviors of the participants. For this reason, in this paper we model this task as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem and propose an algorithm called DA-MADDPG that is modified based on MADDPG by abstracting the other agents\u2019 observations and actions through the DA market public information for each agent\u2019s critic. The experiments show that 1) prosumers obtain more economic benefits in P2P energy trading w.r.t. the conventional electricity market independently trading with the utility company; and 2) DA-MADDPG performs better than the traditional Zero Intelligence (ZI) strategy and the other MARL algorithms, e.g., IQL, IDDPG, IPPO and MADDPG.",

        "abstract": "One fundamental problem in causality learning is to estimate the causal effects of one or multiple treatments (e.g., medicines in the prescription) on an important outcome (e.g., cure of a disease). One major challenge of causal effect estimation is the existence of unobserved confounders -- the unobserved variables that affect both the treatments and the outcome. Recent studies have shown that by modeling how instances are assigned with different treatments together, the patterns of unobserved confounders can be captured through their learned latent representations. However, the interpretability of the representations in these works is limited. In this paper, we focus on the multi-cause effect estimation problem from a new perspective by learning disentangled representations of confounders. The disentangled representations not only facilitate the treatment effect estimation but also strengthen the understanding of causality learning process. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets show the superiority of our proposed framework from different aspects.",

        "abstract": "Graph pooling is a critical operation to downsample a graph in graph neural networks. Existing coarsening pooling methods (e.g. DiffPool) mostly focus on capturing the global topology structure by assigning the nodes into several coarse clusters, while dropping pooling methods (e.g. SAGPool) try to preserve the local topology structure by selecting the top-k representative nodes. However, there lacks an effective method to integrate the two types of methods so that both the local and the global topology structure of a graph can be well captured. To address this issue, we propose a Multi-channel Graph Pooling method named MuchPool, which captures the local structure, the global structure, and node feature simultaneously in graph pooling. Specifically, we use two channels to conduct dropping pooling based on the local topology and node features respectively, and one channel to conduct coarsening pooling. Then a cross-channel convolution operation is designed to refine the graph representations of different channels. Finally, the pooling results are aggregated as the final pooled graph. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets present the superior performance of MuchPool. The code of this work is publicly available at Github.",

One notable task requiring multi-hop reasoning is fact checking, where a set of connected evidence pieces leads to the final verdict of a claim. However, existing datasets either do not provide annotations for gold evidence pages, or the only dataset which does (FEVER) mostly consists of claims which can be fact-checked with simple reasoning and is constructed artificially. Here, we study more complex claim verification of naturally occurring claims with multiple hops over interconnected evidence chunks. We: 1) construct a small annotated dataset, PolitiHop, of evidence sentences for claim verification; 2) compare it to existing multi-hop datasets; and 3) study how to transfer knowledge from more extensive in- and out-of-domain resources to PolitiHop. We find that the task is complex and achieve the best performance with an architecture that specifically models reasoning over evidence pieces in combination with in-domain transfer learning.",

        "abstract": "Skeleton-based person re-identification (Re-ID) is an emerging open topic providing great value for safety-critical applications. Existing methods typically extract hand-crafted features or model skeleton dynamics from the trajectory of body joints, while they rarely explore valuable relation information contained in body structure or motion. To fully explore body relations, we construct graphs to model human skeletons from different levels, and for the first time propose a Multi-level Graph encoding approach with Structural-Collaborative Relation learning (MG-SCR) to encode discriminative graph features for person Re-ID. Specifically, considering that structurally-connected body components are highly correlated in a skeleton, we first propose a multi-head structural relation layer to learn different relations of neighbor body-component nodes in graphs, which helps aggregate key correlative features for effective node representations. Second, inspired by the fact that body-component collaboration in walking usually carries recognizable patterns, we propose a cross-level collaborative relation layer to infer collaboration between different level components, so as to capture more discriminative skeleton graph features. Finally, to enhance graph dynamics encoding, we propose a novel self-supervised sparse sequential prediction task for model pre-training, which facilitates encoding high-level graph semantics for person Re-ID. MG-SCR outperforms state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods, and it achieves superior performance to many multi-modal methods that utilize extra RGB or depth features.

        "abstract": "AI research is being challenged with ensuring that autonomous agents learn to behave ethically, namely in alignment with moral values. A common approach, founded on the exploitation of Reinforcement Learning techniques, is to design environments that incentivise agents to behave ethically. However, to the best of our knowledge, current approaches do not theoretically guarantee that an agent will learn to behave ethically.  Here, we make headway along this direction by proposing a novel way of designing environments wherein it is formally guaranteed that an agent learns to behave ethically while pursuing its individual objectives.  Our theoretical results develop within the formal framework of Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning to ease the handling of an agent's individual and ethical objectives. As a further contribution, we leverage on our theoretical results to introduce an algorithm that automates the design of ethical environments.",

        "abstract": "Graph representation learning plays a vital role in processing graph-structured data. However, prior arts on graph representation learning heavily rely on labeling information. To overcome this problem, inspired by the recent success of graph contrastive learning and Siamese networks in visual representation learning, we propose a novel self-supervised approach in this paper to learn node representations by enhancing Siamese self-distillation with multi-scale contrastive learning. Specifically, we first generate two augmented views from the input graph based on local and global perspectives. Then, we employ two objectives called cross-view and cross-network contrastiveness to maximize the agreement between node representations across different views and networks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform empirical experiments on five real-world datasets. Our method not only achieves new state-of-the-art results but also surpasses some semi-supervised counterparts by large margins. Code is made available at https://github.com/GRAND-Lab/MERIT",

        "abstract": "The feedback mechanism in the human visual system extracts high-level semantics from noisy scenes. It then guides low-level noise removal, which has not been fully explored in image denoising networks based on deep learning. The commonly used fully-supervised network optimizes parameters through paired training data. However, unpaired images without noise-free labels are ubiquitous in the real world. Therefore, we proposed a multi-scale selective feedback network (MSFN) with the dual loss. We allow shallow layers to access valuable contextual information from the following deep layers selectively between two adjacent time steps. Iterative refinement mechanism can remove complex noise from coarse to fine. The dual regression is designed to reconstruct noisy images to establish closed-loop supervision that is training-friendly for unpaired data. We use the dual loss to optimize the primary clean-to-noisy task and the dual noisy-to-clean task simultaneously. Extensive experiments prove that our method achieves state-of-the-art results and shows better adaptability on real-world images than the existing methods.",

        "abstract": "Visual backdoor attack is a recently-emerging task which aims to implant trojans in a deep neural model. A trojaned model responds to a trojan-invoking trigger in a fully predictable manner while functioning normally otherwise. As a key motivating fact to this work, most triggers adopted in existing methods, such as a learned patterned block that overlays a benigh image, can be easily noticed by human. In this work, we take image recognition and detection as the demonstration tasks, building trojaned networks that are significantly less human-perceptible and can simultaneously attack multiple targets in an image. The main technical contributions are two-folds: first, under a relaxed attack mode, we formulate trigger embedding as an image steganography-and-steganalysis problem that conceals a secret image in another image in a decipherable and almost invisible way. In specific, a variable number of different triggers can be encoded into a same secret image and fed to an encoder module that does steganography. Secondly, we propose a generic split-and-merge scheme for training a trojaned model. Neurons are split into two sets, trained either for normal image recognition / detection or trojaning the model. To merge them, we novelly propose to hide trojan neurons within the nullspace of the normal ones, such that the two sets do not interfere with each other and the resultant model exhibits similar parameter statistics to a clean model. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the datasets PASCAL VOC and Microsoft COCO (for detection) and a subset of ImageNet (for recognition). All results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed visual trojan method.",

In the absence of central control, we are interested in forming a fleet of autonomous vehicles capable of responding to city-scale travel demands. \r\nTypically, this problem is solved centrally; this implies that the vehicles have continuous access to a dispatching portal. However, such access to such a global switching infrastructure (for data collection and order delivery) is costly and represents a critical bottleneck. The idea is to use low-cost vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technologies to coordinate vehicles without a global communication infrastructure.\r\nWe propose to model the different aspects of decision and optimization problems related to this more general problem. After modeling these problems, the question arises as to the choice of centralized and decentralized solution methods. Methodologically, we explore the directions and compare the performance of distributed constraint optimization techniques (DCOP), self-organized multi-agent techniques, market-based approaches, and centralized operations research solutions.",

        "abstract": "Self-attention mechanism in graph neural networks (GNNs) led to state-of-the-art performance on many graph representation learning tasks. Currently, at every layer, attention is computed between connected pairs of nodes and depends solely on the representation of the two nodes. However, such attention mechanism does not account for nodes that are not directly connected but provide important network context. Here we propose Multi-hop Attention Graph Neural Network (MAGNA), a principled way to incorporate multi-hop context information into every layer of attention computation. MAGNA diffuses the attention scores across the network, which increases the receptive field for every layer of the GNN. Unlike previous approaches, MAGNA uses a diffusion prior on attention values, to efficiently account for all paths between the pair of disconnected nodes. We demonstrate in theory and experiments that MAGNA captures large-scale structural information in every layer, and has a low-pass effect that eliminates noisy high-frequency information from graph data. Experimental results on node classification as well as the knowledge graph completion benchmarks show that MAGNA achieves state-of-the-art results: MAGNA achieves up to 5.7% relative error reduction over the previous state-of-the-art on Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed. MAGNA also obtains the best performance on a large-scale Open Graph Benchmark dataset. On knowledge graph completion MAGNA advances state-of-the-art on WN18RR and FB15k-237 across four different performance metrics.",

MGPLL uses a conditional noise label generation network to model the non-random noise labels and perform label denoising, and uses a multi-class predictor to map the training instances to the denoised label vectors, while a conditional data feature generator is used to form an inverse mapping from the denoised label vectors to data samples. Both the noise label generator and the data feature generator are learned in an adversarial manner to match the observed candidate labels and data features respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthesized and real-world partial label datasets. The proposed approach\r\ndemonstrates the state-of-the-art performance for partial label learning.",

Based on EHRs, in this work, we focus on sepsis -- a broad syndrome that can develop from nearly all types of infections (e.g., influenza, pneumonia). The symptoms of sepsis, such as elevated heart rate, fever, and shortness of breath, are vague and common to other illnesses, making the modeling of its progression extremely challenging. Motivated by the recent success of a novel subsequence clustering approach: Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-based Clustering (TICC), we model the sepsis progression as a subsequence partitioning problem and propose a Multi-series Time-aware TICC (MT-TICC), which incorporates multi-series nature and irregular time intervals of EHRs. The effectiveness of MT-TICC is first validated via a case study using a real-world hand gesture dataset with ground-truth labels. Then we further apply it for sepsis progression modeling using EHRs. The results suggest that MT-TICC can significantly outperform competitive baseline models, including the TICC. More importantly, it unveils interpretable patterns, which sheds some light on better understanding the sepsis progression.",

        "abstract": "Real-world spatio-temporal data is often incomplete or inaccurate due to various data loading delays. For example, a location-disease-time tensor of case counts can have multiple delayed updates of recent temporal slices for some locations or diseases. Recovering such missing or noisy (under-reported) elements of the input tensor can be viewed as a generalized tensor completion problem. Existing tensor completion methods usually assume that i) missing elements are randomly distributed and ii) noise for each tensor element is i.i.d. zero-mean. Both assumptions can be violated for spatio-temporal tensor data. We often observe multiple versions of the input tensor with different under-reporting noise levels. The amount of noise can be time- or location-dependent as more updates are progressively introduced to the tensor. We model such dynamic data as a multi-version tensor with an extra tensor mode capturing the data updates. We propose a low-rank tensor model to predict the updates over time. We demonstrate that our method can accurately predict the ground-truth values of many real-world tensors. We obtain up to  27.2%  lower root mean-squared-error compared to the best baseline method. Finally, we extend our method to track the tensor data over time, leading to significant computational savings.",

        "abstract": "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), i.e., the task of assigning senses to words in context, has seen a surge of interest with the advent of neural models and a considerable increase in performance up to 80% F1 in English. However, when considering other languages, the availability of training data is limited, which hampers scaling WSD to many languages. To address this issue, we put forward MultiMirror, a sense projection approach for multilingual WSD based on a novel neural discriminative model for word alignment: given as input a pair of parallel sentences, our model -- trained with a low number of instances -- is capable of jointly aligning, at the same time, all source and target tokens with each other, surpassing its competitors across several language combinations. We demonstrate that projecting senses from English by leveraging the alignments produced by our model leads a simple mBERT-powered classifier to achieve a new state of the art on established WSD datasets in French, German, Italian, Spanish and Japanese. We release our software and all our datasets at https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/multimirror.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of forecasting the future locations of pedestrians in an ego-centric view of a moving vehicle. Current CNNs or RNNs are flawed in capturing the high dynamics of motion between pedestrians and the ego-vehicle, and suffer from the massive parameter usages due to the inefficiency of learning long-term temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose an efficient multimodal transformer network that aggregates the trajectory and ego-vehicle speed variations at a coarse granularity and interacts with the optical flow in a fine-grained level to fill the vacancy of highly dynamic motion. Specifically, a coarse-grained fusion stage fuses the information between trajectory and ego-vehicle speed modalities to capture the general temporal consistency. Meanwhile, a fine-grained fusion stage merges the optical flow in the center area and pedestrian area, which compensates the highly dynamic motion of ego-vehicle and target pedestrian. Besides, the whole network is only attention-based that can efficiently model long-term sequences for better capturing the temporal variations. Our multimodal transformer is validated on the PIE and JAAD datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance with the most light-weight model size.

We ask whether the Nash welfare's well-studied balance between fairness and efficiency also applies to the facility location setting, and what agent strategic behaviour may occur under this facility placement.",

        "abstract": "Link prediction based on knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) has recently drawn a considerable momentum. However, existing KGE models suffer from insufficient accuracy and hardly evaluate the confidence probability of each predicted triple. To fill this critical gap, we propose a novel confidence measurement method based on causal intervention, called Neighborhood Intervention Consistency (NIC). Unlike previous confidence measurement methods that focus on the optimal score in a prediction, NIC actively intervenes in the input entity vector to measure the robustness of the prediction result. The experimental results on ten popular KGE models show that our NIC method can effectively estimate the confidence score of each predicted triple. The top 10% triples with high NIC confidence can achieve 30% higher accuracy in the state-of-the-art KGE models.",

To address this problem, we first introduce a geometrically rich and diverse SPD neural architecture search space for an efficient SPD cell design. Further, we model our new NAS problem with a one-shot training process of a single supernet. Based on the supernet modeling, we exploit a differentiable NAS algorithm on our relaxed continuous search space for SPD neural architecture search. Statistical evaluation of our method on drone, action, and emotion recognition tasks mostly provides better results than the state-of-the-art SPD networks and traditional NAS algorithms. Empirical results show that our algorithm excels in discovering better performing SPD network design and provides models that are more than three times lighter than searched by the state-of-the-art NAS algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Distributed constraint optimization problems (DCOPs) are a powerful model for multi-agent coordination and optimization, where information and controls are distributed among multiple agents by nature. Sampling-based algorithms are important incomplete techniques for solving medium-scale DCOPs. However, they use tables to exactly store all the information (e.g., costs, confidence bounds) to facilitate sampling, which limits their scalability. This paper tackles the limitation by incorporating deep neural networks in solving DCOPs for the first time and presents a neural-based sampling scheme built upon regret-matching. In the algorithm, each agent trains a neural network to approximate the regret related to its local problem and performs sampling according to the estimated regret. Furthermore, to ensure exploration we propose a regret rounding scheme that rounds small regret values to positive numbers. We theoretically show the regret bound of our algorithm and extensive evaluations indicate that our algorithm can scale up to large-scale DCOPs and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Relation discovery for multi-dimensional temporal point processes (MTPP) has received increasing interest for its importance in prediction and interpretability of the underlying dynamics. Traditional statistical MTPP models like Hawkes Process have difficulty in capturing complex relation due to their limited parametric form of the intensity function. While recent neural-network-based models suffer poor interpretability. In this paper, we propose a neural relation inference model namely TPP-NRI. Given MTPP data, it adopts a variational inference framework to model the posterior relation of MTPP data for probabilistic estimation. Specifically, assuming the prior of the relation is known, the conditional probability of the MTPP conditional on a sampled relation is captured by a message passing graph neural network (GNN) based MTPP model. A variational distribution is introduced to approximate the true posterior. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that our model outperforms baseline methods on both inference capability and scalability for high-dimensional data.",

To derive node representations, they utilize a global model that recursively aggregates information from the neighboring nodes. However, different nodes reside at different parts of the graph in different local contexts, making their distributions vary across the graph. Ideally, how a node receives its neighborhood information should be a function of its local context, to diverge from the global GNN model shared by all nodes. To utilize node locality without overfitting, we propose a node-wise localization of GNNs by accounting for both global and local aspects of the graph. Globally, all nodes on the graph depend on an underlying global GNN to encode the general patterns across the graph; locally, each node is localized into a unique model as a function of the global model and its local context. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark graphs, and consistently obtain promising performance surpassing the state-of-the-art GNNs.",

        "abstract": "Deep image inpainting aims to restore damaged or missing regions in an image with realistic contents. While having a wide range of applications such as object removal and image recovery, deep inpainting techniques also have the risk of being manipulated for image forgery. A promising countermeasure against such forgeries is deep inpainting detection, which aims to locate the inpainted regions in an image. In this paper, we make the first attempt towards universal detection of deep inpainting, where the detection network can generalize well when detecting different deep inpainting methods. To this end, we first propose a novel data generation approach to generate a universal training dataset, which imitates the noise discrepancies exist in real versus inpainted image contents to train universal detectors. We then design a Noise-Image Cross-fusion Network (NIX-Net) to effectively exploit the discriminative information contained in both the images and their noise patterns. We empirically show, on multiple benchmark datasets, that our approach outperforms existing detection methods by a large margin and generalize well to unseen deep inpainting techniques. Our universal training dataset can also significantly boost the generalizability of existing detection methods.",

        "abstract": "In many image denoising tasks, the difficulty of collecting noisy/clean image pairs limits the application of supervised CNNs. We consider such a case in which paired data and noise statistics are not accessible, but unpaired noisy and clean images are easy to collect. To form the necessary supervision, our strategy is to extract the noise from the noisy image to synthesize new data. To ease the interference of the image background, we use a noise removal module to aid noise extraction. The noise removal module first roughly removes noise from the noisy image, which is equivalent to excluding much background information. A noise approximation module can therefore easily extract a new noise map from the removed noise to match the gradient of the noisy input. This noise map is added to a random clean image to synthesize a new data pair, which is then fed back to the noise removal module to correct the noise removal process. These two modules cooperate to extract noise finely. After convergence, the noise removal module can remove noise without damaging other background details, so we use it as our final denoising network. Experiments show that the denoising performance of the proposed method is competitive with other supervised CNNs.",

        "abstract": "Multi-instance learning is a type of weakly supervised learning. It deals with tasks where the data is a set of bags and each bag is a set of instances. Only the bag labels are observed whereas the labels for the instances are unknown. An important advantage of multi-instance learning is that by representing objects as a bag of instances, it is able to preserve the inherent dependencies among parts of the objects. Unfortunately, most existing algorithms assume all instances to be identically and independently distributed, which violates real-world scenarios since the instances within a bag are rarely independent. In this work, we propose the Multi-Instance Variational Autoencoder (MIVAE) algorithm which explicitly models the dependencies among the instances for predicting both bag labels and instance labels. Experimental results on several multi-instance benchmarks and end-to-end medical imaging datasets demonstrate that MIVAE performs better than state-of-the-art algorithms for both instance label and bag label prediction tasks.",

Upon each job arrival, the decision-maker must decide immediately whether or not to accept the job and gain the value on offer as a reward, with the constraint that they may only accept at most n jobs over some reference time period. The decision-maker only has access to M independent realisations of the job arrival process. We propose an algorithm, Non-Parametric Sequential Allocation (NPSA), for solving this problem. Moreover, we prove that the expected reward returned by the NPSA algorithm converges in probability to optimality as M grows large.

        "abstract": "Automatic pain recognition is paramount for medical diagnosis and treatment. The existing works fall into three categories: assessing facial appearance changes, exploiting physiological cues, or fusing them in a multi-modal manner. However, (1) appearance changes are easily affected by subjective factors which impedes objective pain recognition. Besides, the appearance-based approaches ignore long-range spatial-temporal dependencies that are important for modeling expressions over time; (2) the physiological cues are obtained by attaching sensors on human body, which is inconvenient and uncomfortable. In this paper, we present a novel multi-task learning framework which encodes both appearance changes and physiological cues in a non-contact manner for pain recognition. The framework is able to capture both local and long-range dependencies via the proposed attention mechanism for the learned appearance representations, which are further enriched by temporally attended physiological cues (remote photoplethysmography, rPPG) that are recovered from videos in the auxiliary task. This framework is dubbed rPPG-enriched Spatio-Temporal Attention Network (rSTAN) and allows us to establish the state-of-the-art performance of non-contact pain recognition on publicly available pain databases. It demonstrates that rPPG predictions can be used as an auxiliary task to facilitate non-contact automatic pain recognition.",

One is how to ensure the validity of the learned quantile function, the other is how to efficiently utilize the distribution information. This paper attempts to provide some new perspectives to encourage the future in-depth studies in these two fields. We first propose a non-decreasing quantile function network (NDQFN) to guarantee the monotonicity of the obtained quantile estimates and then design a general exploration framework called distributional prediction error (DPE) for DRL which utilizes the entire distribution of the quantile function. In this paper, we not only discuss the theoretical necessity of our method but also show the performance gain it achieves in practice by comparing with some competitors on Atari 2600 Games especially in some hard-explored games.",

        "abstract": "Zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR), which aims to retrieve photos with sketches under the zero-shot scenario, has shown extraordinary talents in real-world applications. Most existing methods leverage language models to generate class-prototypes and use them to arrange the locations of all categories in the common space for photos and sketches. Although great progress has been made, few of them consider whether such pre-defined prototypes are necessary for ZS-SBIR, where locations of unseen class samples in the embedding space are actually determined by visual appearance and a visual embedding actually performs better. To this end, we propose a novel Norm-guided Adaptive Visual Embedding (NAVE) model, for adaptively building the common space based on visual similarity instead of language-based pre-defined prototypes. To further enhance the representation quality of unseen classes for both photo and sketch modality, modality norm discrepancy and noisy label regularizer are jointly employed to measure and repair the modality bias of the learned common embedding. Experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our NAVE over state-of-the-art competitors.",

        "abstract": "Novelty detection is the process of determining whether a query example differs from the learned training distribution. Previous generative adversarial networks based methods and self-supervised approaches suffer from instability training, mode dropping, and low discriminative ability. We overcome such problems by introducing a novel decoder-encoder framework. Firstly,  a generative network (decoder) learns the representation by mapping the initialized latent vector to an image. In particular, this vector is initialized by considering the entire distribution of training data to avoid the problem of mode-dropping. Secondly, a contrastive network (encoder) aims to ``learn to compare'' through mutual information estimation, which directly helps the generative network to obtain a more discriminative representation by using a negative data augmentation strategy. Extensive experiments show that our model has significant superiority over cutting-edge novelty detectors and achieves new state-of-the-art results on various novelty detection benchmarks, e.g. CIFAR10 and DCASE. Moreover, our model is more stable for training in a non-adversarial manner, compared to other adversarial based novelty detection methods.",

Their remarkable performance, however, heavily depends on the availability of a large number of high quality labeled data, which are time-consuming and costly to acquire for scenes with densely packed objects.  We present a novel semi-supervised approach to addressing this problem, which is designed based on a common teacher-student model, integrated with a novel intersection-over-union (IoU) aware consistency loss and a new proposal consistency loss. The IoU-aware consistency loss evaluates the IoU over the prediction pairs of the teacher model and the student model, which enforces the prediction of the student model to approach closely to that of the teacher model. The IoU-aware consistency loss also reweights the importance of different prediction pairs to suppress the low-confident pairs. The proposal consistency loss ensures proposal consistency between the two models, making it possible to involve the region proposal network in the training process with unlabeled data. We also construct a new dataset, namely RebarDSC, containing 2,125 rebar images annotated with 350,348 bounding boxes in total (164.9 annotations per image average), to evaluate the proposed method. Extensive experiments are conducted over both the RebarDSC dataset and the famous large public dataset SKU-110K. Experimental results corroborate that the proposed method is able to improve the object detection performance in densely packed scenes, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Conventional traffic simulators usually employ a calibrated physical car-following model to describe vehicles' behaviors and their interactions with traffic environment. However, there is no universal physical model that can accurately predict the pattern of vehicle's behaviors in different situations. A fixed physical model tends to be less effective in a complicated environment given the non-stationary nature of traffic dynamics. In this paper, we formulate traffic simulation as an inverse reinforcement learning problem, and propose a parameter sharing adversarial inverse reinforcement learning model for dynamics-robust simulation learning. Our proposed model is able to imitate a vehicle's trajectories in the real world while simultaneously recovering the reward function that reveals the vehicle's true objective which is invariant to different dynamics. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods and its robustness to variant dynamics of traffic.",

        "abstract": "An important issue in ML consists in developing approaches exploiting background knowledge T for improving the accuracy and the robustness of learned classifiers C. Delegating the classification task to a Boolean circuit \u03a3 exhibiting the same input-output behaviour as C, the problem of exploiting T within C can be viewed as a belief change scenario. However, usual change operations are not suited to the task of modifying the classifier encoding \u03a3 in a minimal way, to make it complying with T. To fill the gap, we present a new belief change operation, called rectification. We characterize the family of rectification operators from an axiomatic perspective and exhibit operators from this family. We identify the standard belief change postulates that every rectification operator satisfies and those it does not. We also focus on some computational aspects of rectification and compliance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract argumentation as defined by Dung in his seminal 1995 paper is by now a major research area in knowledge representation and reasoning. Dynamics of abstract argumentation frameworks (AFs) as well as syntactical consequences of semantical facts of them are the central issues of this paper. The first main part is engaged with the systematical study of the influence of attackers and supporters regarding the acceptability status of whole sets and/or single arguments. In particular, we investigate the impact of addition or removal of arguments, a line of research that has been around for more than a decade. Apart from entirely new results, we revisit, generalize and sum up similar results from the literature. To gain a comprehensive formal and intuitive understanding of the behavior of AFs we put special effort in comparing different kind of semantics. We concentrate on classical admissibility-based semantics and also give pointers to semantics based on naivity and weak admissibility, a recently introduced mediating approach. In the second main part we show how to infer syntactical information from semantical one. For instance, it is well-known that if a finite AF possesses no stable extension, then it has to contain an odd-cycle. In this paper, we even present a characterization of this issue. Moreover, we show that the change of the number of extensions if adding or removing an argument allows to conclude the existence of certain even or odd cycles in the considered AF without having further information.",

        "abstract": "Random Forest (RFs) are among the most widely used Machine Learning  (ML) classifiers. Even though RFs are not interpretable, there are no dedicated  non-heuristic approaches for computing explanations of RFs. Moreover, there is recent work on polynomial algorithms for explaining ML models, including naive Bayes classifiers. Hence, one question is whether finding explanations of RFs  can be solved in polynomial time. This paper answers this question negatively, by proving that computing one PI-explanation of an RF is D^P-hard. Furthermore, the paper proposes a propositional encoding for  computing explanations of RFs, thus enabling finding PI-explanations   with a SAT solver. This contrasts with earlier work on explaining boosted trees  (BTs) and neural networks (NNs), which requires encodings based on  SMT/MILP. Experimental results, obtained on a wide range of publicly available  datasets, demonstrate that the proposed SAT-based approach scales to  RFs of sizes common in practical applications. Perhaps more  importantly, the experimental results demonstrate that, for the vast  majority of examples considered, the SAT-based approach proposed in  this paper significantly outperforms existing heuristic approaches.",

Our explanations comprise a subset of the words of the input text that satisfies two key features: optimality w.r.t. a user-defined cost function, such as the length of explanation, and robustness, in that they ensure prediction invariance for any bounded perturbation in the embedding space of the left-out words. We present two solution algorithms, respectively based on implicit hitting sets and maximum universal subsets, introducing a number of algorithmic improvements to speed up convergence of hard instances. We show how our method can be configured with different perturbation sets in the embedded space and used to detect bias in predictions by enforcing include/exclude constraints on biased terms, as well as to enhance existing heuristic-based NLP explanation frameworks such as Anchors. We evaluate our framework on three widely used sentiment analysis tasks and texts of up to 100 words from SST, Twitter and IMDB datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the derived explanations.",

        "abstract": "Learning from unordered sets is a fundamental learning setup, recently attracting increasing attention. Research in this area has focused on the case where elements of the set are represented by feature vectors, and far less emphasis has been given to the common case where set elements themselves adhere to their own symmetries. That case is relevant to numerous applications, from deblurring image bursts to multi-view 3D shape recognition and reconstruction. In this paper, we present a principled approach to learning sets of general symmetric elements. We first characterize the space of linear layers that are equivariant both to element reordering and to the inherent symmetries of elements, like translation in the case of images. We further show that networks that are composed of these layers, called Deep Sets for Symmetric Elements layers (DSS), are universal approximators of both invariant and equivariant functions, and that these networks are strictly more expressive than Siamese networks. DSS layers are also straightforward to implement. Finally, we show that they improve over existing set-learning architectures in a series of experiments with images, graphs, and point clouds.",

Item recommendation algorithms are evaluated by metrics that compare the positions of truly relevant items among the recommended items. To speed up the computation of metrics, recent work often uses sampled metrics where only a smaller set of random items and the relevant items are ranked. This paper investigates such sampled metrics and shows that they are inconsistent with their exact counterpart, in the sense that they do not persist relative statements, e.g., recommender A is better than B, not even in expectation. We show that it is possible to improve the quality of the sampled metrics by applying a correction. We conclude with an empirical evaluation of the naive sampled metrics and their corrected variants. Our work suggests that sampling should be avoided for metric calculation, however if an experimental study needs to sample, the proposed corrections can improve the estimates.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the teacher-student knowledge distillation framework has demonstrated its potential in training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, due to the difficulty of training over-parameterized GNN models, one may not easily obtain a satisfactory teacher model for distillation. Furthermore, the inefficient training process of teacher-student knowledge distillation also impedes its applications in GNN models. In this paper, we propose the first teacher-free knowledge distillation method for GNNs, termed GNN Self-Distillation (GNN-SD), that serves as a drop-in replacement of the standard training process. The method is built upon the proposed neighborhood discrepancy rate (NDR), which quantifies the non-smoothness of the embedded graph in an efficient way. Based on this metric, we propose the adaptive discrepancy retaining (ADR) regularizer to empower the transferability of knowledge that maintains high neighborhood discrepancy across GNN layers. We also summarize a generic GNN-SD framework that could be exploited to induce other distillation strategies. Experiments further prove the effectiveness and generalization of our approach, as it brings: 1) state-of-the-art GNN distillation performance with less training cost, 2) consistent and considerable performance enhancement for various popular backbones.",

Using dynamical systems theory, we theoretically analyze the robustness of these attributions. We also experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in providing smoother, visually sharper and quantitatively robust attributions by computing attributions for ImageNet images using ResNet-50, WideResNet-101 models and ResNeXt-101 models.",

        "abstract": "We study the secretary problem in multi-agent environments.  In the standard secretary problem, a sequence of arbitrary awards arrive online, in a random order, and a single decision maker makes an immediate and irrevocable decision whether to accept each award upon its arrival.  The requirement to make immediate decisions arises in many cases due to an implicit assumption regarding competition. Namely, if the decision maker does not take the offered award immediately, it will be taken by someone else. We introduce a novel multi-agent secretary model, in which the competition is explicit.\r\nIn our model, multiple agents compete over the arriving awards, but the decisions need not be immediate; instead, agents may select previous awards as long as they are available (i.e., not taken by another agent). If an award is selected by multiple agents, ties are broken either randomly or according to a global ranking.\r\nThis induces a multi-agent game in which the time of selection is not enforced by the rules of the games, rather it is an important component of the agent's strategy.\r\nWe study the structure and performance of equilibria in this game. \r\nFor random tie breaking, we characterize the equilibria of the  game, and show that the expected social welfare in equilibrium is nearly optimal, despite competition among the agents.\r\nFor ranked tie breaking, we give a full characterization of equilibria in the 3-agent game, and show that as the number of agents grows, the winning probability of every agent under non-immediate selections approaches her winning probability under immediate selections.",

In this paper, we develop a novel efficient stochastic compositional gradient descent ascent method for optimizing the compositional minimax problem. Moreover, we establish the theoretical convergence rate of our proposed method.

Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Differentially private machine learning trains models while protecting privacy of the sensitive training data. The key to obtain differentially private models is to introduce noise/randomness to the training process. In particular, existing differentially private machine learning methods add noise to the training data, the gradients, the loss function, and/or the model itself. Bagging, a popular ensemble learning framework, randomly creates some subsamples of the training data, trains a base model for each subsample using a base learner, and takes majority vote among the base models when making predictions.  Bagging has intrinsic randomness in the training process as it randomly creates subsamples. Our major theoretical results show that such intrinsic randomness already makes Bagging differentially private without the needs of additional noise. Moreover, we prove that if no assumptions about the base learner are made, our derived privacy guarantees are tight. We empirically evaluate Bagging on MNIST and CIFAR10. Our experimental results demonstrate that Bagging achieves significantly higher accuracies than state-of-the-art differentially private machine learning methods with the same privacy budgets.",

        "abstract": "Since knowledge engineering is an inherently challenging and somewhat unbounded task, machine learning has been widely proposed as an alternative. In real world scenarios, we often need to explicitly model multiple agents, where intelligent agents act towards achieving goals either by coordinating with the other agents or by overseeing the opponents moves, if in a competitive context. We consider the knowledge acquisition problem where agents have knowledge about the world and other agents and then acquire new knowledge (both about the world as well as other agents) in service of answering queries. We propose a model of implicit learning, or more generally, learning to reason, which bypasses the intractable step of producing an explicit representation of the learned knowledge. We show that polynomial-time learnability results can be obtained when limited to knowledge bases and observations consisting of conjunctions of modal literals.",

        "abstract": "The prevailing thinking is that orthogonal weights are crucial to enforcing dynamical isometry and speeding up training. The increase in learning speed that results from orthogonal initialization in linear networks has been well-proven. However, while the same is believed to also hold for nonlinear networks when the dynamical isometry condition is satisfied, the training dynamics behind this contention have not been thoroughly explored. In this work, we study the dynamics of ultra-wide networks across a range of architectures, including Fully Connected Networks (FCNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with orthogonal initialization via neural tangent kernel (NTK). Through a series of propositions and lemmas, we prove that two NTKs, one corresponding to Gaussian weights and one to orthogonal weights, are equal when the network width is infinite. Further, during training, the NTK of an orthogonally-initialized infinite-width network should theoretically remain constant. This suggests that the orthogonal initialization cannot speed up training in the NTK (lazy training) regime, contrary to the prevailing thoughts. In order to explore under what circumstances can orthogonality accelerate training, we conduct a thorough empirical investigation outside the NTK regime. We find that when the hyper-parameters are set to achieve a linear regime in nonlinear activation, orthogonal initialization can improve the learning speed with a large learning rate or large depth.",

A fundamental task in data science is to learn a Bayesian network from observed data. Polytree Learning is the problem of learning an optimal Bayesian network that fulfills the additional property that its underlying undirected graph is a forest. In this work, we revisit the complexity of Polytree Learning. We show that Polytree Learning can be solved in single-exponential FPT time for the number of variables. Moreover, we consider the influence of d, the number of variables that might receive a nonempty parent set in the final DAG on the complexity of Polytree Learning. We show that Polytree Learning is presumably not fixed-parameter tractable for d, unlike Bayesian network learning which is fixed-parameter tractable for d. Finally, we show that if d and the maximum parent set size are bounded, then we can obtain efficient algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Approximation Fixpoint Theory (AFT) and Justification Theory (JT) are two frameworks to unify logical formalisms. AFT studies semantics in terms of fixpoints of lattice operators, and JT in terms of so-called justifications, which are explanations of why certain facts do or do not hold in a model. While the approaches differ, the frameworks were designed with similar goals in mind, namely to study the different semantics that arise in (mainly) non-monotonic logics. The First contribution of our current paper is to provide a formal link between the two frameworks. To be precise, we show that every justification frame induces an approximator and that this mapping from JT to AFT preserves all major semantics. The second contribution exploits this correspondence to extend JT with a novel class of semantics, namely ultimate semantics: we formally show that ultimate semantics can be obtained in JT by a syntactic transformation on the justification frame, essentially performing some sort of resolution on the rules.",

To empower robots with this ability in unseen scenarios, we consider the challenging one-shot affordance detection problem in this paper, i.e., given a support image that depicts the action purpose, all objects in a scene with the common affordance should be detected. To this end, we devise a One-Shot Affordance Detection (OS-AD) network that firstly estimates the purpose and then transfers it to help detect the common affordance from all candidate images. Through collaboration learning, OS-AD can capture the common characteristics between objects having the same underlying affordance and learn a good adaptation capability for perceiving unseen affordances. Besides, we build a Purpose-driven Affordance Dataset (PAD) by collecting and labeling 4k images from 31 affordance and 72 object categories. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model over previous representative ones in terms of both objective metrics and visual quality. The benchmark suite is at  ProjectPage.",

However, most existing methodologies for sequential modeling overlook the intrinsic structure information of web pages. In this paper, we adopt multi-scale behavior sequence generated from different granularities of web page structures and propose a model named SAH-RNN to consume the multi-scale behavior sequence for online payment fraud detection. The SAH-RNN has stacked RNN layers in which upper layers modeling for compendious behaviors are updated less frequently and receive the summarized representations from lower layers. A dual attention is devised to capture the impacts on both sequential information within the same sequence and structural information among different granularity of web pages. Experimental results on a large-scale real-world transaction dataset from Alibaba show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Most state-of-the-art methods perform this learning offline from an input set of plan traces generated by the execution of (successful) plans.  However, how to generate informative plan traces for learning action models is still an open issue. Moreover, plan traces might not be available for a new environment. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for learning action models online, incrementally during the execution of plans. Such plans are generated to achieve goals that the algorithm decides online in order to obtain informative plan traces and reach states from which useful information can be learned. We show some fundamental theoretical properties of the algorithm, and we experimentally evaluate the online learning of the action models over a large set of IPC domains.",

Compared with previous offline algorithms, which require \u2126(T) space, our online algorithm only requires O( \u221a T) space.

        "abstract": "Accurately discovering user intents from their written or spoken language plays a critical role in natural language understanding and automated dialog response. Most existing research models this as a classification task with a single intent label per utterance. Going beyond this formulation, we define and investigate a new problem of open intent discovery. It involves discovering one or more generic intent types from text utterances, that may not have been encountered during training. We propose a novel, domain-agnostic approach, OPINE, which formulates the problem as a sequence tagging task in an open-world setting. It employs a CRF on top of a bidirectional LSTM to extract intents in a consistent format, subject to constraints among intent tag labels. We apply multi-headed self-attention and adversarial training to effectively learn dependencies between distant words, and robustly adapt our model across varying domains. We also curate and release an intent-annotated dataset of 25K real-life utterances spanning diverse domains. Extensive experiments show that OPINE outperforms state-of-art baselines by 5-15% F1 score.",

        "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as bio-inspired energy-efficient neural networks, have attracted great attentions from researchers and industry. The most efficient way to train deep SNNs is through ANN-SNN conversion. However, the conversion usually suffers from accuracy loss and long inference time, which impede the practical application of SNN. In this paper, we theoretically analyze ANN-SNN conversion and derive sufficient conditions of the optimal conversion. To better correlate ANN-SNN and get greater accuracy, we propose Rate Norm Layer to replace the ReLU activation function in source ANN training, enabling direct conversion from a trained ANN to an SNN. Moreover, we propose an optimal fit curve to quantify the fit between the activation value of source ANN and the actual firing rate of target SNN. We show that the inference time can be reduced by optimizing the upper bound of the fit curve in the revised ANN to achieve fast inference. Our theory can explain the existing work on fast reasoning and get better results. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves near loss-less conversion with VGG-16, PreActResNet-18, and deeper structures. Moreover, it can reach 8.6\u00d7 faster reasoning performance under 0.265\u00d7 energy consumption of the typical method.

        "abstract": "This paper studies a multi-armed bandit (MAB) version of the range-searching problem. In its basic form, range searching considers as input a set of points (on the real line) and a collection of (real) intervals. Here, with each specified point, we have an associated weight, and the problem objective is to find a maximum-weight point within every given interval. The current work addresses range searching with stochastic weights: each point corresponds to an arm (that admits sample access) and the point's weight is the (unknown) mean of the underlying distribution. In this MAB setup, we develop sample-efficient algorithms that find, with high probability, near-optimal arms within the given intervals, i.e., we obtain  PAC (probably approximately correct) guarantees. We also provide an algorithm for a generalization wherein the weight of each point is a multi-dimensional vector. The sample complexities of our algorithms depend, in particular, on the size of the {optimal hitting set} of the given intervals. Finally, we establish lower bounds proving that the obtained sample complexities are essentially tight. Our results highlight the significance of geometric constructs (specifically, hitting sets) in our MAB setting.",

However, searching the space of directed graphs and enforcing acyclicity by implicit penalties tend to be inefficient and restrict the existing RL-based method to small scale problems. \r\nIn this work, we propose a novel RL-based approach for causal discovery, by incorporating RL into the ordering-based paradigm.\r\nSpecifically, we  formulate the ordering search problem as a multi-step Markov decision process, implement the ordering generating process with an encoder-decoder architecture, and finally use \r\nRL to optimize the proposed model based on the reward mechanisms designed for each ordering. \r\nA generated ordering would then be processed using variable selection to obtain the final causal graph. \r\nWe  analyze the consistency and computational complexity of  the proposed method, and empirically show that a pretrained model can be exploited to accelerate training. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets shows  that the proposed method achieves a much improved performance over existing RL-based method.",

Our PIANO model is biologically correct, simple to animate, and differentiable, achieving more anatomically precise modeling of the inner hand kinematic structure in a data-driven manner than the traditional hand models based on the outer surface only. Furthermore, our PIANO model can be applied in neural network layers to enable training with a fine-grained semantic loss, which opens up the new task of data-driven fine-grained hand bone anatomic and semantic understanding from MRI or even RGB images.

We extend this result to show that a PROPm allocation is guaranteed to exist for all instances, independent of the number of agents or goods. Our proof is constructive, providing an algorithm that computes such an allocation and, unlike prior work, the running time of this algorithm is polynomial in both the number of agents and the number of goods.",

However, transferable, generalizable, and robust representation learning on graph data still remains a challenge for pre-training graph neural networks. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective self-supervised pre-training strategy, named Pairwise Half-graph Discrimination (PHD), that explicitly pre-trains a graph neural network at graph-level. PHD is designed as a simple binary classification task to discriminate whether two half-graphs come from the same source. Experiments demonstrate that the PHD is an effective pre-training strategy that offers comparable or superior performance on 13 graph classification tasks compared with state-of-the-art strategies, and achieves notable improvements when combined with node-level strategies. Moreover, the visualization of learned representation revealed that PHD strategy indeed empowers the model to learn graph-level knowledge like the molecular scaffold. These results have established PHD as a powerful and effective self-supervised learning strategy in graph-level representation learning.",

Due to the presence of other irrelevant labels, vanilla multi-label learning methods are prone to be misled and fail to generalize well on unseen data, thus how to enable them to get rid of the noisy labels turns to be the core problem of partial multi-label learning. In this paper, we propose the Partial Multi-Label Optimal margin Distribution Machine (PML-ODM), which distinguishs the noisy labels through explicitly optimizing the distribution of ranking margin, and exhibits better generalization performance than minimum margin based counterparts. In addition, we propose a novel feature prototype representation to further enhance the disambiguation ability, and the non-linear kernels can also be applied to promote the generalization performance for linearly inseparable data. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets validates the superiority of our proposed method.",

        "abstract": "We study a generalization of the standard approval-based model of participatory budgeting (PB), in which voters are providing approval ballots over a set of predefined projects and---in addition to a global budget limit---there are several groupings of the projects, each group with its own budget limit. We study the computational complexity of identifying project bundles that maximize voter satisfaction while respecting all budget limits. We show that the problem is generally intractable and describe efficient exact algorithms for several special cases, including instances with only few groups and instances where the group structure is close to being hierarchical, as well as efficient approximation algorithms. Our results could allow, e.g., municipalities to hold richer PB processes that are thematically and geographically inclusive.",

        "abstract": "Probabilistic graphical models have emerged as a powerful modeling tool for several real-world scenarios where one needs to reason under uncertainty. A graphical model's partition function is a central quantity of interest, and its computation is key to several probabilistic reasoning tasks. Given the #P-hardness of computing the partition function, several techniques have been proposed over the years with varying guarantees on the quality of estimates and their runtime behavior. This paper seeks to present a survey of 18 techniques and a rigorous empirical study of their behavior across an extensive set of benchmarks. Our empirical study draws up a surprising observation: exact techniques are as efficient as the approximate ones, and therefore, we conclude with an optimistic view of opportunities for the design of approximate techniques with enhanced scalability. Motivated by the observation of an order of magnitude difference between the Virtual Best Solver and the best performing tool, we envision an exciting line of research focused on the development of portfolio solvers.",

        "abstract": "Sequential recommendation aims to predict users\u2019 future behaviors given their historical interactions. However, due to the randomness and diversity of a user\u2019s behaviors, not all historical items are informative to tell his/her next choice. It is obvious that identifying relevant items and extracting meaningful sequential patterns are necessary for a better recommendation. Unfortunately, few works have focused on this sequence denoising process.\r\nIn this paper, we propose a PatteRn-enhanced ContrAstive Policy Learning Network (RAP for short) for sequential recommendation, RAP formalizes the denoising problem in the form of Markov Decision Process (MDP), and sample actions for each item to determine whether it is relevant with the target item. To tackle the lack of relevance supervision, RAP fuses a series of mined sequential patterns into the policy learning process, which work as a prior knowledge to guide the denoising process. After that, RAP splits the initial item sequence into two disjoint subsequences: a positive subsequence and a negative subsequence. At this, a novel contrastive learning mechanism is introduced to guide the sequence denoising and achieve preference estimation from the positive subsequence simultaneously. Extensive experiments on four public real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for sequential recommendation.",

Person search aims to find a probe person in a gallery of scene images with a wide range of applications, such as criminals search, multicamera tracking, missing person search, etc. Early person search works focused on image-based person search, which uses person image as the search query. Text-based person search is another major person search category that uses free-form natural language as the search query. Person search is challenging, and corresponding solutions are diverse and complex. Therefore, systematic surveys on this topic are essential. This paper surveyed the recent works on image-based and text-based person search from the perspective of challenges and solutions. Specifically, we provide a brief analysis of highly influential person search methods considering the three significant challenges: the discriminative person features, the query-person gap, and the detection-identification inconsistency. We summarise and compare evaluation results. Finally, we discuss open issues and some promising future research directions.",

        "abstract": "Recent semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods are predominantly focused on multi-class classification tasks. Classification tasks allow for easy mixing of class labels during augmentation which does not trivially extend to structured outputs such as word sequences that appear in tasks like image captioning. Noisy Student Training is a recent SSL paradigm proposed for image classification that is an extension of self-training and teacher-student learning. In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of the noisy student SSL framework for the task of image captioning and derive state-of-the-art results. The original algorithm relies on computationally expensive data augmentation steps that involve perturbing the raw images and computing features for each perturbed image. We show that, even in the absence of raw image augmentation, the use of simple model and feature perturbations to the input images for the student model are beneficial to SSL training. We also show how a paraphrase generator could be effectively used for label augmentation to improve the quality of pseudo labels and significantly improve performance. Our final results in the limited labeled data setting (1% of the MS-COCO labeled data) outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches by 2.5 on BLEU4 and 11.5 on CIDEr scores.",

An LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network is trained to associate the phonetic representation of a concrete word, encoded as a sequence of feature vectors, to the visual representation of its referent, expressed as an HCNN-transformed image. The processing network is then tested, without further training, in a language that does not appear in the training set and belongs to a different language family. The performance of the model is evaluated through a comparison with a randomized baseline; we show that such an imaginative network is capable of extracting language-independent generalizations in the mapping from linguistic sounds to visual features, providing empirical support for the hypothesis of a universal sound-symbolic substrate underlying all languages.",

        "abstract": "Modeling the dynamics of real-world physical systems is critical for spatiotemporal prediction tasks, but challenging when data is limited. The scarcity of real-world data and the difficulty in reproducing the data distribution hinder directly applying meta-learning techniques. Although the knowledge of governing partial differential equations (PDE) of the data can be helpful for the fast adaptation to few observations, it is mostly infeasible to exactly find the equation for observations in real-world physical systems. In this work, we propose a framework, physics-aware meta-learning with auxiliary tasks, whose spatial modules incorporate PDE-independent knowledge and temporal modules utilize the generalized features from the spatial modules to be adapted to the limited data, respectively. The framework is inspired by a local conservation law expressed mathematically as a continuity equation and does not require the exact form of governing equation to model the spatiotemporal observations. The proposed method mitigates the need for a large number of real-world tasks for meta-learning by leveraging spatial information in simulated data to meta-initialize the spatial modules. We apply the proposed framework to both synthetic and real-world spatiotemporal prediction tasks and demonstrate its superior performance with limited observations.",

        "abstract": "Dynamical systems are typically governed by a set of linear/nonlinear differential equations. Distilling the analytical form of these equations from very limited data remains intractable in many disciplines such as physics, biology, climate science, engineering and social science. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel Physics-informed Spline Learning (PiSL) framework to discover parsimonious governing equations for nonlinear dynamics, based on sparsely sampled noisy data. The key concept is to (1) leverage splines to interpolate locally the dynamics, perform analytical differentiation and build the library of candidate terms, (2) employ sparse representation of the governing equations, and (3) use the physics residual in turn to inform the spline learning. The synergy between splines and discovered underlying physics leads to the robust capacity of dealing with high-level data scarcity and noise. A hybrid sparsity-promoting alternating direction optimization strategy is developed for systematically pruning the sparse coefficients that form the structure and explicit expression of the governing equations. The efficacy and superiority of the proposed method have been demonstrated by multiple well-known nonlinear dynamical systems, in comparison with two state-of-the-art methods.",

In addition, we provide characterizations of picking sequences satisfying each of the fairness notions, and show that the well-studied maximum Nash welfare solution fails resource- and population-monotonicity even in the unweighted setting. Our results serve as an argument in favor of using picking sequences in weighted fair division problems.",

        "abstract": "Point cloud registration is a fundamental problem in 3D computer vision. In this paper, we cast point cloud registration into a planning problem in reinforcement learning, which can seek the transformation between the source and target point clouds through trial and error. By modeling the point cloud registration process as a Markov decision process (MDP), we develop a latent dynamic model of point clouds, consisting of a transformation network and evaluation network. The transformation network aims to predict the new transformed feature of the point cloud after performing a rigid transformation (i.e., action) on it while the evaluation network aims to predict the alignment precision between the transformed source point cloud and target point cloud as the reward signal. Once the dynamic model of the point cloud is trained, we employ the cross-entropy method (CEM) to iteratively update the planning policy by maximizing the rewards in the point cloud registration process. Thus, the optimal policy, i.e., the transformation between the source and target point clouds, can be obtained via gradually narrowing the search space of the transformation. Experimental results on ModelNet40 and 7Scene benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can yield good registration performance in an unsupervised manner.",

We use discrete Laplacian-based surface encoders and approximate the neighborhood of each point using a shared multi-layer perceptron. We show that our formulation is permutation invariant and present a neural network that computes the scattering function using spherical harmonics. Our approach can handle objects with arbitrary topologies and deforming models, and takes less than 1ms per object on a commodity GPU. We have analyzed the accuracy and perform validation on thousands of unseen 3D objects and highlight the benefits over other point-based geometric deep learning methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-time learning algorithm that can approximate the acoustic scattering properties of arbitrary objects with high accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Point Cloud Sampling and Recovery (PCSR) is critical for massive real-time point cloud collection and processing since raw data usually requires large storage and computation. This paper addresses a fundamental problem in PCSR: How to downsample the dense point cloud with arbitrary scales while preserving the local topology of discarded points in a case-agnostic manner (i.e., without additional storage for point relationships)? We propose a novel Locally Invertible Embedding (PointLIE) framework to unify the point cloud sampling and upsampling into one single framework through bi-directional learning. Specifically, PointLIE decouples the local geometric relationships between discarded points from the sampled points by progressively encoding the neighboring offsets to a latent variable. Once the latent variable is forced to obey a pre-defined distribution in the forward sampling path, the recovery can be achieved effectively through inverse operations. Taking the recover-pleasing sampled points and a latent embedding randomly drawn from the specified distribution as inputs, PointLIE can theoretically guarantee the fidelity of reconstruction and outperform state-of-the-arts quantitatively and qualitatively.",

These algorithms, however, often cannot be directly applied to physical systems, especially in cases where there are constraints to satisfy (e.g. to ensure safety or limit resource consumption). In standard RL, the agent is incentivized to explore any policy with the sole goal of maximizing reward; in the real world, however, ensuring satisfaction of certain constraints in the process is also necessary and essential. In this article, we overview existing approaches addressing constraints in model-free reinforcement learning. We model the problem of learning with constraints as a Constrained Markov Decision Process and consider two main types of constraints: cumulative and instantaneous. We summarize existing approaches and discuss their pros and cons. To evaluate policy performance under constraints, we introduce a set of standard benchmarks and metrics. We also summarize limitations of current methods and present open questions for future research.",

Since its latest stable version, the SMT-LIB standard defines a theory of algebraic datatypes, which is currently supported by several mainstream SMT solvers. In this paper, we study this particular theory of datatypes and prove that it is strongly polite, showing also how it can be combined with other arbitrary disjoint theories using polite combination. Our results cover both inductive and finite datatypes, as well as their union. The combination method uses a new, simple, and natural notion of additivity, that enables deducing strong politeness from (weak) politeness.",

        "abstract": "Polynomial-time heuristic functions for planning are commonplace since 20 years. But polynomial-time in which input? Almost all existing approaches are based on a grounded task representation, not on the actual PDDL input which is exponentially smaller. This limits practical applicability to cases where the grounded representation is \"small enough\". Previous attempts to tackle this problem for the delete relaxation leveraged symmetries to reduce the blow-up. Here we take a more radical approach, applying an additional relaxation to obtain a heuristic function that runs in time polynomial in the size of the PDDL input. Our relaxation splits the predicates into smaller predicates of fixed arity K. We show that computing a relaxed plan is still NP-hard (in PDDL input size) for K>=2, but is polynomial-time for K=1. We implement a heuristic function for K=1 and show that it can improve the state of the art on benchmarks whose grounded representation is large.",

        "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in the 3D human pose estimation task, since the pose representation of a human body can be naturally modeled by the graph structure. Generally, most of the existing GNN-based models utilize the restricted receptive \ufb01elds of \ufb01lters and single-scale information, while neglecting the valuable multi-scale contextual information. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Graph Transformer Encoder-Decoder with Atrous Convolution, named PoseGTAC, to effectively extract multi-scale context and long-range information. In our proposed PoseGTAC model, Graph Atrous Convolution (GAC) and Graph Transformer Layer (GTL), respectively for the extraction of local multi-scale and global long-range information, are combined and stacked in an encoder-decoder structure, where graph pooling and unpooling are adopted for the interaction of multi-scale information from local to global (e.g., part-scale and body-scale). Extensive experiments on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets demonstrate that the proposed PoseGTAC model exceeds all previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

Existing PU methods perform well on the balanced dataset. However, in real applications such as financial fraud detection or medical diagnosis, data are always imbalanced. It remains unclear whether existing PU methods can perform well on imbalanced data. In this paper, we explore this problem and propose a general learning objective for PU learning targeting specially at imbalanced data. By this general learning objective, state-of-the-art PU methods based on optimizing a consistent risk can be adapted to conquer the imbalance. We theoretically show that in expectation, optimizing our learning objective is equivalent to learning a classifier on the oversampled balanced data with both P and N data available, and further provide an estimation error bound. Finally, experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposal compared to state-of-the-art PU methods.",

However, existing one-shot algorithms only support specific models and do not provide any privacy guarantees, which significantly limit the applications in practice. In this paper, we propose a practical one-shot federated learning algorithm named FedKT.

        "abstract": "Many efforts are devoted to predicting congestion evolution using propagation patterns that are mined from historical traffic data.\r\nHowever, the prediction quality is limited to the intrinsic properties that are present in the mined patterns. In addition, these mined patterns frequently fail to sufficiently capture many realistic characteristics of true congestion evolution (e.g., asymmetric transitivity, local proximity). In this paper, we propose a representation learning framework to characterize and predict congestion evolution between any pair of road segments (connected via single or multiple paths). Specifically, we build dynamic attributed networks (DAN) to incorporate both dynamic and static impact factors while preserving dynamic topological structures. We propose a Deep Meta Learning Model (DMLM) for learning representations of road segments which support accurate prediction of congestion evolution. DMLM relies on matrix factorization techniques and meta-LSTM modules to exploit temporal correlations at multiple scales, and employ meta-Attention modules to merge heterogeneous features while learning the time-varying impacts of both dynamic and static features. Compared to all state-of-the-art methods, our framework achieves significantly better prediction performance on two congestion evolution behaviors (propagation and decay) when evaluated using real-world dataset.",

One of the most important solutions to maintain social distancing is to monitor the crowdedness of indoor and outdoor points of interest. Using Nanyang Technological University (NTU) as a testbed, we develop and deploy a platform that provides live and predicted crowd counts for key locations on campus to help users plan their trips in an informed manner, so as to mitigate the risk of community transmission.",

        "abstract": "Capacity management has always been a great challenge for cloud platforms due to massive, heterogeneous on-demand instances running at different times. To better plan the capacity for the whole platform, a class of cloud computing instances have been released to collect computing demands beforehand. To use such instances, users are allowed to submit jobs to run for a pre-specified uninterrupted duration in a flexible range of time in the future with a discount compared to the normal on-demand instances. Proactively scheduling those pre-collected job requests considering the capacity status over the platform can greatly help balance the computing workloads along time. In this work, we formulate the scheduling problem for these pre-collected job requests under uncertain available capacity as a Prediction + Optimization problem with uncertainty in constraints, and propose an effective algorithm called Controlling under Uncertain Constraints (CUC), where the predicted capacity guides the optimization of job scheduling and job scheduling results are leveraged to improve the prediction of capacity through Bayesian optimization. The proposed formulation and solution are commonly applicable for proactively scheduling problems in cloud computing. Our extensive experiments on three public, industrial datasets shows that CUC has great potential for supporting high reliability in cloud platforms.",

        "abstract": "In recommender systems, the cold-start problem is a critical issue. To alleviate this problem, an emerging direction adopts meta-learning frameworks and achieves success. Most existing works aim to learn globally shared prior knowledge across all users so that it can be quickly adapted to a new user with sparse interactions. However, globally shared prior knowledge may be inadequate to discern users\u2019 complicated behaviors and causes poor generalization. Therefore, we argue that prior knowledge should be locally shared by users with similar preferences who can be recognized by social relations. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Preference-Adaptive Meta-Learning approach (PAML) to improve existing meta-learning frameworks with better generalization capacity. Specifically, to address two challenges imposed by social relations, we first identify reliable implicit friends to strengthen a user\u2019s social relations based on our defined palindrome paths. Then, a coarse-fine preference modeling method is proposed to leverage social relations and capture the preference. Afterwards, a novel preference-specific adapter is designed to adapt the globally shared prior knowledge to the preference-specific knowledge so that users who have similar tastes share similar knowledge. We conduct extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets. Experimental results validate the power of social relations and the effectiveness of PAML.",

        "abstract": "We study the differentially private (DP) stochastic nonconvex optimization with a focus on its under-studied utility measures in terms of the expected excess empirical and population risks. While the excess risks are extensively studied for convex optimization, they are rarely studied for nonconvex optimization, especially the expected population risk. For the convex case, recent studies show that it is possible for private optimization to achieve the same order of excess population risk as to the nonprivate optimization under certain conditions. It still remains an open question for the nonconvex case whether such ideal excess population risk is achievable.\r\n  \r\nIn this paper, we progress towards an affirmative answer to this open problem: DP nonconvex optimization is indeed capable of achieving the same excess population risk as to the nonprivate algorithm in most common parameter regimes, under certain conditions (i.e., well-conditioned nonconvexity). We achieve such improved utility rates compared to existing results by designing and analyzing the stagewise DP-SGD with early momentum algorithm. We obtain both excess empirical risk and excess population risk to achieve differential privacy. Our algorithm also features the first known results of excess and population risks for DP-SGD with momentum. Experiment results on both shallow and deep neural networks when respectively applied to simple and complex real datasets corroborate the theoretical results.",

That is, sufficient to give us strong probabilistic guarantees that the model will behave similarly when all features are observed under the data distribution. In addition, we leverage tractable probabilistic reasoning tools such as probabilistic circuits and expected predictions to design a scalable algorithm for finding the desired explanations while keeping the guarantees intact. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in finding sufficient explanations, and showcase its advantages compared to Anchors and logical explanations.",

        "abstract": "Given a specification \u03c6(X, Y ) over inputs X and output Y and defined over a background theory T, the problem of program synthesis is to design a program f such that Y = f (X), satisfies the specification \u03c6. Over the past decade, syntax-guided synthesis (SyGuS) has emerged as a dominant approach to program synthesis where in addition to the specification \u03c6, the end-user also specifies a grammar L to aid the underlying synthesis engine. This paper investigates the feasibility of synthesis techniques without grammar, a sub-class defined as T constrained synthesis. We show that T-constrained synthesis can be reduced to DQF(T),i.e., to the problem of finding a witness of a dependency quantified formula modulo theory. When the underlying theory is the theory of bitvectors, the corresponding DQF problem can be further reduced to Dependency Quantified Boolean Formulas (DQBF). We rely on the progress in DQBF solving to design DQBF-based synthesizers that outperform the domain-specific program synthesis techniques; thereby positioning DQBF as a core representation language for program synthesis. Our empirical analysis shows that T-constrained synthesis can achieve significantly better performance than syntax-guided approaches. Furthermore, the general-purpose DQBF solvers perform on par with domain-specific synthesis techniques.",

However, existing methods can generate responses with only one controllable attribute or lack a flexible way to generate them with multiple controllable attributes.  In this paper, we propose a Progressively trained Hierarchical Encoder-Decoder (PHED) to tackle this task.  More specifically, PHED deploys Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (CVAE) on Transformer to include one aspect of attributes at one stage.  A vital characteristic of the CVAE is to separate the latent variables at each stage into two types: a global variable capturing the common semantic features and a specific variable absorbing the attribute information at that stage.  PHED then couples the CVAE latent variables with the Transformer encoder and is trained by minimizing a newly derived ELBO and controlled losses to produce the next stage's input and produce responses as required.  Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations to show that PHED significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art neural generation models and produces more diverse responses as expected.",

However, it has not been widely used in many downstream tasks because it suffers 1) two-stage methods exist heavy computation cost and inevitable error accumulation, and 2) one-stage methods have to depend on lots of hyper-parameters (such as anchors) to generate bounding box. In this paper, we present a proposal-free one-stage (PFOS) model that is able to regress the region-of-interest from the image, based on a textual query, in an end-to-end manner. Instead of using the dominant anchor proposal fashion, we directly take the dense-grid of image as input for a cross-attention transformer that learns grid-word correspondences. The final bounding box is predicted directly from the image without the time-consuming anchor selection process that previous methods suffer. Our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on four referring expression datasets with higher efficiency, comparing to previous best one-stage and two-stage methods.",

Such shifts can be viewed as interventions on a causal graph, which capture (possibly hypothetical) changes in the data-generating process, whether due to natural reasons or by the action of an adversary. We consider causal Bayesian networks and formally define the interventional robustness problem, a novel model-based notion of robustness for decision functions that measures worst-case performance with respect to a set of interventions that denote changes to parameters and/or causal influences. By relying on a tractable representation of Bayesian networks as arithmetic circuits, we provide efficient algorithms for computing guaranteed upper and lower bounds on the interventional robustness probabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that the methods yield useful and interpretable bounds for a range of practical networks, paving the way towards provably causally robust decision-making systems.",

Besides, these methods are only suitable for shallow SNNs. In this paper, inspired by synaptogenesis and synapse elimination in the neural system, we propose gradient rewiring (Grad R), a joint learning algorithm of connectivity and weight for SNNs, that enables us to seamlessly optimize network structure without retraining. Our key innovation is to redefine the gradient to a new synaptic parameter, allowing better exploration of network structures by taking full advantage of the competition between pruning and regrowth of connections. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves minimal loss of SNNs' performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets so far. Moreover, it reaches a ~3.5% accuracy loss under unprecedented 0.73% connectivity, which reveals remarkable structure refining capability in SNNs. Our work suggests that there exists extremely high redundancy in deep SNNs. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Yanqi-Chen/Gradient-Rewiring.",

While similar elections are grouped together on this map, there is no obvious interpretation of the elections' positions. We provide such an interpretation by introducing four canonical \u201cextreme\u201d elections, acting as a compass on the map. We use them to analyze both a dataset provided by Szufa et al. and a number of real-life elections. In effect, we find a new parameterization of the Mallows model, based on measuring the expected swap distance from the central preference order, and show that it is useful for capturing real-life scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Unsupervised anomaly detection plays a crucial role in many critical applications. Driven by the success of deep learning, recent years have witnessed growing interests in applying deep neural networks (DNNs) to anomaly detection problems. A common approach is using autoencoders to learn a feature representation for the normal observations in the data. The reconstruction error of the autoencoder is then used as outlier scores to detect the anomalies. However, due to the high complexity brought upon by the over-parameterization of DNNs, the reconstruction error of the anomalies could also be small, which hampers the effectiveness of these methods. To alleviate this problem, we propose a robust framework using collaborative autoencoders to jointly identify normal observations from the data while learning its feature representation. We investigate the theoretical properties of the framework and empirically show its outstanding performance as compared to other DNN-based methods. Our experimental results also show the resiliency of the framework to missing values compared to other baseline methods.",

        "abstract": "Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection devotes to learn how humans interact with surrounding objects. Latest end-to-end HOI detectors are short of relation reasoning, which leads to inability to learn HOI-specific interactive semantics for predictions. In this paper, we therefore propose novel relation reasoning for HOI detection. We first present a progressive Relation-aware Frame, which brings a new structure and parameter sharing pattern for interaction inference. Upon the frame, an Interaction Intensifier Module and a Correlation Parsing Module are carefully designed, where: a) interactive semantics from humans can be exploited and passed to objects to intensify interactions, b) interactive correlations among humans, objects and interactions are integrated to promote predictions. Based on modules above, we construct an end-to-end trainable framework named Relation Reasoning Network (abbr. RR-Net). Extensive experiments show that our proposed RR-Net sets a new state-of-the-art on both V-COCO and HICO-DET benchmarks and improves the baseline about 5.5% and 9.8% relatively, validating that this first effort in exploring relation reasoning and integrating interactive semantics has brought obvious improvement for end-to-end HOI detection.",

We obtain extension-based semantics as a special case of this new approach, but it also allows us to make more fine-grained distinctions, such as one set being \"more complete'' or \"more admissible'' than another.  We define a number of general principles to classify extension-ranking semantics and develop concrete approaches.

        "abstract": "When demand increases beyond the system capacity, riders in ride-hailing/ride-sharing systems often experience long waiting time, resulting in poor customer satisfaction. This paper proposes a spatio-temporal pricing framework (AP-RTRS) to alleviate this challenge and shows how it naturally complements state-of-the-art dispatching and routing algorithms. Specifically, the pricing  optimization model regulates demand to ensure that every rider opting to use the system is served within reason-able time: it does so either by reducing demand to meet the capacity constraints or by prompting potential riders to postpone service to a later time. The pricing model is a model-predictive control algorithm that works at a coarser temporal and spatial granularity compared to the real-time dispatching and routing, and naturally integrates vehicle relocations. Simulation experiments indicate that the pricing optimization model achieves short waiting times without sacrificing revenues and geographical fairness.",

        "abstract": "In a recent paper Belle and Lakemeyer proposed the logic DS, a probabilistic extension of a modal variant of the situation calculus with a model of belief based on weighted possible worlds. Among other things, they were able to precisely capture the beliefs of a probabilistic knowledge base in terms of the concept of only-believing. While intuitively appealing, the logic has a number of shortcomings. Perhaps the most severe is the limited expressiveness in that degrees of belief are restricted to constant rational numbers, which makes it impossible to express arbitrary belief distributions.\r\n\r\nIn this paper we will address this and other shortcomings by extending the language and modifying the semantics of belief and only-believing.  Among other things, we will show that belief retains many but not all of the properties of DS.  Moreover, it turns out that only-believing arbitrary sentences, including those mentioning belief, is uniquely satisfiable in our logic.   For an interesting class of knowledge bases we also show how reasoning about beliefs and meta-beliefs after performing noisy actions and sensing can be reduced to reasoning about the initial beliefs of an agent using a form of regression.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is widely used in decision making procedures in myriads of real-world applications across important practical areas such as finance, healthcare, education, and safety critical systems. Due to its ubiquitous use in safety and privacy critical domains, it is often vital to understand the reasoning behind the AI decisions, which motivates the need for explainable AI (XAI). One of the major approaches to XAI is represented by computing so-called interpretable machine learning (ML) models, such as decision trees (DT), decision lists (DL) and decision sets (DS). These models build on the use of if-then rules and are thus deemed to be easily understandable by humans. A number of approaches have been proposed in the recent past to devising all kinds of interpretable ML models, the most prominent of which involve encoding the problem into a logic formalism, which is then tackled by invoking a reasoning or discrete optimization procedure. This paper overviews the recent advances of the reasoning and constraints based approaches to learning interpretable ML models and discusses their advantages and limitations.",

To address this problem, recent research developments can fall into three major categories: social recommendation, knowledge graph-enhanced recommender system, and multi-behavior recommendation. We discuss the learning approaches in each category, such as matrix factorization, attention mechanism and graph neural networks, for effectively distilling heterogeneous contextual information.

However,\r\n  PSRs notoriously ignore the notion of rewards, which undermines the general\r\n  utility of PSR models for control, planning, or reinforcement learning.\r\n  Therefore, we describe a sufficient and necessary accuracy condition\r\n  which determines whether a PSR is able to accurately model POMDP rewards, we\r\n  show that rewards can be approximated even when the accuracy condition is not\r\n  satisfied, and we find that a non-trivial number of POMDPs taken from a\r\n  well-known third-party repository do not satisfy the accuracy condition.  \r\n  We propose reward-predictive state representations (R-PSRs), a\r\n  generalization of PSRs which accurately models both observations and rewards,\r\n  and develop value iteration for R-PSRs.

        "abstract": "The bus system is a critical component of sustainable urban transportation. However, due to the significant uncertainties in passenger demand and traffic conditions, bus operation is unstable in nature and bus bunching has become a common phenomenon that undermines the reliability and efficiency of bus services. Despite recent advances in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) on traffic control, little research has focused on bus fleet control due to the tricky asynchronous characteristic---control actions only happen when a bus arrives at a bus stop and thus agents do not act simultaneously. In this study, we formulate route-level bus fleet control as an asynchronous multi-agent reinforcement learning (ASMR) problem and extend the classical actor-critic architecture to handle the asynchronous issue. Specifically, we design a novel critic network to effectively approximate the marginal contribution for other agents, in which graph attention neural network is used to conduct inductive learning for policy evaluation. The critic structure also helps the ego agent optimize its policy more efficiently. We evaluate the proposed framework on real-world bus services and actual passenger demand derived from smart card data. Our results show that the proposed model outperforms both traditional headway-based control methods and existing MARL methods.",

To address this problem, this work proposes a novel Meta Functional Learning (MFL) by meta-learning a generalisable functional model from data-rich tasks whilst simultaneously regularising knowledge transfer to data-scarce tasks. The MFL computes meta-knowledge on functional regularisation generalisable to different learning tasks by which functional training on limited labelled data promotes more discriminative functions to be learned. Moreover, we adopt an Iterative Update strategy on MFL (MFL-IU). This improves knowledge transfer regularisation from MFL by progressively learning the functional regularisation in knowledge transfer. Experiments on three Few-Shot Learning (FSL) benchmarks (miniImageNet, CIFAR-FS and CUB) show that meta functional learning for regularisation knowledge transfer can benefit improving FSL classifiers.",

        "abstract": "As one of the most popular generative models, Variational Autoencoder (VAE) approximates the posterior of latent variables based on amortized variational inference. However, when the decoder network is sufficiently expressive, VAE may lead to posterior collapse; that is, uninformative latent representations may be learned. To this end, in this paper, we propose an alternative model, DU-VAE, for learning a more Diverse and less Uncertain latent space, and thus the representation can be learned in a meaningful and compact manner. Specifically, we first theoretically demonstrate that it will result in better latent space with high diversity and low uncertainty awareness by controlling the distribution of posterior\u2019s parameters across the whole data accordingly. Then, without the introduction of new loss terms or modifying training strategies, we propose to exploit Dropout on the variances and Batch-Normalization on the means simultaneously to regularize their distributions implicitly. Furthermore, to evaluate the generalization effect, we also exploit DU-VAE for inverse autoregressive flow based-VAE (VAE-IAF) empirically. Finally, extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets clearly show that our approach can outperform state-of-the-art baselines on both likelihood estimation and underlying classification tasks.",

        "abstract": "We explore the black-box adversarial attack on video recognition models.   Attacks are only performed on selected key regions and key frames to reduce the high computation cost of searching adversarial perturbations on a video due to its high dimensionality.   To select key frames, one way is to use heuristic algorithms to evaluate the importance of each frame and choose the essential ones. However, it is time inefficient on sorting and searching. In order to speed up the attack process, we propose a reinforcement learning based frame selection strategy. Specifically, the agent explores the difference between the original class and the target class of videos to make selection decisions. It receives rewards from threat models which indicate the quality of the decisions. Besides, we also use saliency detection to select key regions and only estimate the sign of gradient instead of the gradient itself in zeroth order optimization to further boost the attack process. We can use the trained model directly in the untargeted attack or with little fine-tune in the targeted attack, which saves computation time. A range of empirical results on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Application of deep learning to NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems is an emerging research trend, and a number of interesting approaches have been published over the last few years. In this work we address robust optimization, which is a more complex variant where a max-min problem is to be solved. We obtain robust solutions by solving the inner minimization problem exactly and apply Reinforcement Learning to learn a heuristic for the outer problem. The minimization term in the inner objective represents an obstacle to existing RL-based approaches, as its value depends on the full solution in a non-linear manner and cannot be evaluated for partial solutions constructed by the agent over the course of each episode. We overcome this obstacle by defining the reward in terms of the one-step advantage over a baseline policy whose role can be played by any fast heuristic for the given problem. The agent is trained to maximize the total advantage, which, as we show, is equivalent to the original objective. We validate our approach by solving min-max versions of standard benchmarks for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing and the Traveling Salesperson Problem, where our agents obtain near-optimal solutions and improve upon the baselines.",

        "abstract": "The core is a well-known and fundamental notion of stability in games intended to model coalition formation such as hedonic games. The fact that the number of deviating agents (that have to coordinate themselves) can be arbitrarily high, and the fact that agents may benefit only by a tiny amount from their deviation (while they could incur in a cost for deviating), suggest that the core is not able to suitably model many practical scenarios in large and highly distributed multi-agent systems. For this reason, we consider relaxed core stable outcomes where the notion of permissible deviations is modified along two orthogonal directions: the former takes into account the size of the deviating coalition, and the latter the amount of utility gain for each member of the deviating coalition. These changes result in two different notions of stability, namely, the q-size core and k-improvement core. We investigate these concepts of stability in fractional hedonic games, that is a well-known subclass of hedonic games for which core stable outcomes are not guaranteed to exist and it is computationally hard to decide nonemptiness of the core. Interestingly, the considered relaxed notions of core also possess the appealing property of recovering, in some notable cases, the convergence, the existence and the possibility of computing stable solutions in polynomial time.",

Specifically, the micro-lens dynamic filters are  proposed to \u2018seek\u2019 occluded background points in shifted micro-lens images and remove occlusions using angular information. The shifted images are then combined to further \u2018generate\u2019 background regions to supplement more background details using spatial information. By fully exploring the angular and spatial information in LFs, the dense and complex occlusions can be easily removed.

        "abstract": "Deep hashing methods have shown great retrieval accuracy and efficiency in large-scale image retrieval. How to optimize discrete hash bits is always the focus in deep hashing methods. A common strategy in these methods is to adopt an activation function, e.g. sigmoid() or tanh(), and minimize a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this paradigm may make more and more hash bits stuck into the wrong saturated area of the activation functions and never escaped. We call this problem \"Dead Bits Problem (DBP)\". Besides, the existing quantization loss will aggravate DBP as well. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective gradient amplifier which acts before activation functions to alleviate DBP. Moreover, we devise an error-aware quantization loss to further alleviate DBP. It avoids the negative effect of quantization loss based on the similarity between two images. The proposed gradient amplifier and error-aware quantization loss are compatible with a variety of deep hashing methods. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed gradient amplifier and the error-aware quantization loss.",

        "abstract": "An accurate short-term electric load forecasting is critical for modern electric power systems' safe and economical operation. \r\nElectric load forecasting can be formulated as a multi-variate time series problem. Residential houses in the same neighborhood may be affected by similar factors and share some latent spatial dependencies. However, most of the existing works on electric load forecasting fail to explore such dependencies. In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown impressive success in modeling such dependencies. However, such GNN based models usually would require a large amount of training data. We may have a minimal amount of data available to train a reliable forecasting model for houses in a new neighborhood area. At the same time, we may have a large amount of historical data collected from other houses that can be leveraged to improve the new neighborhood's prediction performance. In this paper, we propose an attentive transfer learning-based GNN model that can utilize the learned prior knowledge to improve the learning process in a new area.  The transfer process is achieved by an attention network, which generically avoids negative transfer by leveraging knowledge from multiple sources.\r\nExtensive experiments have been conducted on real-world data sets.  Results have shown that the proposed framework can consistently outperform baseline models in different areas.",

        "abstract": "Retrosynthesis, of which the goal is to find a set of reactants for synthesizing a target product, is an emerging research area of deep learning. While the existing approaches have shown promising results, they currently lack the ability to consider availability (e.g., stability or purchasability) of the reactants or generalize to unseen reaction templates (i.e., chemical reaction rules). In this paper, we propose a new approach that mitigates the issues by reformulating retrosynthesis into a selection problem of reactants from a candidate set of commercially available molecules. To this end, we design an efficient reactant selection framework, named RetCL (retrosynthesis via contrastive learning), for enumerating all of the candidate molecules based on selection scores computed by graph neural networks. For learning the score functions, we also propose a novel contrastive training scheme with hard negative mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate the benefits of the proposed selection-based approach. For example, when all 671k reactants in the USPTO database are given as candidates, our RetCL achieves top-1 exact match accuracy of 71.3% for the USPTO-50k benchmark, while a recent transformer-based approach achieves 59.6%. We also demonstrate that RetCL generalizes well to unseen templates in various settings in contrast to template-based approaches.",

Recent studies claimed that DNNs first learn simple patterns and then memorize noise; some other works showed a phenomenon that DNNs have a spectral bias to learn target functions from low to high frequencies during training. However, we show that the monotonicity of the learning bias does not always hold: under the experimental setup of deep double descent, the high-frequency components of DNNs diminish in the late stage of training, leading to the second descent of the test error. Besides, we find that the spectrum of DNNs can be applied to indicating the second descent of the test error, even though it is calculated from the training set only.",

        "abstract": "The main challenge of cross-modal retrieval is to learn the consistent embedding for heterogeneous modalities. To solve this problem, traditional label-wise cross-modal approaches usually constrain the inter-modal and intra-modal embedding consistency relying on the label ground-truths. However, the experiments reveal that different modal networks actually have various generalization capacities, thereby end-to-end joint training with consistency loss usually leads to sub-optimal uni-modal model, which in turn affects the learning of consistent embedding. Therefore, in this paper, we argue that what really needed for supervised cross-modal retrieval is a good shared classification model. In other words, we learn the consistent embedding by ensuring the classification performance of each modality on the shared model, without the consistency loss. Specifically, we consider a technique called Semantic Sharing, which directly trains the two modalities interactively by adopting a shared self-attention based classification model. We evaluate the proposed approach on three representative datasets. The results validate that the proposed semantic sharing can consistently boost the performance under NDCG metric.",

        "abstract": "Top-k maximum inner product search (MIPS) is a central task in many machine learning applications. This work extends top-k MIPS with a budgeted setting, that asks for the best approximate top-k MIPS given a limited budget of computational operations. We study recent advanced sampling methods, including wedge and diamond sampling, to solve budgeted top-k MIPS. First, we theoretically show that diamond sampling is essentially a combination of wedge sampling and basic sampling for top-k MIPS. Second, we propose dWedge, a simple deterministic variant of wedge sampling for budgeted top-k MIPS. Empirically, dWedge provides significantly higher accuracy than other budgeted top-k MIPS solvers while maintaining a similar speedup.",

        "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated success in challenging decision-making/control tasks. However, RL methods, which solve tasks through maximizing the expected reward, may generate undesirable behaviors due to inferior local convergence or incompetent reward design. These undesirable behaviors of agents may not reduce the total reward but destroy the user experience of the application. For example, in the autonomous driving task, the policy actuated by speed reward behaves much more sudden brakes while human drivers generally don\u2019t do that. To overcome this problem, we present a novel method named Reward-Constrained Behavior Cloning (RCBC) which synthesizes imitation learning and constrained reinforcement learning. RCBC leverages human demonstrations to induce desirable or human-like behaviors and employs lower-bound reward constraints for policy optimization to maximize the expected reward. Empirical results on popular benchmark environments show that RCBC learns signi\ufb01cantly more human-desired policies with performance guarantees which meet the lower-bound reward constraints while performing better than or as well as baseline methods in terms of reward maximization.",

However, the assumption that collected demonstrations are optimal cannot always hold in real-world tasks, which would seriously influence the performance of the learned agent. In this paper, we propose a robust method within the framework of Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) to address imperfect demonstration issue, in which good demonstrations can be adaptively selected for training while bad demonstrations are abandoned. Specifically, a binary weight is assigned to each expert demonstration to indicate whether to select it for training. The reward function in GAIL is employed to determine this weight (i.e. higher reward results in higher weight). Compared to some existing solutions that require some auxiliary information about this weight, we set up the connection between weight and model so that we can jointly optimize GAIL and learn the latent weight. Besides hard binary weighting, we also propose a soft weighting scheme. Experiments in the Mujoco demonstrate the proposed method outperforms other GAIL-based methods when dealing with imperfect demonstrations.",

Our theoretical analysis highlights the role of inductive bias in aligning distributions across domains. We illustrate it on standard benchmarks by proposing a new learning procedure for UDA. We observed empirically that weak inductive bias makes adaptation robust to label shift. The elaboration of stronger inductive bias is a promising direction for new UDA algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Recent researches have suggested that the predictive accuracy of neural network may contend with its adversarial robustness. This presents challenges in designing effective regularization schemes that also provide strong adversarial robustness. Revisiting Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM) as a unifying regularization principle, we propose Adversarial Labelling of Perturbed Samples (ALPS) as a regularization scheme that aims at improving the generalization ability and adversarial robustness of the trained model. ALPS trains neural networks with synthetic samples formed by perturbing each authentic input sample towards another one along with an adversarially assigned label. The ALPS regularization objective is formulated as a min-max problem, in which the outer problem is minimizing an upper-bound of the VRM loss, and the inner problem is L1-ball constrained adversarial labelling on perturbed sample. The analytic solution to the induced inner maximization problem is elegantly derived, which enables computational efficiency. Experiments on the SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets show that the ALPS has a state-of-the-art regularization performance while also serving as an effective adversarial training scheme.",

Unfortunately, learning reliably composable skills is difficult, because all the components of every skill are constantly changing during learning. We propose three methods for improving the composability of learned skills: representing skill initiation regions using a combination of pessimistic and optimistic classifiers; learning re-targetable policies that are robust to non-stationary subgoal regions; and learning robust option policies using model-based RL. We test these improvements on four sparse-reward maze navigation tasks involving a simulated quadrupedal robot. Each method successively improves the robustness of a baseline skill discovery method, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art flat and hierarchical methods.",

In this paper, we propose an accelerated particle optimization sampling method called Stochastic Hamiltonian Particle Optimization Sampling (SHPOS). Compared to the first-order dynamics used in SPOS, SHPOS adopts an augmented second-order dynamics, which involves an extra momentum term to achieve acceleration. We establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SHPOS, and show that it enjoys a faster convergence rate than SPOS. Besides, we also propose a variance-reduced stochastic gradient variant of SHPOS for tasks with large-scale datasets and complex models. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate our theory and demonstrate the superiority of SHPOS over the state-of-the-art.",

Existing supervised methods in error detection require a significant amount of training data while unsupervised methods rely on fixed inductive biases, which are usually hard to generalize, to solve the problem. In this paper, we present SPADE, a novel semi-supervised probabilistic approach for error detection. SPADE  introduces a novel probabilistic active learning model, where the system suggests examples to be labeled based on the agreements between user labels and indicative signals, which are designed to capture potential errors.  SPADE uses a two-phase data augmentation process to enrich a dataset before training a deep learning classifier to detect unlabeled errors. In our evaluation, SPADE achieves an average F1-score of 0.91 over five datasets and yields a 10% improvement compared with the state-of-the-art systems.",

To quantify the relationship between information flow and audiences' perceived quality, we conduct a case study where subjects watch one of the world\u2019s biggest esports events, LOL S10.  In addition to eliciting information flow, we also ask subjects to report their rating for each game. We find that the amount of surprise in the end of the game plays a dominant role in predicting the rating. This suggests the importance of incorporating when the surprise occurs, in addition to the amount of surprise, in perceived quality models. For content providers, it implies that everything else being equal, it is better for twists to be more likely to happen toward the end of a show rather than uniformly throughout.",

        "abstract": "Weakly supervised learning (WSL) refers to learning from a large amount of weak supervision data. This includes i) incomplete supervision (e.g., semi-supervised learning);  ii) inexact supervision (e.g., multi-instance learning) and iii) inaccurate supervision (e.g., label noise learning). Unlike supervised learning which typically achieves performance improvement with more labeled data, WSL may sometimes even degenerate performance with more weak supervision data. It is thus desired to study safe WSL, which could robustly improve performance with weak supervision data. In this article, we share our understanding of the problem from in-distribution data to out-of-distribution data, and discuss possible ways to alleviate it, from the aspects of worst-case analysis, ensemble-learning, and bi-level optimization. We also share some open problems, to inspire future researches.",

        "abstract": "Medication recommendation is an essential task of AI for healthcare. Existing works focused on recommending drug combinations for patients with complex health conditions solely based on their electronic health records. Thus, they have the following limitations: (1) some important data such as drug molecule structures have not been utilized in the recommendation process. (2) drug-drug interactions (DDI) are modeled implicitly, which can lead to sub-optimal results. To address these limitations, we propose a DDI-controllable drug recommendation model named SafeDrug to leverage drugs\u2019 molecule structures and model DDIs explicitly. SafeDrug is equipped with a global message passing neural network (MPNN) module and a local bipartite learning module to fully encode the connectivity and functionality of drug molecules. SafeDrug also has a controllable loss function to control DDI level in the recommended drug combinations effectively. On a benchmark dataset, our SafeDrug is relatively shown to reduce DDI by 19.43% and improves 2.88% on Jaccard similarity between recommended and actually prescribed drug combinations over previous approaches. Moreover, SafeDrug also requires much fewer parameters than previous deep learning based approaches, leading to faster training by about 14% and around 2\u00d7 speed-up in inference.",

        "abstract": "Sleep staging is fundamental for sleep assessment and disease diagnosis. Although previous attempts to classify sleep stages have achieved high classification performance, several challenges remain open: 1) How to effectively extract salient waves in multimodal sleep data; 2) How to capture the multi-scale transition rules among sleep stages; 3) How to adaptively seize the key role of specific modality for sleep staging. To address these challenges, we propose SalientSleepNet, a multimodal salient wave detection network for sleep staging. Specifically, SalientSleepNet is a temporal fully convolutional network based on the $U^2$-Net architecture that is originally proposed for salient object detection in computer vision. It is mainly composed of two independent $U^2$-like streams to extract the salient features from multimodal data, respectively. Meanwhile, the multi-scale extraction module is designed to capture multi-scale transition rules among sleep stages. Besides, the multimodal attention module is proposed to adaptively capture valuable information from multimodal data for the specific sleep stage. Experiments on the two datasets demonstrate that SalientSleepNet outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. It is worth noting that this model has the least amount of parameters compared with the existing deep neural network models.",

        "abstract": "Continuous DR-submodular maximization is an important machine learning problem, which covers numerous popular applications.  With the emergence of large-scale distributed data, developing efficient algorithms for the continuous DR-submodular maximization, such as the decentralized Frank-Wolfe method, became an important challenge. However, existing decentralized Frank-Wolfe methods for this kind of problem have the sample complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^3)$, incurring a large computational overhead. In this paper, we propose two novel sample efficient decentralized Frank-Wolfe methods to address this challenge. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the sample complexity of the two proposed methods is $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^2)$, which is better than $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^3)$ of the existing methods. As far as we know, this is the first published result achieving such a favorable sample complexity. Extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",

        "abstract": "Recently, novel ILP systems under the answer set semantics have been proposed, some of which are robust to noise and scalable over large hypothesis spaces. One such system is FastLAS, which is significantly faster than other state-of-the-art ASP-based ILP systems. FastLAS is, however, only capable of Observational Predicate Learning (OPL), where the learned hypothesis defines predicates that are directly observed in the examples. It cannot learn knowledge that is indirectly observable, such as learning causes of observed events. This class of problems, known as non-OPL, is known to be difficult to handle in the context of non-monotonic semantics. Solving non-OPL learning tasks whilst preserving scalability is a challenging open problem.\r\n\r\nWe address this problem with a new abductive method for translating examples of a non-OPL task to a set of examples, called possibilities, such that the original example is covered iff at least one of the possibilities is covered. This new method allows an ILP system capable of performing OPL tasks to be \"upgraded\" to solve non-OPL tasks. In particular, we present our new FastNonOPL system, which upgrades FastLAS with the new possibility generation. We compare it to other state-of-the-art ASP-based ILP systems capable of solving non-OPL tasks, showing that FastNonOPL is significantly faster, and in many cases more accurate, than these other systems.",

        "abstract": "The vast majority of community detection algorithms assume that the networks are totally observed. However, in reality many networks cannot be fully observed. On such network is edges-missing network, where some relationships (edges) between two entities are missing. Recently, several works have been proposed to solve this problem by combining link prediction and community detection in a two-stage method or in a unified framework. However, the goal of link prediction, which is to predict as many correct edges as possible, is not consistent with the requirement for predicting the important edges for discovering community structure on edges-missing networks. Thus, combining link prediction and community detection cannot work very well in terms of detecting community structure for edges-missing network. In this paper, we propose a community self-guided generative model which jointly completes the edges-missing network and identifies communities. In our new model, completing missing edges and identifying communities are not isolated but closely intertwined. Furthermore, we developed an effective model inference method that combines a nested Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and Metropolis-Hastings Sampling. Extensive experiments on real-world edges-missing networks show that our model can effectively detect community structures while completing missing edges.",

        "abstract": "Medication recommendation is a significant healthcare application due to its promise in effectively prescribing medications. Avoiding fatal side effects related to Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) is among the critical challenges. Most existing methods try to mitigate the problem by providing models with extra DDI knowledge, making models complicated. While treating all patients with different DDI properties as a single cohort would put forward strict requirements on models' generalization performance. In pursuit of a valuable model for a safe recommendation, we propose the Self-Supervised Adversarial Regularization Model for Medication Recommendation (SARMR). SARMR obtains the target distribution associated with safe medication combinations from raw patient records for adversarial regularization. In this way, the model can shape distributions of patient representations to achieve DDI reduction. To obtain accurate self-supervision information, SARMR models interactions between physicians and patients by building a key-value memory neural network and carrying out multi-hop reading to obtain contextual information for patient representations. SARMR outperforms all baseline methods in the experiment on a real-world clinical dataset. This model can achieve DDI reduction when considering the different number of DDI types, which demonstrates the robustness of adversarial regularization for safe medication recommendation.",

        "abstract": "Weakly-supervised temporal action localization aims to locate intervals of action instances with only video-level action labels for training. However, the localization results generated from video classification networks are often not accurate due to the lack of temporal boundary annotation of actions. Our motivating insight is that the temporal boundary of action should be stably predicted under various temporal transforms. This inspires a self-supervised equivariant transform consistency constraint. We design a set of temporal transform operations, including naive temporal down-sampling to learnable attention-piloted time warping. In our model, a localization network aims to perform well under all transforms, and another policy network is designed to choose a temporal transform at each iteration that adversarially brings localization result inconsistent with the localization network's. Additionally, we devise a self-refine module to enhance the completeness of action intervals harnessing temporal and semantic contexts. Experimental results on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly-supervised temporal action localization methods.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel pretext task for self-supervised video representation learning by exploiting spatiotemporal continuity in videos. It is motivated by the fact that videos are spatiotemporal by nature and a representation learned by detecting spatiotemporal continuity/discontinuity is thus beneficial for downstream video content analysis tasks. A natural choice of such a pretext task is to construct spatiotemporal (3D) jigsaw puzzles and learn to solve them. However, as we demonstrate in the experiments, this task turns out to be intractable. We thus propose Constrained Spatiotemporal Jigsaw (CSJ) whereby the 3D jigsaws are formed in a constrained manner to ensure that large continuous spatiotemporal cuboids exist. This provides sufficient cues for the model to reason about the continuity. Instead of solving them directly, which could still be extremely hard, we carefully design four surrogate tasks that are more solvable. The four tasks aim to learn representations sensitive to spatiotemporal continuity at both the local and global levels. Extensive experiments show that our CSJ achieves state-of-the-art on various benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is a simple but effective method for model compression, which obtains a better-performing small network (Student) by learning from a well-trained large network (Teacher). However, when the difference in the model sizes of Student and Teacher is large, the gap in capacity leads to poor performance of Student. Existing methods focus on seeking simplified or more effective knowledge from Teacher to narrow the Teacher-Student gap, while we address this problem by Student's self-boosting. Specifically, we propose a novel distillation method named Self-boosting Feature Distillation (SFD), which eases the Teacher-Student gap by feature integration and self-distillation of Student. Three different modules are designed for feature integration to enhance the discriminability of Student's feature, which leads to improving the order of convergence in theory. Moreover, an easy-to-operate self-distillation strategy is put forward to stabilize the training process and promote the performance of Student, without additional forward propagation or memory consumption. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and networks show that our method is significantly superior to existing methods.",

It could be very challenging when there is no intersection between the alreadyknown classes (base set) and the novel set (new classes). To alleviate this problem, we propose to evolve the network (for the base set) via label propagation and self-supervision to shrink the distribution difference between the base set and the novel set. Our network evolution approach transfers the latent distribution from the already-known classes to the unknown (novel) classes by: (a) label propagation of the novel/new classes (novel set); and (b) design of dual-task to exploit a discriminative representation to effectively diminish the overfitting on the base set and enhance the generalization ability on the novel set. We conduct comprehensive experiments to examine our network evolution approach against numerous state-of-the-art ones, especially in a higher way setup and cross-dataset scenarios. Notably, our approach outperforms the second best state-of-the-art method by a large margin of 3.25% for one-shot evaluation over miniImageNet.",

We can exploit background knowledge about common spatial relations between landmark objects and target objects to narrow down search space. In this paper, we propose an active visual object search strategy method through our introduction of the Semantic Linking Maps (SLiM) model. SLiM simultaneously maintains the belief over a target object's location as well as landmark objects' locations, while accounting for probabilistic inter-object spatial relations. Based on SLiM, we describe a hybrid search strategy that selects the next best view pose for searching for the target object based on the maintained belief. We demonstrate the efficiency of our SLiM-based search strategy through comparative experiments in simulated environments. We further demonstrate the real-world applicability of SLiM-based search in scenarios with a Fetch mobile manipulation robot.",

We propose Sensitivity Direction Learning (SDL) for learning about the neural network model with user-specified relationships (e.g., monotonicity, convexity) between each input feature and the output of the model by imposing soft shape constraints which represent domain knowledge. To impose soft shape constraints, SDL uses a novel penalty function, Sensitivity Direction Error (SDE) function, which returns the squared error between coefficients of the approximation curve for each Individual Conditional Expectation plot and coefficient constraints which represent domain knowledge. The effectiveness of our concept was verified by simple experiments. Similar to those such as L2 regularization and dropout, SDL and SDE can be used without changing neural network architecture. We believe our algorithm can be a strong candidate for neural network users who want to incorporate domain knowledge.",

In this paper, we present a new perspective on the 3D human pose estimation method from point cloud sequences. To sample effective point clouds from input, we design a differentiable point cloud sampling method built on density-guided attention mechanism. To avoid the jitter caused by previous 3D human pose estimation problems, we adopt temporal information to obtain more stable results.

This strategy may miss the right result due to the accuracy misalignment between classification and regression. In this paper, we propose a novel siamese tracking algorithm called SiamRCR, addressing this problem with a simple, light and effective solution. It builds reciprocal links between classification and regression branches, which can dynamically re-weight their losses for each positive sample. In addition, we add a localization branch to predict the localization accuracy, so that it can work as the replacement of the regression assistance link during inference. This branch makes the training and inference more consistent. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SiamRCR and its superiority over the state-of-the-art competitors on GOT-10k, LaSOT, TrackingNet, OTB-2015, VOT-2018 and VOT-2019. Moreover, our SiamRCR runs at 65 FPS, far above the real-time requirement.",

        "abstract": "We apply generative adversarial network (GAN) technology to build an event generator that simulates particle production in electron-proton scattering that is free of theoretical assumptions about underlying particle dynamics. The difficulty of efficiently training a GAN event simulator lies in learning the complicated patterns of the distributions of the particles physical properties. We develop a GAN that selects a set of transformed features from particle momenta that can be generated easily by the generator, and uses these to produce a set of augmented features that improve the sensitivity of the discriminator. The new Feature-Augmented and Transformed GAN (FAT-GAN) is able to faithfully reproduce the distribution of final state electron momenta in inclusive electron scattering, without the need for input derived from domain-based theoretical assumptions. The developed technology can play a significant role in boosting the science of existing and future accelerator facilities, such as the Electron-Ion Collider.",

We provide a new characterisation of skeptical acceptance wrt. preferred semantics that does not involve the notion of a preferred extension. We then develop a new algorithm that also relies on iterative calls to an external SAT-solver but avoids the costly part of maximising admissible sets. We present the results of an experimental evaluation that shows that this new approach significantly outperforms the state of the art.

        "abstract": "Smart contracts hold digital coins worth billions of dollars, their security issues have drawn extensive attention in the past years. Towards smart contract vulnerability detection, conventional methods heavily rely on fixed expert rules, leading to low accuracy and poor scalability. Recent deep learning approaches alleviate this issue but fail to encode useful expert knowledge. In this paper, we explore combining deep learning with expert patterns in an explainable fashion. Specifically, we develop automatic tools to extract expert patterns from the source code. We then cast the code into a semantic graph to extract deep graph features. Thereafter, the global graph feature and local expert patterns are fused to cooperate and approach the final prediction, while yielding their interpretable weights. Experiments are conducted on all available smart contracts with source code in two platforms, Ethereum and VNT Chain. Empirically, our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our code is released.",

Previous works on memory mechanisms show benefits of using episodic-based data structures for discrete action problems in terms of sample-efficiency. The application of episodic memory for continuous control with a large action space is not trivial. Our study aims to answer the question: can episodic memory be used to improve agent's performance in continuous control? Our proposed algorithm combines episodic memory with Actor-Critic architecture by modifying critic's objective. We further improve performance by introducing episodic-based replay buffer prioritization.

The problem of deploying security resources to protect against an attacker in networked domains can be modeled as Network Security Games (NSGs). Unfortunately, existing approaches, including the deep learning-based approaches, are inefficient to solve large-scale extensive-form NSGs. In this paper, we propose a novel learning paradigm, NSG-NFSP, to solve large-scale extensive-form NSGs based on Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP). Our main contributions include: i) reforming the best response (BR) policy network in NFSP to be a mapping from action-state pair to action-value, to make the calculation of BR possible in NSGs; ii) converting the average policy network of an NFSP agent into a metric-based classifier, helping the agent to assign distributions only on legal actions rather than all actions; iii) enabling NFSP with high-level actions, which can benefit training efficiency and stability in NSGs; and iv) leveraging information contained in graphs of NSGs by learning efficient graph node embeddings. Our algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in both scalability and solution quality.",

        "abstract": "Math word problems (MWPs) have been recently addressed with Seq2Seq models by `translating' math problems described in natural language to a mathematical expression, following a typical encoder-decoder structure. Although effective in solving classical math problems, these models fail when a subtle variation is applied to the word expression of a math problem, and leads to a remarkably different answer. We find the failure is because MWPs with different answers but similar math formula expression are encoded closely in the latent space. We thus designed a teacher module to make the MWP encoding vector match the correct solution and disaccord from the wrong solutions, which are manipulated from the correct solution. Experimental results on two benchmark MWPs datasets verified that our proposed solution outperforms the state-of-the-art models.",

        "abstract": "We study a practical domain adaptation task, called source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) problem, in which we cannot access source domain data due to data privacy issues but only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data are available.  This task, however, is very difficult due to one key challenge: the lack of source data and target domain labels makes model adaptation very challenging. To address this, we propose to mine the hidden knowledge in the source model and exploit it to generate source avatar prototypes (i.e. representative features for each source class) as well as target pseudo labels for domain alignment. To this end, we propose a Contrastive Prototype Generation and Adaptation (CPGA) method. Specifically, CPGA consists of two stages: (1) prototype generation: by exploring the classification boundary information of the source model, we train a prototype generator to generate avatar prototypes via contrastive learning. (2) prototype adaptation: based on the generated source prototypes and target pseudo labels, we develop a new robust contrastive prototype adaptation strategy to align each pseudo-labeled target data to the corresponding source prototypes. Extensive experiments on three UDA benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Crime prediction is crucial for public safety and resource optimization, yet is very challenging due to two aspects: i) the dynamics of criminal patterns across time and space, crime events are distributed unevenly on both spatial and temporal domains; ii) time-evolving dependencies between different types of crimes (e.g., Theft, Robbery, Assault, Damage) which reveal fine-grained semantics of crimes. To tackle these challenges, we propose Spatial-Temporal Sequential Hypergraph Network (ST-SHN) to collectively encode complex crime spatial-temporal patterns as well as the underlying category-wise crime semantic relationships. In specific, to handle spatial-temporal dynamics under the long-range and global context, we design a graph-structured message passing architecture with the integration of the hypergraph learning paradigm. To capture category-wise crime heterogeneous relations in a dynamic environment, we introduce a multi-channel routing mechanism to learn the time-evolving structural dependency across crime types. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-word datasets, showing that our proposed ST-SHN framework can significantly improve the prediction performance as compared to various state-of-the-art baselines.

We specifically focus on acquired voice disorders where users continue to be able to make facial and lip gestures associated with speech. Despite the rich literature on assistive technologies in this space, there remains a gap for a solution that neither requires external infrastructure in the environment, battery-powered sensors on skin or body-worn manual input devices. We present RFTattoo, which to our knowledge is the first wireless speech recognition system for voice impairments using batteryless and flexible RFID tattoos. We design specialized wafer-thin tattoos attached around the user's face and easily hidden by makeup. We build models that process signal variations from these tattoos to a portable RFID reader to recognize various facial gestures corresponding to distinct classes of sounds. We then develop natural language processing models that infer meaningful words and sentences based on the observed series of gestures. A detailed user study with 10 users reveals 86% accuracy in reconstructing the top-100 words in the English language, even without the users making any sounds.",

        "abstract": "What can we picture solely from a clip of speech? Previous research has shown the possibility of directly inferring the appearance of a person's face by listening to a voice. However, within human speech lies not only the biometric identity signal but also the identity-irrelevant information such as the talking content. Our goal is to extract as much information from a clip of speech as possible. In particular, we aim at not only inferring the face of a person but also animating it. Our key insight is to synchronize audio and visual representations from two perspectives in a style-based generative framework. Specifically, contrastive learning is leveraged to map both the identity and speech content information within the speech to visual representation spaces. Furthermore, the identity space is strengthened with class centroids. Through curriculum learning, the style-based generator is capable of automatically balancing the information from the two latent spaces. Extensive experiments show that our approach encourages better speech-identity correlation learning while generating vivid faces whose identities are consistent with given speech samples. Moreover, by leveraging the same model, these inferred faces can be driven to talk by the audio.",

In this paper, we initialize the generalization analysis of RCD by leveraging the powerful tool of algorithmic stability. We establish argument stability bounds of RCD for both convex and strongly convex objectives, from which we develop optimal generalization bounds by showing how to early-stop the algorithm to tradeoff the estimation and optimization. Our analysis shows that RCD enjoys better stability as compared to stochastic gradient descent.",

Its optimal solution is intractable due to exponentially large state and action spaces with respect to the number of arms. Existing approximation approaches, e.g., Whittle's index policy, have difficulty in capturing either temporal or spatial factors such as impacts from other arms. We propose considering both factors using the attention mechanism, which has achieved great success in deep learning. Our state-aware value function approximation solution comprises an attention-based value function approximator and a Bellman equation solver. The attention-based coordination module capture both spatial and temporal factors for arm coordination. The Bellman equation solver utilizes the decoupling structure of RMABs to acquire solutions with significantly reduced computation overheads. In particular, the time complexity of our approximation is linear in the number of arms. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness and investigate the properties of our proposed method with numerical experiments.",

As with recurrent SPNs, S-RSPMNs utilize a repeatable template network to model sequences of arbitrary lengths. We present an algorithm for learning compact template structures by identifying unique belief states and the transitions between them through a state matching process that utilizes augmented data.  In our knowledge, this is the first data-driven approach that learns graphical models for planning under partial observability, which can be solved efficiently. S-RSPMNs retain the linear solution complexity of SPMNs, and we demonstrate significant improvements in compactness of representation and the run time of structure learning and inference in sequential domains.",

        "abstract": "Image-text matching plays a central role in bridging the semantic gap between vision and language. The key point to achieve precise visual-semantic alignment lies in capturing the fine-grained cross-modal correspondence between image and text. Most previous methods rely on single-step reasoning to discover the visual-semantic interactions, which lacks the ability of exploiting the multi-level information to locate the hierarchical fine-grained relevance. Different from them, in this work, we propose a step-wise hierarchical alignment network (SHAN) that decomposes image-text matching into multi-step cross-modal reasoning process. Specifically, we first achieve local-to-local alignment at fragment level, following by performing global-to-local and global-to-global alignment at context level sequentially. This progressive alignment strategy supplies our model with more complementary and sufficient semantic clues to understand the hierarchical correlations between image and text. The experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.",

In this paper, we draw inspiration from the recent success of the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework designed for challenging continuous control problems to develop stochastic policies over high dimensional continuous spaces including image representation, generation, and control simultaneously. Central to this method is the Stochastic Actor-Executor-Critic (SAEC) which is an off-policy actor-critic model with an additional executor to generate realistic images. Specifically, the actor focuses on the high-level representation and control policy by a stochastic latent action, as well as explicitly directs the executor to generate low-level actions to manipulate the state. Experiments on several image-to-image translation tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed SAEC when facing high-dimensional continuous space problems.",

        "abstract": "Some of the most relevant future applications of multi-agent systems like autonomous driving or factories as a service display mixed-motive scenarios, where agents might have conflicting goals. In these settings agents are likely to learn undesirable outcomes in terms of cooperation under independent learning, such as overly greedy behavior. Motivated from real world societies, in this work we propose to utilize market forces to provide incentives for agents to become cooperative. As demonstrated in an iterated version of the Prisoner's Dilemma, the proposed market formulation can change the dynamics of the game to consistently learn cooperative policies. Further we evaluate our approach in spatially and temporally extended settings for varying numbers of agents. We empirically find that the presence of markets can improve both the overall result and agent individual returns via their trading activities.",

We study a testing model, where the first test reveals if the realized value is smaller or larger than the median of the underlying distribution. Subsequent tests allow to further  narrow down the interval in which the realization is located. There is a limited number of possible tests, and our goal is to design near-optimal testing strategies that allow to maximize the expected value of the chosen item.

        "abstract": "Stochastic shortest path (SSP) is a well-known problem in planning and control, in which an agent has to reach a goal state in minimum total expected cost. In this paper we present the adversarial SSP model that also accounts for adversarial changes in the costs over time, while the underlying transition function remains unchanged. Formally, an agent interacts with an SSP environment for K episodes, the cost function changes arbitrarily between episodes, and the transitions are unknown to the agent. We develop the first algorithms for adversarial SSPs and prove high probability regret bounds of square-root K assuming all costs are strictly positive, and sub-linear regret in the general case. We are the first to consider this natural setting of adversarial SSP and obtain sub-linear regret for it.",

        "abstract": "When aggregating preferences of multiple agents, strategyproofness is a fundamental requirement. For randomized voting rules, so-called social decision schemes (SDSs), strategyproofness is usually formalized with the help of utility functions. A classic result shown by Gibbard in 1977 characterizes the set of SDSs that are strategyproof with respect to all utility functions and shows that these SDSs are either indecisive or unfair. For finding more insights into the trade-off between strategyproofness and decisiveness, we propose the notion of U-strategyproofness which requires that only voters with a utility function in the set U cannot manipulate. In particular, we show that if the utility functions in U value the best alternative much more than other alternatives, there are U-strategyproof SDSs that choose an alternative with probability 1 whenever all but k voters rank it first. We also prove for rank-based SDSs that this large gap in the utilities is required to be strategyproof and that the gap must increase in k. On the negative side, we show that U-strategyproofness is incompatible with Condorcet-consistency if U satisfies minimal symmetry conditions and there are at least four alternatives. For three alternatives, the Condorcet rule can be characterized based on U-strategyproofness for the set U containing all equi-distant utility functions.",

        "abstract": "Recently, lane detection has made great progress with the rapid development of deep neural networks and autonomous driving. However, there exist three mainly problems including characterizing lanes, modeling the structural relationship between scenes and lanes, and supporting more attributes (e.g., instance and type) of lanes. In this paper, we propose a novel structure guided framework to solve these problems simultaneously. In the framework, we first introduce a new lane representation to characterize each instance. Then a top-down vanishing point guided anchoring mechanism is proposed to produce intensive anchors, which efficiently capture various lanes. Next, multi-level structural constraints are used to improve the perception of lanes. In the process, pixel-level perception with binary segmentation is introduced to promote features around anchors and restore lane details from bottom up, a lane-level relation is put forward to model structures (i.e., parallel) around lanes, and an image-level attention is used to adaptively attend different regions of the image from the perspective of scenes. With the help of structural guidance, anchors are effectively classified and regressed to obtain precise locations and shapes. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 117 FPS on a single GPU.",

A clever recent approach, \\emph{surprisingly popular voting}, elicits additional information from the individuals, namely their \\emph{prediction} of other individuals' votes, and provably recovers the ground truth even when experts are in minority. This approach works well when the goal is to pick the correct option from a small list, but when the goal is to recover a true ranking of the alternatives, a direct application of the approach requires eliciting too much information. We explore practical techniques for extending the surprisingly popular algorithm to ranked voting by partial votes and predictions and designing robust aggregation rules.

In this paper, we present a novel SDP solution method for MDPs with LP transitions and continuous piecewise linear dynamics by introducing a novel, fully symbolic argmax operator. On three diverse domains, we show the first automated exact closed-form SDP solution to these challenging problems and the significant advantages of our SDP approach over discretized approximations.",

We consider the problem of learning commonsense knowledge of when a tool may be useful and how its use may be composed with other tools to accomplish a high-level task instructed by a human. We introduce TANGO, a novel neural model for predicting task-specific tool interactions. TANGO is trained using demonstrations obtained from human teachers instructing a virtual robot in a physics simulator. TANGO encodes the world state consisting of objects and symbolic relationships between them using a graph neural network. The model learns to attend over the scene using knowledge of the goal and the action history, finally decoding the symbolic action to execute. Crucially, we address generalization to unseen environments where some known tools are missing, but alternative unseen tools are present. We show that by augmenting the representation of the environment with pre-trained embeddings derived from a knowledge-base, the model can generalize effectively to novel environments. Experimental results show a 60.5-78.9% improvement over the baseline in predicting successful symbolic plans in unseen settings for a simulated mobile manipulator.",

        "abstract": "Network representation learning aims at transferring node proximity in networks into distributed vectors, which can be leveraged in various downstream applications. Recent research has shown that nodes in a network can often be organized in latent hierarchical structures, but without a particular underlying taxonomy, the learned node embedding is less useful nor interpretable. In this work, we aim to improve network embedding by modeling the conditional node proximity in networks indicated by node labels residing in real taxonomies. In the meantime, we also aim to model the hierarchical label proximity in the given taxonomies, which is too coarse by solely looking at the hierarchical topologies. Comprehensive experiments and case studies demonstrate the utility of TAXOGAN.",

        "abstract": "Existing research for image captioning usually represents an image using a scene graph with low-level facts (objects and relations) and fails to capture the high-level semantics. In this paper, we propose a Theme Concepts extended Image Captioning (TCIC) framework that incorporates theme concepts to represent high-level cross-modality semantics. In practice, we model theme concepts as memory vectors and propose Transformer with Theme Nodes (TTN) to incorporate those vectors for image captioning. Considering that theme concepts can be learned from both images and captions, we propose two settings for their representations learning based on TTN. On the vision side, TTN is configured to take both scene graph based features and theme concepts as input for visual representation learning. On the language side, TTN is configured to take both captions and theme concepts as input for text representation re-construction. Both settings aim to generate target captions with the same transformer-based decoder. During the training, we further align representations of theme concepts learned from images and corresponding captions to enforce the cross-modality learning. Experimental results on MS COCO show the effectiveness of our approach compared to some state-of-the-art models.",

        "abstract": "Prediction based on Irregularly Sampled Time Series (ISTS) is of wide concern in real-world applications. For more accurate prediction, methods had better grasp more data characteristics. Different from ordinary time series, ISTS is characterized by irregular time intervals of intra-series and different sampling rates of inter-series. However, existing methods have suboptimal predictions due to artificially introducing new dependencies in a time series and biasedly learning relations among time series when modeling these two characteristics. In this work, we propose a novel Time Encoding (TE) mechanism. TE can embed the time information as time vectors in the complex domain. It has the properties of absolute distance and relative distance under different sampling rates, which helps to represent two irregularities. Meanwhile, we create a new model named Time Encoding Echo State Network (TE-ESN). It is the first ESNs-based model that can process ISTS data. Besides, TE-ESN incorporates long short-term memories and series fusion to grasp horizontal and vertical relations. Experiments on one chaos system and three real-world datasets show that TE-ESN performs better than all baselines and has better reservoir property.",

        "abstract": "Using the principle of imitation learning and the theory of optimal transport we propose in this paper a novel model for unsupervised domain adaptation named Teacher Imitation Domain Adaptation with Optimal Transport (TIDOT). Our model includes two cooperative agents: a teacher and a student. The former agent is trained to be an expert on labeled data in the source domain, whilst the latter one aims to work with unlabeled data in the target domain. More specifically, optimal transport is applied to quantify the total of the distance between embedded distributions of the source and target data in the joint space, and the distance between predictive distributions of both agents, thus by minimizing this quantity TIDOT could mitigate not only the data shift but also the label shift. Comprehensive empirical studies show that TIDOT outperforms existing state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.",

        "abstract": "Visual information extraction (VIE) has attracted increasing attention in recent years. The existing methods usually first organized optical character recognition (OCR) results in plain texts and then utilized token-level category annotations as supervision to train a sequence tagging model. However, it expends great annotation costs and may be exposed to label confusion, the OCR errors will also significantly affect the final performance. In this paper, we propose a unified weakly-supervised learning framework called TCPNet (Tag, Copy or Predict Network), which introduces 1) an efficient encoder to simultaneously model the semantic and layout information in 2D OCR results, 2) a weakly-supervised training method that utilizes only sequence-level supervision; and 3) a flexible and switchable decoder which contains two inference modes: one (Copy or Predict Mode) is to output key information sequences of different categories by copying a token from the input or predicting one in each time step, and the other (Tag Mode) is to directly tag the input sequence in a single forward pass. Our method shows new state-of-the-art performance on several public benchmarks, which fully proves its effectiveness.",

Thus, they enable highly flexible enactments in which the agents proceed asynchronously and messages may be arbitrarily reordered. However, the existing semantics for such languages can produce a large number of protocol enactments, which makes verification of a protocol property intractable.\r\n\r\nThis paper formulates a protocol semantics declaratively via inference rules that determine when a message emission or reception becomes enabled during an enactment, and its effect on the local state of an agent.\r\nThe semantics enables heuristics for determining when alternative extensions of a current enactment would be equivalent, thereby helping produce parsimonious models and yielding improved protocol verification methods.",

However, most of the previous works focus more on static heterogeneous networks or learning node embedding within specific snapshots, and seldom attention has been paid to the whole evolution process and capturing all temporal dynamics. In order to fill the gap of obtaining multi-type node embeddings by considering all temporal dynamics during the evolution, we propose a novel temporal HIN embedding method (THINE). THINE not only uses attention mechanism and meta-path to preserve structures and semantics in HIN but also combines the Hawkes process to simulate the evolution of the temporal network. Our extensive evaluations with various real-world temporal HINs demonstrate that THINE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both static and dynamic tasks, including node classification, link prediction, and temporal link recommendation.",

To satisfy this requirement, existing efforts focus on equilibrium refinement, but the scalability and applicability of existing techniques are limited. In this paper, we propose Temporal-Induced Self-Play (TISP), a novel reinforcement learning-based framework to find strategies with decent performances from any decision point onward. TISP uses belief-space representation, backward induction, policy learning, and non-parametric approximation. Building upon TISP, we design a policy-gradient-based algorithm TISP-PG. We prove that TISP-based algorithms can find approximate Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium in zero-sum one-sided stochastic Bayesian games with finite horizon. We test TISP-based algorithms in various games, including finitely repeated security games and a grid-world game. The results show that TISP-PG is more scalable than existing mathematical programming-based methods and significantly outperforms other learning-based methods.",

However, when it comes to Natural Language Processing (NLP), symbols have to be mapped to words and phrases, which are not only ambiguous but also language-specific: multilinguality is indeed a desirable property for NLP systems, and one which enables the generalization of tasks where multiple languages need to be dealt with, without translating text. In this paper we survey BabelNet, a popular wide-coverage lexical-semantic knowledge resource obtained by merging heterogeneous sources into a unified semantic network that helps to scale tasks and applications to hundreds of languages. Over its ten years of existence, thanks to its promise to interconnect languages and resources in structured form, BabelNet has been employed in countless ways and directions. We first introduce the BabelNet model, its components and statistics, and then overview its successful use in a wide range of tasks in NLP as well as in other fields of AI.",

        "abstract": "Most existing text-based person search methods highly depend on exploring the corresponding relations between the regions of the image and the words in the sentence. However, these methods correlated image regions and words in the same semantic granularity. It 1) results in irrelevant corresponding relations between image and text, 2) causes an ambiguity embedding problem.  In this study, we propose a novel multi-granularity embedding learning model for text-based person search. It generates multi-granularity embeddings of partial person bodies in a coarse-to-fine manner by revisiting the person image at different spatial scales. Specifically, we distill the partial knowledge from image scrips to guide the model to select the semantically relevant words from the text description. It can learn discriminative and modality-invariant visual-textual embeddings. In addition, we integrate the partial embeddings at each granularity and perform multi-granularity image-text matching. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, which can achieve new state-of-the-art performance by the learned discriminative partial embeddings.",

        "abstract": "Compared with traditional sequential learning models, graph-based neural networks exhibit excellent properties when encoding text, such as the capacity of capturing global and local information simultaneously. Especially in the semi-supervised scenario, propagating information along the edge can effectively alleviate the sparsity of labeled data. In this paper, beyond the existing architecture of heterogeneous word-document graphs, for the first time, we investigate how to construct lightweight non-heterogeneous graphs based on different linguistic information to better serve free text representation learning. Then, a novel semi-supervised framework for text classification that refines graph topology under theoretical guidance and shares information across different text graphs, namely Text-oriented Graph-based Transductive Learning (TextGTL), is proposed. TextGTL also performs attribute space interpolation based on dense substructure in graphs to predict low-entropy labels with high-quality feature nodes for data augmentation. To verify the effectiveness of TextGTL, we conduct extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets, observing significant performance gains over conventional heterogeneous graphs.  In addition, we also design ablation studies to dive deep into the validity of components in TextTGL.",

While both heuristics and pruning techniques have gained much attention recently, search-boosting techniques in general, and preferred operators in particular have received less attention in the last decade.  \r\nOur work aims at bringing the light back to preferred operators research, with the introduction of preferred operators pruning technique, based on the concept of novelty. Continuing the research on novelty with respect to an underlying heuristic, we present the definition of preferred operators for such novelty heuristics. For that, we extend the previously defined concepts to operators, allowing us to reason about the novelty of the preferred operators.\r\n\r\nOur experimental evaluation shows the practical benefit of our suggested\r\napproach, compared to the currently used methods.",

We expand on previous results by providing a comprehensive complexity-theoretic understanding of CFD based on several new algorithms and lower bounds while taking into account several well-established notions of fairness: proportionality, envy-freeness, EF1 and EFX. In particular, we show that to achieve tractability, one needs to restrict both the agents and the item graph in a meaningful way. We design (XP)-algorithms for the problem parameterized by (1) clique-width of G plus the number of agents and (2) treewidth of G plus the number of agent types, along with corresponding lower bounds. Finally, we show that to achieve fixed-parameter tractability, one needs to not only use a more restrictive parameterization of G, but also include the maximum item valuation as an additional parameter.",

However, standard GNNs are limited in their expressive power, as they cannot distinguish graphs beyond the capability of the Weisfeiler-Leman graph isomorphism heuristic. In order to break this expressiveness barrier, GNNs have been enhanced with random node initialization (RNI), where the idea is to train and run the models with randomized initial node features. In this work, we analyze the expressive power of GNNs with RNI, and prove that these models are universal, a first such result for GNNs not relying on computationally demanding higher-order properties. This universality result holds even with partially randomized initial node features, and preserves the invariance properties of GNNs in expectation. We then empirically analyze the effect of RNI on GNNs, based on carefully constructed datasets. Our empirical findings support the superior performance of GNNs with RNI over standard GNNs.",

        "abstract": "It has become increasingly thorny for computer vision competitions to preserve fairness when participants intentionally fine-tune their models against the test datasets to improve their performance. To mitigate such unfairness, competition organizers restrict the training and evaluation process of participants' models. However, such restrictions introduce massive computation overheads for organizers and potential intellectual property leakage for participants. Thus, we propose Themis, a framework that trains a noise generator jointly with organizers and participants to prevent intentional fine-tuning by protecting test datasets from surreptitious manual labeling. Specifically, with the carefully designed noise generator, Themis adds noise to perturb test sets without twisting the performance ranking of participants' models. We evaluate the validity of Themis with a wide spectrum of real-world models and datasets. Our experimental results show that Themis effectively enforces competition fairness by precluding manual labeling of test sets and preserving the performance ranking of participants' models.",

        "abstract": "We propose algorithms based on a multi-level Thompson sampling scheme, for the stochastic multi-armed bandit and its contextual variant with linear expected rewards, in the setting where arms are clustered. We show, both theoretically and empirically, how exploiting a given cluster structure can significantly improve the regret and computational cost compared to using standard Thompson sampling. In the case of the stochastic multi-armed bandit we give upper bounds on the expected cumulative regret showing how it depends on the quality of the clustering.  Finally, we perform an empirical evaluation showing that our algorithms perform well compared to previously proposed algorithms for bandits with clustered arms.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning performs remarkably well on many time series analysis tasks recently. The superior performance of deep neural networks relies heavily on a large number of training data to avoid overfitting. However, the labeled data of many real-world time series applications may be limited such as classification in medical time series and anomaly detection in AIOps. As an effective way to enhance the size and quality of the training data, data augmentation is crucial to the successful application of deep learning models on time series data. In this paper, we systematically review different data augmentation methods for time series. We propose a taxonomy for the reviewed methods, and then provide a structured review for these methods by highlighting their strengths and limitations. We also empirically compare different data augmentation methods for different tasks including time series classification, anomaly detection, and forecasting. Finally, we discuss and highlight five future directions to provide useful research guidance.",

        "abstract": "Multi-scale information is crucial for modeling time series. Although most existing methods consider multiple scales in the time-series data, they assume all kinds of scales are equally important for each sample, making them unable to capture the dynamic temporal patterns of time series. To this end, we propose Time-Aware Multi-Scale Recurrent Neural Networks (TAMS-RNNs), which disentangle representations of different scales and adaptively select the most important scale for each sample at each time step. First, the hidden state of the RNN is disentangled into multiple independently updated small hidden states, which use different update frequencies to model time-series multi-scale information. Then, at each time step, the temporal context information is used to modulate the features of different scales, selecting the most important time-series scale. Therefore, the proposed model can capture the multi-scale information for each time series at each time step adaptively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multivariate time series classification and human motion prediction tasks. Furthermore, visualized analysis on music genre recognition verifies the effectiveness of the model.",

        "abstract": "Learning decent representations from unlabeled time-series data with temporal dynamics is a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised Time-Series representation learning framework via Temporal and Contextual Contrasting (TS-TCC), to learn time-series representation from unlabeled data. First, the raw time-series data are transformed into two different yet correlated views by using weak and strong augmentations. Second, we propose a novel temporal contrasting module to learn robust temporal representations by designing a tough cross-view prediction task. Last, to further learn discriminative representations, we propose a contextual contrasting module built upon the contexts from the temporal contrasting module. It attempts to maximize the similarity among different contexts of the same sample while minimizing similarity among contexts of different samples. Experiments have been carried out on three real-world time-series datasets. The results manifest that training a linear classifier on top of the features learned by our proposed TS-TCC performs comparably with the supervised training. Additionally, our proposed TS-TCC shows high efficiency in few-labeled data and transfer learning scenarios. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/emadeldeen24/TS-TCC.",

To overcome this gap, we propose parametric transcription, which transcribes an end-to-end style transfer effect into parameter values of specific transformations available in an existing content editing tool. With this approach, users can imitate the style of a reference sample in the tool that they are familiar with and thus can easily continue further exploration by manipulating the parameters. To enable this, we introduce a framework that utilizes an existing pretrained model for style transfer to calculate a perceptual style distance to the reference sample and uses black-box optimization to find the parameters that minimize this distance. Our experiments with various third-party tools, such as Instagram and Blender, show that our framework can effectively leverage deep learning techniques for computational design support.",

        "abstract": "Although neural networks are capable of reaching astonishing performance on a wide variety of contexts, properly training networks on complicated tasks requires expertise and can be expensive from a computational perspective. In industrial applications, data coming from an open-world setting might widely differ from the benchmark datasets on which a network was trained. Being able to monitor the presence of such variations without retraining the network is of crucial importance. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we develop a method to monitor trained neural networks based on the topological properties of their activation graphs. To each new observation, we assign a Topological Uncertainty, a score that aims to assess the reliability of the predictions by investigating the whole network instead of its final layer only as typically done by practitioners. Our approach entirely works at a post-training level and does not require any assumption on the network architecture, optimization scheme, nor the use of data augmentation or auxiliary datasets; and can be faithfully applied on a large range of network architectures and data types. We showcase experimentally the potential of Topological Uncertainty in the context of trained network selection, Out-Of-Distribution detection, and shift-detection, both on synthetic and real datasets of images and graphs.",

Then, we propose a novel contrastive loss to improve the quality of SR images and PSNR/SSIM via explicit knowledge transfer.

        "abstract": "Several images are taken for the same scene with many view directions. Given a pixel in any one image of them, its correspondences may appear in the other images. However, by using existing semantic segmentation methods, we find that the pixel and its correspondences do not always have the same inferred label as expected. Fortunately, from the knowledge of multiple view geometry, if we keep the position of a camera unchanged, and only vary its orientation, there is a homography transformation to describe the relationship of corresponding pixels in such images. Based on this fact, we propose to generate images which are the same as real images of the scene taken in certain novel view directions for training and evaluation. We also introduce gradient guided deformable convolution to alleviate the inconsistency, by learning dynamic proper receptive field from feature gradients. Furthermore, a novel consistency loss is presented to enforce feature consistency. Compared with previous approaches, the proposed method gets significant improvement in both cross-view consistency and semantic segmentation performance on images with abundant view directions, while keeping comparable or better performance on the existing datasets.",

However, to achieve high accuracy, state-of-the-art methods tend to have a large model size and complex post-processing algorithm, which costs intense computation and long end-to-end latency. To solve this problem, we propose an architecture optimization and weight pruning framework to accelerate inference of multi-person pose estimation on mobile devices.

        "abstract": "Code summarization aims to summarize code functionality as high-level nature language descriptions to assist in code comprehension.  Recent approaches in this field mainly focus on generating summaries for code with precise identifier names, in which meaningful words can be found indicating code functionality. When faced with lexically confusing code, current approaches are likely to fail since the correlation between code lexical tokens and summaries is scarce. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel summarization framework named VECOS. VECOS introduces an erosion mechanism to conquer the model's reliance on precisely defined lexical information. To facilitate learning the eroded code's functionality, we force the representation of the eroded code to align with the representation of its original counterpart via variational inference. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches to generate coherent and reliable summaries for various lexically confusing code.",

Our work follows from the classical learning-from-experts scheme, assuming a finite set of classifiers (human experts, rules, options, etc) that cannot be modified. We run separate instances of the algorithm for each label class as well as sensitive groups, where the probability of choosing each instance is optimized for both fairness and regret. Our theoretical results show that approximately equalized odds can be achieved without sacrificing much regret.

        "abstract": "Dynamic Network Embedding (DNE) has recently drawn much attention due to the dynamic nature of many real-world networks. Comparing to a static network, a dynamic network has a unique character called the degree of changes, which can be defined as the average number of the changed edges between consecutive snapshots spanning a dynamic network. The degree of changes could be quite different even for the dynamic networks generated from the same dataset. It is natural to ask whether existing DNE methods are effective and robust w.r.t. the degree of changes. Towards robust DNE, we suggest two important scenarios. One is to investigate the robustness w.r.t. different slicing settings that are used to generate different dynamic networks with different degree of changes, while another focuses more on the robustness w.r.t. different number of changed edges over timesteps.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Model reuse tries to adapt well pre-trained models to a new target task, without access of raw data. It attracts much attention since it reduces the learning resources. Previous model reuse studies typically operate in a single-domain scenario, i.e., the target samples arise from one single domain. However, in practice the target samples often arise from multiple latent or unknown domains, e.g., the images for cars may arise from latent domains such as photo, line drawing, cartoon, etc. The methods based on single-domain may no longer be feasible for multiple latent domains and may sometimes even lead to performance degeneration. To address the above issue, in this paper we propose the MRL (Model Reuse for multiple Latent domains) method. Both domain characteristics and pre-trained models are considered for the exploration of instances in the target task. Theoretically, the overall considerations are packed in a bi-level optimization framework with a reliable generalization. Moreover, through an ensemble of multiple models, the model robustness is improved with a theoretical guarantee. Empirical results on diverse real-world data sets clearly validate the effectiveness of proposed algorithms.",

In real-world applications, labels are usually collected from non-experts such as crowdsourcing to save cost and thus are noisy. In the past few years, deep learning methods for dealing with noisy labels have been developed, many of which are based on the small-loss criterion. However, there are few theoretical analyses to explain why these methods could learn well from noisy labels. In this paper, we theoretically explain why the widely-used small-loss criterion works. Based on the explanation, we reformalize the vanilla small-loss criterion to better tackle noisy labels.

        "abstract": "An intriguing phenomenon observed during training neural networks is the spectral bias, which states that neural networks are biased towards learning less complex functions. The priority of learning functions with low complexity might be at the core of explaining the generalization ability of neural networks, and certain efforts have been made to provide a theoretical explanation for spectral bias. However, there is still no satisfying theoretical result justifying the underlying mechanism of spectral bias. In this paper, we give a comprehensive and rigorous explanation for spectral bias and relate it with the neural tangent kernel function proposed in recent work. We prove that the training process of neural networks can be decomposed along different directions defined by the eigenfunctions of the neural tangent kernel, where each direction has its own convergence rate and the rate is determined by the corresponding eigenvalue. We then provide a case study when the input data is uniformly distributed over the unit sphere, and show that lower degree spherical harmonics are easier to be learned by over-parameterized neural networks. Finally, we provide numerical experiments to demonstrate the correctness of our theory. Our experimental results also show that our theory can tolerate certain model misspecification in terms of the input data distribution.",

This task is defined as Unsupervised Deformable-Instances Image-to-Image Translation (UDIT), which maps multiple foreground instances of a source domain to a target domain, involving significant changes in shape. In this paper, we propose an effective pipeline named Mask-Guided Deformable-instances GAN (MGD-GAN) which first generates target masks in batch and then utilizes them to synthesize corresponding instances on the background image, with all instances efficiently translated and background well preserved. To promote the quality of synthesized images and stabilize the training, we design an elegant training procedure which transforms the unsupervised mask-to-instance process into a supervised way by creating paired examples. To objectively evaluate the performance of UDIT task, we design new evaluation metrics which are based on the object detection. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the significant advantages of our MGD-GAN over existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Furthermore, our training time consumption is hugely reduced compared to the state-of-the-art. The code could be available at https://github.com/sitongsu/MGD_GAN.",

As one of the fundamental research tasks in domains like intelligent education, a number of Cognitive Diagnosis Models (CDMs) have been developed in the past decades. Though these solutions are usually well designed based on psychometric theories, they still suffer from the limited ability of the handcrafted diagnosis functions, especially when dealing with heterogeneous data. In this paper, I will share my personal understanding of cognitive diagnosis and review our recent developments of CDMs mostly from a machine learning perspective. Meanwhile, I will show the wide applications of cognitive diagnosis.",

Our pipeline first generates tracklet proposals,  then refines these tracklets and associates them to generate long trajectories. Specifically, object proposal generation and motion regression are first performed on a point cloud sequence to generate tracklet candidates. Then, spatial-temporal features of each tracklet are exploited and their consistency is used to refine the tracklet proposal. Finally, the refined tracklets across multiple frames are associated to perform MOT on the point cloud sequence. The PC-TCNN significantly improves the MOT performance by introducing the tracklet proposal design. On the KITTI tracking benchmark, it attains an MOTA of 91.75%, outperforming all submitted results on the online leaderboard.",

In this paper, we study a continuous optimal route combination problem: Given a dynamic road network and a stream of trip queries, we continuously find an optimal route combination for each new query batch over the query stream such that the total travel time for all routes is minimized. Each route corresponds to a planning result for a particular trip query in the current query batch. Our problem targets a variety of applications, including traffic-flow management, real-time route planning and continuous congestion prevention. The exact algorithm bears exponential time complexity and is computationally prohibitive for application scenarios in dynamic traffic networks.  To address this problem, a self-aware batch processing algorithm is developed in this paper. Extensive experiments offer insight into the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid growth of traffic sensors deployed, a massive amount of traffic flow data are collected, revealing the long-term evolution of traffic flows and the gradual expansion of traffic networks. How to accurately forecasting these traffic flow attracts the attention of researchers as it is of great significance for improving the efficiency of transportation systems. However, existing methods mainly focus on the spatial-temporal correlation of static networks, leaving the problem of efficiently learning models on networks with expansion and evolving patterns less studied. To tackle this problem, we propose a Streaming Traffic Flow Forecasting Framework, TrafficStream,  based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Continual Learning (CL), achieving accurate predictions and high efficiency. Firstly, we design a traffic pattern fusion method, cleverly integrating the new patterns that emerged during the long-term period into the model. A JS-divergence-based algorithm is proposed to mine new traffic patterns. Secondly, we introduce CL to consolidate the knowledge learned previously and transfer them to the current model. Specifically, we adopt two strategies: historical data replay and parameter smoothing. We construct a streaming traffic data set to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our model. Extensive experiments demonstrate its excellent potential to extract traffic patterns with high efficiency on long-term streaming network scene.

        "abstract": "The Stratification of early-stage cancer patients for the prediction of clinical outcome is a challenging task since cancer is associated with various molecular aberrations. A single biomarker often cannot provide sufficient information to stratify early-stage patients effectively. Understanding the complex mechanism behind cancer development calls for exploiting biomarkers from multiple modalities of data such as histopathology images and genomic data. The integrative analysis of these biomarkers sheds light on cancer diagnosis, subtyping, and prognosis. Another difficulty is that labels for early-stage cancer patients are scarce and not reliable enough for predicting survival times. Given the fact that different cancer types share some commonalities, we explore if the knowledge learned from one cancer type can be utilized to improve prognosis accuracy for another cancer type. We propose a novel unsupervised multi-view transfer learning algorithm to simultaneously analyze multiple biomarkers in different cancer types. We integrate multiple views using non-negative matrix factorization and formulate the transfer learning model based on the Optimal Transport theory to align features of different cancer types. We evaluate the stratification performance on three early-stage cancers from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. Comparing with other benchmark methods, our framework achieves superior accuracy for patient outcome prediction.",

Though deep learning methods can boost forecasting accuracy, they often sacrifice interpretability. In this paper, we present a new scheme of series saliency to boost both accuracy and interpretability. By extracting series images from sliding windows of the time series, we design series saliency as a mixup strategy with a learnable mask between the series images and their perturbed versions. Series saliency is model agnostic and performs as an adaptive data augmentation method for training deep models. Moreover, by slightly changing the objective, we optimize series saliency to find a mask for interpretable forecasting in both feature and time dimensions. Experimental results on several real datasets demonstrate that series saliency is effective to produce accurate time-series forecasting results as well as generate temporal interpretations.",

This establishes a new direction of studies in the area of graph games, motivated by applications such as influence spreading. As a first step, we investigate the existence of Nash equilibria in competitive diffusion and Voronoi games on different temporal graph classes. Even when restricting our studies to temporal paths and cycles, this turns out to be a challenging undertaking, revealing significant differences between the two games in the temporal setting. Notably, both games are equivalent on static paths and cycles. Our two main technical results are (algorithmic) proofs for the existence of Nash equilibria in temporal competitive diffusion and temporal Voronoi games when the edges are restricted not to disappear over time.",

In our model, each agent is matched to multiple agents on the other side over whom she has additive preferences. We demand fairness for each side separately, giving rise to notions such as double envy-freeness up to one match (DEF1) and double maximin share guarantee (DMMS). We show that (a slight strengthening of) DEF1 cannot always be achieved, but in the special case where both sides have identical preferences, the round-robin algorithm with a carefully designed agent ordering achieves it. In contrast, DMMS cannot be achieved even when both sides have identical preferences.",

        "abstract": "Learning correspondence between sets of objects is a key component in many machine learning tasks.Recently, optimal Transport (OT) has been successfully applied to such correspondence problems and it  is  appealing  as  a  fully  unsupervised  approach. However,  OT  requires  pairwise  instances  be  directly comparable in a common metric space. This limits its applicability when feature spaces are of different dimensions or not directly comparable. In addition,  OT only focuses on pairwise correspondence without sensing global transformations.  To address these challenges, we propose a new method to jointly learn the optimal coupling between twosets,  and  the  optimal  transformations  (e.g.   rotation,  projection and scaling) of each set based on a two-sided Wassertein Procrustes analysis (TWP). Since the joint problem is a non-convex optimization problem, we present a reformulation that renders the problem component-wise convex. We then propose a novel algorithm to solve the problem harnessing a Gauss\u2013Seidel method. We further present competitive  results  of TWP  on  various  applicationscompared with state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "We consider non-cooperative facility location games where both facilities and clients act strategically and heavily influence each other. This contrasts established game-theoretic facility location models with non-strategic clients that simply select the closest opened facility. In our model, every facility location has a set of attracted clients and each client has a set of shopping locations and a weight that corresponds to its spending capacity. Facility agents selfishly select a location for opening their facility to maximize the attracted total spending capacity, whereas clients strategically decide how to distribute their spending capacity among the opened facilities in their shopping range. We focus on a natural client behavior similar to classical load balancing: our selfish clients aim for a distribution that minimizes their maximum waiting time for getting serviced, where a facility\u2019s waiting time corresponds to its total attracted client weight.\r\n\r\nWe show that subgame perfect equilibria exist and we give almost tight constant bounds on the Price of Anarchy and the Price of Stability, which even hold for a broader class of games with arbitrary client behavior. Since facilities and clients influence each other, it is crucial for the facilities to anticipate the selfish clients\u2019 behavior when selecting their location. For this, we provide an efficient algorithm that also implies an efficient check for equilibrium. Finally, we show that computing a socially optimal facility placement is NP-hard and that this result holds for all feasible client weight distributions.",

        "abstract": "Learning from label proportions (LLP) aims at learning an instance-level classifier with label proportions in grouped training data. Existing deep learning based LLP methods utilize end-to-end pipelines to obtain the proportional loss with Kullback-Leibler divergence between the bag-level prior and posterior class distributions. However, the unconstrained optimization on this objective can hardly reach a solution in accordance with the given proportions. Besides, concerning the probabilistic classifier, this strategy unavoidably results in high-entropy conditional class distributions at the instance level. These issues further degrade the performance of the instance-level classification. In this paper, we regard these problems as noisy pseudo labeling, and instead impose the strict proportion consistency on the classifier with a constrained optimization as a continuous training stage for existing LLP classifiers. In addition, we introduce the mixup strategy and symmetric cross-entropy to further reduce the label noise. Our framework is model-agnostic, and demonstrates compelling performance improvement in extensive experiments, when incorporated into other deep LLP models as a post-hoc phase.",

To overcome these limitations, we propose an Invisible Mobile Keyboard (IMK), which lets users freely type on the desired area without any constraints. To facilitate a data-driven IMK decoding task, we have collected the most extensive text-entry dataset (approximately 2M pairs of typing positions and the corresponding characters). Additionally, we propose our baseline decoder along with a semantic typo correction mechanism based on self-attention, which decodes such unconstrained inputs with high accuracy (96.0%). Moreover, the user study reveals that the users could type faster and feel convenience and satisfaction to IMK with our decoder. Lastly, we make the source code and the dataset public to contribute to the research community.",

        "abstract": "Previous work on satisficing planning using greedy best-first search (GBFS) has shown that non-greedy, randomized exploration can help escape uninformative heuristic regions and solve hard problems faster. Despite their success when used with GBFS, such exploration techniques cannot be directly applied to bounded suboptimal algorithms like Weighted A* (WA*) without losing the solution-quality guarantees. In this work, we present Type-WA*, a novel bounded suboptimal planning algorithm that augments WA* with type-based exploration while still satisfying WA*'s theoretical solution-quality guarantee. Our empirical analysis shows that Type-WA* significantly increases the number of solved problems, when used in conjunction with each of three popular heuristics. Our analysis also provides insight into the runtime vs. solution cost trade-off.",

        "abstract": "To improve the accessibility of smart devices and to simplify their usage, building models which understand user interfaces (UIs) and assist users to complete their tasks is critical. However, unique challenges are proposed by UI-specific characteristics, such as how to effectively leverage multimodal UI features that involve image, text, and structural metadata and how to achieve good performance when high-quality labeled data is unavailable. To address such challenges we introduce UIBert, a transformer-based joint image-text model trained through novel pre-training tasks on large-scale unlabeled UI data to learn generic feature representations for a UI and its components. Our key intuition is that the heterogeneous features in a UI are self-aligned, i.e., the image and text features of UI components, are predictive of each other. We propose five pretraining tasks utilizing this self-alignment among different features of a UI component and across various components in the same UI. We evaluate our method on nine real-world downstream UI tasks where UIBert outperforms strong multimodal baselines by up to 9.26% accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, news recommendation has become a popular channel for users to access news of their interests. How to represent rich textual contents of news and precisely match users' interests and candidate news lies in the core of news recommendation. However, existing recommendation methods merely learn textual representations from in-domain news data, which limits their generalization ability to new news that are common in cold-start scenarios. Meanwhile, many of these methods represent each user by aggregating the historically browsed news into a single vector and then compute the matching score with the candidate news vector, which may lose the low-level matching signals. In this paper, we explore the use of the successful BERT pre-training technique in NLP for news recommendation and propose a BERT-based user-news matching model, called UNBERT. In contrast to existing research, our UNBERT model not only leverages the pre-trained model with rich language knowledge to enhance textual representation, but also captures multi-grained user-news matching signals at both word-level and news-level. Extensive experiments on the Microsoft News Dataset (MIND) demonstrate that our approach constantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

Metric learning based approaches have been widely investigated, where a query sample is classified by finding the nearest prototype from the support set based on their feature similarities. A neural network has different uncertainties on its calculated similarities of different pairs. Understanding and modeling the uncertainty on the similarity could promote the exploitation of limited samples in few-shot optimization. In this work, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Few-Shot framework for image classification by modeling uncertainty of the similarities of query-support pairs and performing uncertainty-aware optimization. Particularly, we exploit such uncertainty by converting observed similarities to probabilistic representations and incorporate them to the loss for more effective optimization. In order to jointly consider the similarities between a query and the prototypes in a support set, a graph-based model is utilized to estimate the uncertainty of the pairs.

Recent approaches to training BNNs have produced impressive results, but minimizing the drop in accuracy from full precision networks is still challenging. One reason is that conventional BNNs ignore the uncertainty caused by weights that are near zero, resulting in the instability or frequent flip while learning. In this work, we investigate the intrinsic uncertainty of vanishing near-zero weights, making the training vulnerable to instability. We introduce an uncertainty-aware  BNN (UaBNN) by leveraging  a new mapping function called certainty-sign (c-sign)  to reduce these weights' uncertainties. Our c-sign function is the first to train BNNs with a  decreasing uncertainty for binarization.  The approach leads to a  controlled  learning process for BNNs. We also introduce a simple but effective method to measure the uncertainty-based on a Gaussian function. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method improves multiple BNN methods by maintaining stability  of  training, and achieves a higher performance over prior arts.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks on the graph structure. Although multiple works have been proposed to improve their robustness against such structural adversarial attacks, the reasons for the success of the attacks remain unclear. In this work, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that structural adversarial examples can be attributed to the non-robust aggregation scheme (i.e., the weighted mean) of GCNs. Specifically, our analysis takes advantage of the breakdown point which can quantitatively measure the robustness of aggregation schemes. The key insight is that weighted mean, as the basic design of GCNs, has a low breakdown point and its output can be dramatically changed by injecting a single edge. We show that adopting the aggregation scheme with a high breakdown point (e.g., median or trimmed mean) could significantly enhance the robustness of GCNs against structural attacks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that such a simple but effective method achieves the best robustness performance compared to state-of-the-art models.",

        "abstract": "Anomaly detection presents a unique challenge in machine learning, due to the scarcity of labeled anomaly data. Recent work attempts to mitigate such problems by augmenting training of deep anomaly detection models with additional labeled anomaly samples. However, the labeled data often does not align with the target distribution and introduces harmful bias to the trained model. In this paper, we aim to understand the effect of a biased anomaly set on anomaly detection. Concretely, we view anomaly detection as a supervised learning task where the objective is to optimize the recall at a given false positive rate. We formally study the relative scoring bias of an anomaly detector, defined as the difference in performance with respect to a baseline anomaly detector. We establish the first finite sample rates for estimating the relative scoring bias for deep anomaly detection, and empirically validate our theoretical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We also provide an extensive empirical study on how a biased training anomaly set affects the anomaly score function and therefore the detection performance on different anomaly classes. Our study demonstrates scenarios in which the biased anomaly set can be useful or problematic, and provides a solid benchmark for future research.",

        "abstract": "Hypergraph, an expressive structure with flexibility to model the higher-order correlations among entities, has recently attracted increasing attention from various research domains. Despite the success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for graph representation learning, how to adapt the powerful GNN-variants directly into hypergraphs remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose UniGNN, a unified framework for interpreting the message passing process in graph and hypergraph neural networks, which can generalize general GNN models into hypergraphs. In this framework, meticulously-designed architectures aiming to deepen GNNs can also be incorporated into hypergraphs with the least effort. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of UniGNN on multiple real-world datasets, which outperform the state-of-the-art approaches with a large margin. Especially for the DBLP dataset, we increase the accuracy from 77.4% to 88.8% in the semi-supervised hypernode classification task. We further prove that the proposed message-passing based UniGNN models are at most as powerful as the 1-dimensional Generalized Weisfeiler-Leman (1-GWL) algorithm in terms of distinguishing non-isomorphic hypergraphs.

Recently we have seen rapidly growing interest in integrating knowledge bases into dialogue systems. However, existing approaches mostly deal with knowledge bases of a single modality, typically textual information. As today's knowledge bases become abundant with multimodal information such as images, audios and videos, the limitation of existing approaches greatly hinders the development of dialogue systems. In this paper, we focus on task-oriented dialogue systems and address this limitation by proposing a novel model that integrates external multimodal KB reasoning with pre-trained language models. We further enhance the model via a novel multi-granularity fusion mechanism to capture multi-grained semantics in the dialogue history. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we collect a new large-scale (14K) dialogue dataset MMDialKB, built upon multimodal KB. Both automatic and human evaluation results on MMDialKB demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over strong baselines.",

We propose a novel intervention-aware estimator to bridge this online/counterfactual division. The estimator corrects for the effect of position bias, trust bias, and item-selection bias by using corrections based on the behavior of the logging policy and on online interventions: changes to the logging policy made during the gathering of click data. Our experimental results show that, unlike existing counterfactual LTR methods, the intervention-aware estimator can greatly benefit from online interventions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that is shown to be highly effective in both online and counterfactual scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Many unsupervised hashing methods are implicitly established on the idea of reconstructing the input data, which basically encourages the hashing codes to retain as much information of original data as possible. However, this requirement may force the models spending lots of their effort on reconstructing the unuseful background information, while ignoring to preserve the discriminative semantic information that is more important for the hashing task. To tackle this problem, inspired by the recent success of contrastive learning in learning continuous representations, we propose to adapt this framework to learn binary hashing codes. Specifically, we first propose to modify the objective function to meet the specific requirement of hashing and then introduce a probabilistic binary representation layer into the model to facilitate end-to-end training of the entire model. We further prove the strong connection between the proposed contrastive-learning-based hashing method and the mutual information, and show that the proposed model can be considered under the broader framework of the information bottleneck (IB). Under this perspective, a more general hashing model is naturally obtained. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark image datasets demonstrate that the proposed hashing method significantly outperforms existing baselines.",

The existing methods can be divided into the embedding-based models, and the conventional reasoning and lexical matching based systems. The former compute the similarity of entities via their cross-KG embeddings, but they usually rely on an ideal supervised learning setting for good performance and lack appropriate reasoning to avoid logically wrong mappings; while the latter address the reasoning issue but are poor at utilizing the KG graph structures and the entity contexts. In this study, we aim at combining the above two solutions and thus propose an iterative framework named PRASE which is based on probabilistic reasoning and semantic embedding. It learns the KG embeddings via entity mappings from a probabilistic reasoning system named PARIS, and feeds the resultant entity mappings and embeddings back into PARIS for augmentation. The PRASE framework is compatible with different embedding-based models, and our experiments on multiple datasets have demonstrated its state-of-the-art performance.",

The method is based on an autoencoder that factors each input image into depth, albedo, viewpoint and illumination. In order to disentangle these components without supervision, we use the fact that many object categories have, at least approximately, a symmetric structure. We show that reasoning about illumination allows us to exploit the underlying object symmetry even if the appearance is not symmetric due to shading. Furthermore, we model objects that are probably, but not certainly, symmetric by predicting a symmetry probability map, learned end-to-end with the other components of the model. Our experiments show that this method can recover very accurately the 3D shape of human faces, cat faces and cars from single-view images, without any supervision or a prior shape model.

        "abstract": "Path representations are critical in a variety of transportation applications, such as estimating path ranking in path recommendation systems and estimating path travel time in navigation systems. Existing studies often learn task-specific path representations in a supervised manner, which require a large amount of labeled training data and generalize poorly to other tasks. We propose an unsupervised learning framework Path InfoMax (PIM) to learn generic path representations that work for different downstream tasks. We first propose a curriculum negative sampling method, for each input path, to generate a small amount of negative paths, by following the principles of curriculum learning. Next, PIM employs mutual information maximization to learn path representations from both a global and a local view.  In the global view, PIM distinguishes the representations of the input paths from those of the negative paths. In the local view, PIM distinguishes the input path representations from the representations of the nodes that appear only in the negative paths. This enables the learned path representations encode both global and local information at different scales. Extensive experiments on two downstream tasks, ranking score estimation and travel time estimation, using two road network datasets suggest that PIM significantly outperforms other unsupervised methods and is also able to be used as a pre-training method to enhance supervised path representation learning.",

To solve the UPL\r\nproblem we propose the Self-Taught Associative Memory (STAM) architecture.\r\nLayered hierarchies of STAM modules learn based on a combination of online\r\nclustering, novelty detection, forgetting outliers, and storing only prototypical\r\nfeatures rather than specific examples. We evaluate STAM representations using\r\nclustering and classification tasks. While there are no existing learning scenarios\r\nthat are directly comparable to UPL, we compare the STAM architecture with two\r\nrecent continual learning models, Memory Aware Synapses (MAS) and Gradient\r\nEpisodic Memories (GEM), after adapting them in the UPL setting.",

        "abstract": "For many Internet companies, it has been an important focus to improve user retention rate. To achieve this goal, we need to recommend proper services in order to meet the demands of users.  Unlike conventional click-through rate (CTR) estimation, there are lots of noise in the collected data when modeling retention, caused by two major issues: 1) implicit impression-revisit effect: users could revisit the APP even if they do not explicitly interact with the recommender system; 2) selection bias: recommender system suffers from selection bias caused by user's self-selection. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel method named UR-IPW (User Retention Modeling with Inverse Propensity Weighting), which 1) makes full use of both explicit and implicit interactions in the observed data. 2) models revisit rate estimation from a causal perspective accounting for the selection bias problem. The experiments on both offline and online environments from different scenarios demonstrate the superiority of UR-IPW over previous methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to model user retention by estimating the revisit rate from a causal perspective.",

Existing news recommendation methods usually model users' interest from their behaviors via sequential or attentive models. However, they cannot model the rich relatedness between user behaviors, which can provide useful contexts of these behaviors for user interest modeling.  In this paper, we propose a novel user modeling approach for news recommendation, which models each user as a personalized heterogeneous graph built from user behaviors to better capture the fine-grained behavior relatedness. In addition, in order to learn user interest embedding from the personalized heterogeneous graph, we propose a novel heterogeneous graph pooling method, which can summarize both node features and graph topology, and be aware of the varied characteristics of different types of nodes. Experiments on large-scale benchmark dataset show the proposed methods can effectively improve the performance of user modeling for news recommendation.",

In this paper, we present a novel approach to explanatory\r\ndiagnosis, based on the assumption that most failures occur due to some\r\nrobot hardware failure. We model the robot platform components with\r\nstate machines and formulate action variants for the robots' actions,\r\nmodelling different fault modes. We apply diagnosis as\r\nplanning with a top-k planning approach to determine possible diagnosis\r\ncandidates and then use active diagnosis to find out which of those\r\ncandidates is the true diagnosis.  Finally, based on the platform model,\r\nwe recover from the occurred failure such that the robot can continue to\r\noperate.

        "abstract": "Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms allow us to combine model-generated data with those collected from interaction with the real system in order to alleviate the data efficiency problem in RL. However, designing such algorithms is often challenging because the bias in simulated data may overshadow the ease of data generation. A potential solution to this challenge is to jointly learn and improve model and policy using a universal objective function. In this paper, we leverage the connection between RL and probabilistic inference, and formulate such an objective function as a variational lower-bound of a log-likelihood. This allows us to use expectation maximization (EM) and iteratively fix a baseline policy and learn a variational distribution, consisting of a model and a policy (E-step), followed by improving the baseline policy given the learned variational distribution (M-step). We propose model-based and model-free policy iteration (actor-critic) style algorithms for the E-step and show how the variational distribution learned by them can be used to optimize the M-step in a fully model-based fashion. Our experiments on a number of continuous control tasks show that our model-based (E-step) algorithm, called variational model-based policy optimization (VMBPO), is more sample-efficient and robust to hyper-parameter tuning than its model-free (E-step) counterpart. Using the same control tasks, we also compare VMBPO with several state-of-the-art model-based and model-free RL algorithms and show its sample efficiency and performance.",

The reward is crucial for deal with the video summarization task via reinforcement learning, since the reward signal defines the goal of video summarization. However, existing reward mechanism in reinforcement learning cannot handle the ambiguity which appears frequently in video summarization, i.e., the diverse consciousness by different people on the same video. To solve this problem, in this paper label distributions are mapped from the CNN and LSTM-based state representation to capture the subjectiveness of video summaries. The dual-reward is designed by measuring the similarity between user score distributions and the generated label distributions. Not only the average score but also the the variance of the subjective opinions are considered in summary generation.

In addition, the parameters of matching module are initialized via pre-training based on annotated images to improve the matching performance.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel task, referred to as Weakly-Supervised Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection (WSSTAD) in surveillance video. Specifically, given an untrimmed video, WSSTAD aims to localize a spatio-temporal tube (i.e., a sequence of bounding boxes at consecutive times) that encloses the abnormal event, with only coarse video-level annotations as supervision during training. To address this challenging task, we propose a dual-branch network which takes as input the proposals with multi-granularities in both spatial-temporal domains. Each branch employs a relationship reasoning module to capture the correlation between tubes/videolets, which can provide rich contextual information and complex entity relationships for the concept learning of abnormal behaviors. Mutually-guided Progressive Refinement framework is set up to employ dual-path mutual guidance in a recurrent manner, iteratively sharing auxiliary supervision information across branches. It impels the learned concepts of each branch to serve as a guide for its counterpart, which progressively refines the corresponding branch and the whole framework. Furthermore, we contribute two datasets, i.e., ST-UCF-Crime and STRA, consisting of videos containing spatio-temporal abnormal annotations to serve as the benchmarks for WSSTAD. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and analyze the key factors that contribute more to handle this task.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of distinguishing two machine learning (ML) models built for the same task in a human-interpretable way. As models can fail or succeed in different ways, classical accuracy metrics may mask crucial qualitative differences. This problem arises in a few contexts. In business applications with periodically retrained models, an updated model may deviate from its predecessor for some segments without a change in overall accuracy. In automated ML systems, where several ML pipelines are generated, the top pipelines have comparable accuracy but may have more subtle differences. We present a method for interpretable comparison of binary classification models by approximating them with Boolean decision rules. We introduce stabilization conditions that allow for the two rule sets to be more directly comparable. A method is proposed to compare two rule sets based on their statistical and semantic similarity by solving assignment problems and highlighting changes.  An empirical evaluation on several benchmark datasets illustrates the insights that may be obtained and shows that artificially induced changes can be reliably recovered by our method.",

        "abstract": "Egocentric action anticipation aims at predicting the near future based on past observation in first-person vision. While future actions may be wrongly predicted due to the dataset bias, we present a counterfactual analysis framework for egocentric action anticipation (CA-EAA) to enhance the capacity. In the factual case, we can predict the upcoming action based on visual features and semantic labels from past observation. Imagining one counterfactual situation where no visual representation had been observed, we would obtain a counterfactual predicted action only using past semantic labels. In this way, we can reduce the side-effect caused by semantic labels via a comparison between factual and counterfactual outcomes, which moves a step towards unbiased prediction for egocentric action anticipation.  We conduct experiments on two large-scale egocentric video datasets. Qualitative and quantitative results validate the effectiveness of our proposed CA-EAA.",

In this paper, we examine not only these but the many other assumptions made in the context of model-based goal recognition. By exploring their meaning, the relationships between them and the confusions that can arise, we demonstrate their importance, shed light on the way trends emerge in AI, and suggest a novel means for researchers to uncover suitable avenues for future work.",

In this paper, we observe that there are three \"drivers\" that impose requirements on spatially intelligent agents and thus VPR systems: 1) the particular agent including its sensors and computational resources, 2) the operating environment of this agent, and 3) the specific task that the artificial agent carries out. In this paper, we characterize and survey key works in the VPR area considering those drivers, including their place representation and place matching choices. We also provide a new definition of VPR based on the visual overlap - akin to spatial view cells in the brain - that enables us to find similarities and differences to other research areas in the robotics and computer vision fields.

We take a novel approach to the study of the power of big vs.~small players in these games. We model small (big) players as having single (multiple) votes. The aggregate relative power of big players is measured w.r.t.~their votes proportion. \r\nFor this ratio, we show small constant worst-case bounds for the Shapley-Shubik and the Deegan-Packel indices. In sharp contrast, this ratio is unbounded for the Banzhaf index. As an application, we define a false-name strategic normal form game where each big player may split its votes between false identities, and study its various properties. Together our results provide foundations for the implications of players' size, modeled as their ability to split, on their relative power.",

        "abstract": "State-of-the-art image synthesis methods are mostly based on generative adversarial networks and require large dataset and extensive training. Although the model-inversion-oriented branch of methods eliminate the training requirement, the quality of the resulting image tends to be limited due to the lack of sufficient natural and class-specific information. In this paper, we introduce a novel strategy for high fidelity image synthesis with a single pretrained classification network. The strategy includes a class-conditional natural regularization design and a corresponding metadata collecting procedure for different scenarios. We show that our method can synthesize high quality natural images that closely follow the features of one or more given seed images. Moreover, our method achieves surprisingly decent results in the task of sketch-based image synthesis without training. Finally, our method further improves the performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency in the data-free knowledge distillation task.",

        "abstract": "Chinese character recognition has attracted much research interest due to its wide applications. Although it has been studied for many years, some issues in this field have not been completely resolved yet, \\textit{e.g.} the zero-shot problem. Previous character-based and radical-based methods have not fundamentally addressed the zero-shot problem since some characters or radicals in test sets may not appear in training sets under a data-hungry condition. Inspired by the fact that humans can generalize to know how to write characters unseen before if they have learned stroke orders of some characters, we propose a stroke-based method by decomposing each character into a sequence of strokes, which are the most basic units of Chinese characters. However, we observe that there is a one-to-many relationship between stroke sequences and Chinese characters. To tackle this challenge, we employ a matching-based strategy to transform the predicted stroke sequence to a specific character. We evaluate the proposed method on handwritten characters, printed artistic characters, and scene characters. The experimental results validate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods on both character zero-shot and radical zero-shot tasks. Moreover, the proposed method can be easily generalized to other languages whose characters can be decomposed into strokes.",

        "abstract": "k-Nearest Neighbors is one of the most fundamental but effective classification models. In this paper, we propose two families of models built on a sequence to sequence model and a memory network model to mimic the k-Nearest Neighbors model, which generate a sequence of labels, a sequence of out-of-sample feature vectors and a final label for classification, and thus they could also function as oversamplers. We also propose 'out-of-core' versions of our models which assume that only a small portion of data can be loaded into memory. Computational experiments show that our models on structured datasets outperform k-Nearest Neighbors, a feed-forward neural network, XGBoost, lightGBM, random forest and a memory network, due to the fact that our models must produce additional output and not just the label. On image and text datasets, the performance of our model is close to many state-of-the-art deep models. As an oversampler on imbalanced datasets, the sequence to sequence kNN model often outperforms Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and Adaptive Synthetic Sampling.",
