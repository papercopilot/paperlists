        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose Flash3D, a method for scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis from a single image which is both very generalisable and efficient. For generalisability, we start from a 'foundation' model for monocular depth estimation and extend it to a full 3D shape and appearance reconstructor. For efficiency, we base this extension on feed-forward Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, we predict a first layer of 3D Gaussians at the predicted depth, and then add additional layers of Gaussians that are offset in space, allowing the model to complete the reconstruction behind occlusions and truncations. Flash3D is very efficient, trainable on a single GPU in a day, and thus accessible to most researchers. It achieves state-of-the-art results when trained and tested on RealEstate10k. When transferred to unseen datasets like NYU it outperforms competitors by a large margin. More impressively, when transferred to KITTI, Flash3D achieves better PSNR than methods trained specifically on that dataset. In some instances, it even outperforms recent methods that use multiple views as input. Code, models, demo, and more results are available at https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/flash3d/.",

        "abstract": "Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) based on 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGS) has recently shown promise towards more accurate, dense 3D scene maps. However, existing 3DGS-based methods fail to address the global consistency of the scene via loop closure and/or global bundle adjustment. To this end, we propose LoopSplat, which takes RGB-D images as input and performs dense mapping with 3DGS submaps and frame-to-model tracking. LoopSplat triggers loop closure online and computes relative loop edge constraints between submaps directly via 3DGS registration, leading to improvements in efficiency and accuracy over traditional global-to-local point cloud registration. It uses a robust pose graph optimization formulation and rigidly aligns the submaps to achieve global consistency. Evaluation on the synthetic Replica and real-world TUM-RGBD, ScanNet, and ScanNet++ datasets demonstrates competitive or superior tracking, mapping, and rendering compared to existing methods for dense RGB-D SLAM. Code will be made available.",

        "abstract": "Relative pose estimation for RGB-D cameras is crucial in a number of applications. A typical approach relies on RANSAC to find a triplet pair of 3D point correspondences from which relative pose can be derived. A key aspect to this work ensures the geometric consistency of the triplet, {\\em i.e.}, pairwise distances between 3D points are preserved between the two views. Observe, however, that depth values are typically an order of magnitude less precise than feature locations, leading to large distance thresholds and admission of numerous false positives. This paper proposes that the constraint of 3D distance can be cast as a 2D constraint which we refer to as the {\\em Geometric Correspondence Constraint (GCC)}. This constraint states that given one pair of correspondences, the two images are partitioned into a family nested curves such that corresponding points must lie on corresponding curves. This can act as a filter in the RANSAC process with significant savings in computation and with increased robustness and accuracy as demonstrated in experiments using TUM, ICL-NUIM, and RGBD Scene v2 datasets.",

        "abstract": "We present a method for dynamic surface reconstruction of large-scale urban scenes from LiDAR. Depth-based reconstructions tend to focus on small-scale objects or large-scale SLAM reconstructions that treat moving objects as outliers. We take a holistic perspective and optimize a compositional model of a dynamic scene that decomposes the world into rigidly-moving objects and the background. To achieve this, we take inspiration from recent novel view synthesis methods and frame the reconstruction problem as a global optimization over neural surfaces, ego poses, and object poses, which minimizes the error between composed spacetime surfaces and input LiDAR scans. In contrast to view synthesis methods, which typically minimize 2D errors with gradient descent, we minimize a 3D point-to-surface error by coordinate descent, which we decompose into registration and surface reconstruction steps. Each step can be handled well by off-the-shelf methods without any re-training. We analyze the surface reconstruction step for rolling-shutter LiDARs, and show that deskewing operations common in continuous time SLAM can be applied to dynamic objects as well, improving results over prior art by 10X. Beyond pursuing dynamic reconstruction as a goal in and of itself, we propose that such a system can be used to auto-label partially annotated sequences and produce ground truth annotation for hard-to-label problems such as depth completion and scene flow.",

        "abstract": "Matching a 2D contour to a non-rigidly deformed 3D mesh is a challenging problem due to ambiguities arising from dimensionality differences. In the past, product graph based methods were only able to either produce fast but noisy solutions, or smooth but slow solutions (the latter enabled by higher-order costs computed in the conjugate product graph). In this work, we propose an approximation of these higher-order costs so that they can be computed in the ordinary product graph. This leads to an efficient algorithm for high-quality 2D-3D shape matching and enables novel applications, like an interactive user interface which allows to refine the solution gradually. We show theoretically that our method is efficient, and we experimentally validate that the accuracy gap of our approximation to the optimum is small in practice. Our code is available.",

This ensures topological consistency and non-intersecting trajectories while accommodating hard constraints, such as volume preservation, and soft constraints, e.g physical priors. \n\nCorrespondence is recovered using an efficient Varifold formulation, that is effective on high-fidelity surfaces with differing parameterizations. \n\nA simple skeleton structure augments the source shape, imposing physically motivated constraints on the deformation field and aiding in resolving symmetric ambiguities, without requiring skinning weights or prior knowledge of the skeleton's target pose configuration.\n\nQualitative and quantitative results demonstrate competitive or superior performance over existing state-of-the-art approaches in both shape correspondence and interpolation tasks across standard datasets.",

        "abstract": "Zero-shot 3D part segmentation is a challenging and fundamental task. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline, ZeroPS, which achieves high-quality knowledge transfer from 2D pretrained foundation models (FMs), SAM and GLIP, to 3D object point clouds. We aim to explore the natural relationship between multi-view correspondence and the FMs' prompt mechanism and build bridges on it. In ZeroPS, the relationship manifests as follows: 1) lifting 2D to 3D by leveraging co-viewed regions and SAM's prompt mechanism, 2) relating 1D classes to 3D parts by leveraging 2D-3D view projection and GLIP's prompt mechanism, and 3) enhancing prediction performance by leveraging multi-view observations. Extensive evaluations on the PartNetE and AKBSeg benchmarks demonstrate that ZeroPS significantly outperforms the SOTA method across zero-shot unlabeled and instance segmentation tasks. ZeroPS does not require additional training or fine-tuning for the FMs. ZeroPS applies to both simulated and real-world data. It is hardly affected by domain shift.

        "abstract": "Point cloud registration approaches often fail when the overlap between point clouds is low due to noisy point correspondences. This work introduces a novel cross-attention mechanism tailored for Transformer-based architectures that tackles this problem, by fusing information from coordinates and features at the super-point level between point clouds. This formulation has remained unexplored primarily because it must guarantee rotation and translation invariance since point clouds reside in different and independent reference frames. We integrate the Gromov\u2013Wasserstein distance into the cross-attention formulation to jointly compute distances between points across different point clouds\nand account for their geometric structure. By doing so, points from two distinct point clouds can attend to each other under arbitrary rigid transformations. At the point level, we also devise a self-attention mechanism that aggregates the local geometric structure information into point features for fine matching. Our formulation boosts the number of inlier correspondences, thereby yielding more precise registration results compared to state-of-the-art approaches. We have conducted an extensive evaluation on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, KITTI, and 3DCSR datasets. Project page: https://github.com/twowwj/FLAT.",

This paper proposes LapisGS, a layered 3DGS that supports adaptive streaming and progressive rendering. Our method constructs a layered structure for cumulative representation, incorporates dynamic opacity optimization to maintain visual fidelity, and utilizes occupancy maps to efficiently manage Gaussian splats. This proposed model offers a progressive representation supporting a continuous rendering quality adapted for bandwidth-aware streaming. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in balancing visual fidelity with the compactness of the model, with up to 50.71% improvement in SSIM, 286.53% improvement in LPIPS with 23% of the original model size, and shows its potential for bandwidth-adapted 3D streaming and rendering applications.",

        "abstract": "Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a task aiming at jointly recovering camera poses and 3D geometry of a scene given a set of images, remains a hard problem with still many open challenges despite decades of significant progress. The traditional solution for SfM consists of a complex pipeline of minimal solvers which tends to propagate errors and fails when images do not sufficiently overlap, have too little motion, etc. Recent methods have attempted to revisit this paradigm, but we empirically show that they fall short of fixing these core issues. In this paper, we propose instead to build upon a recently released foundation model for 3D vision that can robustly produce local 3D reconstructions and accurate matches. We introduce a low-memory approach to accurately align these local reconstructions in a global coordinate system. We further show that such foundation models can serve as efficient image retrievers without any overhead, reducing the overall complexity from quadratic to linear. Overall, our novel SfM pipeline is simple, scalable, fast and truly unconstrained, i.e. it can handle any collection of images, ordered or not. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our method provides steady performance across diverse settings, especially outperforming existing methods in small- and medium-scale settings.",

        "abstract": "Despite advances in text-to-3D generation methods, generation of multi-object arrangements remains challenging. Current methods exhibit failures in generating physically plausible arrangements that respect the provided text description. We present SceneMotifCoder (SMC), an example-driven framework for generating 3D object arrangements through visual program learning. SMC leverages large language models (LLMs) and program synthesis to overcome these challenges by learning visual programs from example arrangements. These programs are generalized into compact, editable meta-programs. When combined with 3D object retrieval and geometry-aware optimization, they can be used to create object arrangements varying in arrangement structure and contained objects. Our experiments show that SMC generates high-quality arrangements using meta-programs learned from few examples. Evaluation results demonstrates that object arrangements generated by SMC better conform to user-specified text descriptions and are more physically plausible when compared with state-of-the-art text-to-3D generation and layout methods.",

        "abstract": "Physically-based renderings contain Monte Carlo noise, with variance that increases as the number of rays per pixel decreases. This noise, while zero-mean for good modern renderers, can have heavy tails (most notably, for scenes containing specular or refractive objects). Learned methods for restoring low fidelity renders are highly developed, because suppressing render noise means one can save compute and use fast renders with few rays per pixel. We demonstrate that a diffusion model can denoise low fidelity renders successfully. Furthermore, our method can be conditioned on a variety of natural render information, and this conditioning helps performance. Quantitative experiments show that our method is competitive with SOTA across a range of sampling rates. Qualitative examination of the reconstructions suggests that the image prior applied by a diffusion method strongly favors reconstructions that are like real images -- so have straight shadow boundaries, curved specularities and no fireflies.",

        "abstract": "Creating personalized 3D animations with precise control and realistic head motions remains challenging for current speech-driven 3D facial animation methods. Editing these animations is especially complex and time consuming, requires precise control and typically handled by highly skilled animators. Most existing works focus on controlling style or emotion of the synthesized animation and cannot edit/regenerate parts of an input animation. They also overlook the fact that multiple plausible lip and head movements can match the same audio input. To address these challenges, we present 3DiFACE, a novel method for holistic speech-driven 3D facial animation. Our approach produces diverse plausible lip and head motions for a single audio input and  allows for editing via keyframing and interpolation. Specifically, we propose a fully-convolutional diffusion model that can leverage the viseme-level diversity in our training corpus. Additionally, we employ a speaking-style personalization and a novel sparsely-guided motion diffusion to enable precise control and editing. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that our method is capable of generating and editing diverse holistic 3D facial animations given a single audio input, with control between high fidelity and diversity.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces GS-Pose, a unified framework for localizing and estimating the 6D pose of novel objects. GS-Pose begins with a set of posed RGB images of a previously unseen object and builds three distinct representations stored in a database. At inference, GS-Pose operates sequentially by locating the object in the input image, estimating its initial 6D pose using a retrieval approach, and refining the pose with a render-and-compare method. The key insight is the application of the appropriate object representation at each stage of the process. In particular, for the refinement step, we leverage 3D Gaussian splatting, a novel differentiable rendering technique that offers high rendering speed and relatively low optimization time. Off-the-shelf toolchains and commodity hardware, such as mobile phones, can be used to capture new objects to be added to the database. Extensive evaluations on the LINEMOD and OnePose-LowTexture datasets demonstrate excellent performance, establishing the new state-of-the-art. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/dingdingcai/GSPose.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we address the challenge of accurate 3D human pose and shape (HPS) estimation from monocular images. The key to accuracy and robustness lies in high-quality training data. Existing training datasets containing real images with pseudo ground truth (pGT) use SMPLify to fit SMPL to sparse 2D joint locations, assuming a simplified camera with default intrinsics. We make two contributions that improve pGT accuracy.\nFirst, to estimate camera intrinsics, we develop a field-of-view prediction model HumanFoV trained on a dataset of images containing people. We use the estimated intrinsics to enhance the 4D-Humans dataset by incorporating a full perspective camera model during SMPLify fitting.\nSecond, 2D joints provide limited constraints on 3D body shape, often resulting in average-looking bodies. To address this, we use the BEDLAM dataset to train a dense surface keypoint detector. We apply this detector to the 4D-Humans dataset and modify SMPLify to fit the detected keypoints, resulting in significantly more realistic body shapes.\nFinally, we enhance the HMR2.0 architecture to include the estimated camera parameters. We iterate the process of model training and SMPLify fitting initialized with the previously trained model. This leads to more accurate pGT and significant performance gains. Our method, CameraHMR, achieves state-of-the-art 3D accuracy on HPS benchmarks. Code will be available for research purposes.",

Yet, they are limited to reasoning within a specific set of concepts, i.e. the vocabulary, prompted by the user at test time. \nIn essence, these models cannot reason in an open-ended fashion, i.e., answering ``What are the objects in the scene?''.\nWe introduce the first method to address 3D instance segmentation in a setting that is void of any vocabulary prior, namely a vocabulary-free setting.\nWe leverage a large vision-language assistant and an open-vocabulary 2D instance segmenter to discover and ground semantic categories on the posed images. \nTo form 3D instance mask, we first partition the input point cloud into dense superpoints, which are then merged into 3D instance masks. We propose a novel superpoint merging strategy via spectral clustering, accounting for both mask coherence and semantic coherence that are estimated from the 2D object instance masks.\nWe evaluate our method using ScanNet200 and Replica, outperforming existing methods in both vocabulary-free and open-vocabulary settings.  \nCode will be made available.",

        "abstract": "Scene flow, which provides the 3D motion field of the first frame from two consecutive point clouds, is vital for dynamic scene perception. However, contemporary scene flow methods face three major challenges. Firstly, they lack global flow embedding or only consider the context of individual point clouds before embedding, leading to embedded points struggling to perceive the consistent semantic relationship of another frame. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Dual Cross Attentive (DCA) for the latent fusion and alignment between two frames based on semantic contexts. This is then integrated into Global Fusion Flow Embedding (GF) to initialize flow embedding based on global correlations in both contextual and Euclidean spaces. Secondly, deformations exist in non-rigid objects after the warping layer, which distorts the spatiotemporal relation between the consecutive frames. For a more precise estimation of residual flow at next-level, the Spatial Temporal Re-embedding (STR) module is devised to update the point sequence features at current-level. Lastly, poor generalization is often observed due to the significant domain gap between synthetic and LiDAR-scanned datasets. We leverage novel domain adaptive losses to effectively bridge the gap of motion inference from synthetic to real-world. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across various datasets, with particularly outstanding results in real-world LiDAR-scanned situations.",

To address this issue, we propose MLI-NeRF, which integrates Multiple Light information in Intrinsic-aware Neural Radiance Fields. By leveraging scene information provided by different light source positions complementing the multi-view information, we generate pseudo-label images for reflectance and shading to guide intrinsic image decomposition without the need for ground truth data. Our method introduces straightforward supervision for intrinsic component separation and ensures robustness across diverse scene types.

        "abstract": "We introduce Joker, a new method for the conditional synthesis of 3D human heads with extreme expressions. Given a single reference image of a person, we synthesize a volumetric human head with the reference\u2019s identity and a new expression. We offer control over the expression via a 3D morphable model (3DMM) and textual inputs. This multi-modal conditioning signal is essential since 3DMMs alone fail to define subtle emotional changes and extreme expressions, including those involving the mouth cavity and tongue articulation. Our method is built upon a 2D diffusion-based prior that generalizes well to out-of-domain samples, such as sculptures, heavy makeup, and paintings while achieving high levels of expressiveness. To improve view consistency, we propose a new 3D distillation technique that converts predictions of our 2D prior into a neural radiance field (NeRF). Both the 2D prior and our distillation technique produce state-of-the-art results, which are confirmed by our extensive evaluations. Also, to the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to achieve view-consistent extreme tongue articulation.",

        "abstract": "Human activities are inherently complex, and even simple household tasks involve numerous object interactions. To better understand these activities and behaviors, it is crucial to model their dynamic interactions with the environment. The recent availability of affordable head-mounted cameras and egocentric data offers a more accessible and efficient means to understand dynamic human-object interactions in 3D environments. However, most existing methods for human activity modeling either focus on reconstructing 3D models of hand-object or human-scene interactions or on mapping 3D scenes, neglecting dynamic interactions with objects. The few existing solutions often require inputs from multiple sources, including multi-camera setups, depth-sensing cameras, or kinesthetic sensors. To this end, we introduce EgoGaussian, the first method capable of simultaneously reconstructing 3D scenes and dynamically tracking 3D object motion from RGB egocentric input alone. We leverage the uniquely discrete nature of Gaussian Splatting and segment dynamic interactions from the background. Our approach employs a clip-level online learning pipeline that leverages the dynamic nature of human activities, allowing us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the scene in chronological order and track rigid object motion. Additionally, our method automatically segments object and background Gaussians, providing 3D representations for both static scenes and dynamic objects. EgoGaussian outperforms previous NeRF and Dynamic Gaussian methods in challenging in-the-wild videos and we also qualitatively demonstrate the high quality of the reconstructed models.",

        "abstract": "Separable 3D reconstruction of multiple objects from multi-view RGB images\u2014resulting in two different 3D shapes for the two objects with a clear separation between them\u2014remains a sparely researched problem. It is challenging due to severe mutual occlusions and ambiguities\nalong the objects\u2019 interaction boundaries. This paper investigates the setting and introduces a new neuro-implicit method that can reconstruct the geometry and appearance of two objects undergoing close interactions while disjoining both in 3D, avoiding surface inter-penetrations and enabling novel-view synthesis of the observed scene. In our approach, the objects in the scene are first encoded using a shared multi-resolution hash grid. Next, its features are decoded into two neural SDFs for the respective objects. The framework is end-to-end trainable and supervised using a novel alpha-blending regularization that ensures that the two geometries are well separated even under extreme occlusions. Our reconstruction method is markerless and can be applied to rigid as well as articulated objects. We introduce a new dataset consisting of close interactions between a human and an object and also evaluate on two scenes of humans performing martial arts. The experiments confirm the effectiveness of our framework and substantial improvements using 3D and novel view synthesis metrics compared to several existing approaches applicable in our setting.",

        "abstract": "Novel view synthesis techniques predominantly utilize RGB cameras, inheriting their limitations such as the need for sufficient lighting, susceptibility to motion blur, and restricted dynamic range. In contrast, event cameras are significantly more resilient to these limitations but have been less explored in this domain, particularly in large-scale settings. Current methodologies primarily focus on front-facing or object-oriented (360-degree view) scenarios. For the first time, we introduce 3D Gaussians for event-based novel view synthesis. Our method reconstructs large and unbounded scenes with high visual quality. We contribute the first real and synthetic event datasets tailored for this setting. Our method demonstrates superior novel view synthesis and consistently outperforms the baseline EventNeRF by a margin of 11\u221225% in PSNR (dB) while being orders of magnitude faster in reconstruction and rendering.",

We provide exhaustive qualitative and qualitative evaluations for dense correspondences.\n   Experiments on several datasets demonstrate superior efficiency, 3D consistency, and the emergence of dense correspondences of GVP over the state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "Surface reconstruction from multiple, calibrated images is a challenging task - often requiring a large number of collected images with significant overlap. We look at the specific case of human foot reconstruction. As with previous successful foot reconstruction work, we seek to extract rich per-pixel geometry cues from multi-view RGB images, and fuse these into a final 3D object. Our method, FOCUS, tackles this problem with 3 main contributions: (i) SynFoot2, an extension of an existing synthetic foot dataset to include a new data type: dense correspondence with the parameterized foot model FIND; (ii) an uncertainty-aware dense correspondence predictor trained on our synthetic dataset; (iii) two methods for reconstructing a 3D surface from dense correspondence predictions: one inspired by Structure-from-Motion, and one optimization-based using the FIND model. We show that our reconstruction achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality in a few-view setting, performing comparably to state-of-the-art when many views are available, and runs substantially faster. We release our synthetic dataset to the research community. Code is available at: https://github.com/OllieBoyne/FOCUS",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in view synthesis and real-time rendering have achieved photorealistic quality at impressive rendering speeds. While radiance field-based methods achieve state-of-the-art quality in challenging scenarios such as in-the-wild captures and large-scale scenes, they often suffer from excessively high compute requirements linked to volumetric rendering. Gaussian Splatting-based methods, on the other hand, rely on rasterization and naturally achieve real-time rendering but suffer from brittle optimization heuristics that underperform on more challenging scenes. In this work, we present RadSplat, a lightweight method for robust real-time rendering of complex scenes. Our main contributions are threefold. First, we use radiance fields as a prior and supervision signal for optimizing point-based scene representations, leading to improved quality and more robust optimization. Next, we develop a novel pruning technique reducing the overall point count while maintaining high quality, leading to smaller and more compact scene representations with faster inference speeds. Finally, we propose a novel test-time filtering approach that further accelerates rendering and allows to scale to larger, house-sized scenes. We find that our method enables state-of-the-art synthesis of complex captures at 900+ FPS.",

        "abstract": "Freehand 3D sketches are a great medium to ideate and create visual content. However, generating 3D models from such rough sketches remains an unsolved, non-trivial task. We present a complete end-to-end interactive framework for rapid, incremental modelling from sparse, irregular 3D sketches. At the core of our solution, is 'sketchTransformer', a two-staged transformer network architecture, that fits parametric surface patches to a set of sketch strokes. We devise a novel pseudo height field representation that enables sketchTransformer to handle the noise and sparseness in the input strokes. Our method interactively evolves the surface model while maintaining smooth joins to nearby patches. We show two frontends for our framework, one on the desktop and as a mobile AR application, to illustrate how our method complements a standard 3D modelling pipelines. We can robustly handle a large variety of input 3D strokes, that competing methods cannot parse adequately.",

        "abstract": "Establishing consistent and dense correspondences across multiple images is crucial for Structure from Motion (SfM) systems. Significant view changes, such as air-to-ground with very sparse view overlap, pose an even greater challenge to the correspondence solvers. We present a novel optimization-based approach that significantly enhances existing feature matching methods by introducing geometry cues in addition to color cues. This helps fill gaps when there is less overlap in large-scale scenarios. Our method formulates geometric verification as an optimization problem, guiding feature matching within detector-free methods and using sparse correspondences from detector-based methods as anchor points. By enforcing geometric constraints via the Sampson Distance, our approach ensures that the denser correspondences from detector-free methods are geometrically consistent and more accurate. This hybrid strategy significantly improves correspondence density and accuracy, mitigates multi-view inconsistencies, and leads to notable advancements in camera pose accuracy and point cloud density. It outperforms state-of-the-art feature matching methods on benchmark datasets and enables feature matching in challenging extreme large-scale settings.",

        "abstract": "Single-view 3D reconstruction is currently approached from two dominant perspectives: reconstruction of scenes with limited diversity using 3D data supervision or reconstruction of diverse singular objects using large image priors. However, real-world scenarios are far more complex and exceed the capabilities of these methods. We therefore propose a hybrid method following a divide-and-conquer strategy. We first process the scene holistically, extracting depth and semantic information, and then leverage an object-level method for the detailed reconstruction of individual components. By splitting the problem into simpler tasks, our system is able to generalize to various types of scenes without retraining or fine-tuning. We purposely design our pipeline to be highly modular with independent, self-contained modules, to avoid the need for end-to-end training of the whole system. This enables the pipeline to naturally improve as future methods can replace the individual modules. We demonstrate the reconstruction performance of our approach on both synthetic and real-world scenes, comparing favorable against prior works. Project page: https://andreeadogaru.github.io/Gen3DSR",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for cross-view synthesis aimed at generating plausible ground-level images from corresponding satellite imagery or vice versa. We refer to these tasks as satellite-to-ground (Sat2Grd) and ground-to-satellite (Grd2Sat) synthesis, respectively. Unlike previous works that typically focus on one-to-one generation, producing a single output image from a single input image, our approach acknowledges the inherent one-to-many nature of the problem. This recognition stems from the challenges posed by differences in illumination, weather conditions, and occlusions between the two views. To effectively model this uncertainty, we leverage recent advancements in diffusion models. Specifically, we exploit random Gaussian noise to represent the diverse possibilities learnt from the target view data. Additionally, we introduce a Geometry-guided Cross-view Condition (GCC) strategy to establish explicit geometric correspondences between satellite and street-view features. This enables us to resolve the geometry ambiguity introduced by camera pose between image pairs, boosting the performance of cross-view image synthesis. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses on three benchmark cross-view datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed geometry-guided cross-view condition over baseline methods, including recent state-of-the-art approaches in cross-view image synthesis. Our method generates images of higher quality, fidelity, and diversity than other state-of-the-art approaches.",

It accurately infers shape, albedo, visibility, and sun and sky illumination from wide-baseline videos, such as those from car-mounted cameras, differing from NeRF's dense view settings. In this context, standard methods often yield subpar geometry and material estimates, such as inaccurate roof representations and numerous `floaters.' UrbanIR addresses these issues with novel losses that reduce errors in inverse graphics inference and rendering artifacts. Its techniques allow for precise shadow volume estimation in the original scene. The model's outputs support controllable editing, enabling photorealistic free-viewpoint renderings of night simulations, relit scenes, and inserted objects, marking a significant improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code and data will be made publicly available upon acceptance.",

Our method represents light- and view-dependent scattering via bidirectional spherical harmonics that does not use a specific surface normal-related reflectance function, making it more compatible with volumetric representations like Gaussian splatting, where the normals are undefined. We demonstrate our method by reconstructing and rendering objects with complex materials on synthetic and captured One-Light-At-a-Time (OLAT) datasets, showcasing various photorealistic appearances our method captures and the real-time performance.",

        "abstract": "Depth completion using lightweight time-of-flight (ToF) depth sensors is attractive due to their low cost. However, lightweight ToF sensors usually have a limited field of view (FOV) compared with cameras. Thus, only pixels in the zone area of the image can be associated with depth signals. Previous methods fail to propagate depth features from the zone area to the outside-zone area effectively, thus suffering from degraded depth completion performance outside the zone. To this end, this paper proposes the CFPNet to achieve cross-zone feature propagation from the zone area to the outside-zone area with two novel modules. The first is a direct-attention-based propagation module (DAPM), which enforces direct cross-zone feature acquisition. The second is a large-kernel-based propagation module (LKPM), which realizes cross-zone feature propagation by utilizing convolution layers with kernel sizes up to 31. CFPNet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) depth completion performance by combining these two modules properly, as verified by extensive experimental results on the ZJU-L5 dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/denyingmxd/CFPNet.",

        "abstract": "Over the past years, significant progress was made in creating photorealistic and drivable 3D avatars solely from videos of real humans.\nHowever, a core remaining challenge is the fine-grained and user-friendly editing of clothing styles by means of textual descriptions.\nIn particular, text-based edits of full-body avatars should satisfy two properties: 1) Spatio-temporal consistency, i.e. the dynamics, and the photo-real quality of the original avatar, should remain intact;  2) The final result should respect the user-specified edit. To this end, we present TEDRA the first method allowing text-based edits of an avatar, that are photorealistic, space-time coherent, dynamic, and enable skeletal pose and view control.  We leverage a pre-trained avatar that is represented as a signed distance and radiance field, which is anchored to an explicit and deformable mesh template. After a pre-training stage, we obtain a drivable and photo-real digital counterpart of the real actor. Specifically, we employ an optimization strategy to integrate various frames capturing distinct camera perspectives and the dynamics of a video performance into a unified diffusion model. Utilizing this personalized diffusion model, we modify the dynamic avatar based on a provided text prompt, introducing the Normal Aligned Identity Preserving Score Distillation Sampling (NAIP-SDS) within a model-based guidance framework. Additionally, we implement a time-step annealing strategy to ensure the high quality of our edits. Our results demonstrate a clear improvement over prior work in terms of functionality and visual quality.\nThus, our method is a clear step towards intuitive and photorealistic editability of digital avatars, which explicitly accounts for dynamics and allows skeletal pose and view control at test time.",

Recently, novel video diffusion models generate realistic videos with complex motion and enable animations of 2D images, however they cannot naively be used to animate 3D scenes as they lack multi-view consistency. To breathe life into the static world, we propose Gaussians2Life, a method for animating parts of high-quality 3D scenes in a Gaussian Splatting representation. Our key idea is to leverage powerful video diffusion models as the generative component of our model and to combine these with a robust technique to lift 2D videos into meaningful 3D motion. We find that, in contrast to prior work, this enables realistic animations of complex, pre-existing 3D scenes in a robust manner and further enables the animation of a large variety of object classes, while related work is mostly focused on prior-based character animation, or single 3D objects due to biases of video diffusion models. Our model can readily be used to create immersive and engaging 3D experiences for arbitrary scenes in a consistent manner.",

        "abstract": "Tracking human object interaction from videos is important to understand human behavior from the rapidly growing stream of video data. Previous video-based methods require predefined object templates while single-image-based methods are template-free but lack temporal consistency. In this paper, we present a method to track human object interaction without any object shape templates. We decompose the 4D tracking problem into per-frame pose tracking and canonical shape optimization. We first apply a single-view reconstruction method to obtain temporally-inconsistent per-frame interaction reconstructions. \nThen, for the human, we propose an efficient autoencoder to predict SMPL vertices directly from the per-frame reconstructions, introducing temporally consistent correspondence. \nFor the object, we introduce a pose estimator that leverages temporal information to predict smooth object rotations under occlusions. To train our model, we propose a method to generate synthetic interaction videos and synthesize in total 10 hour videos of 8.3k sequences with full 3D ground truth. Experiments on BEHAVE and InterCap show that our method significantly outperforms previous template-based video tracking and single-frame reconstruction methods. Our proposed synthetic video dataset also allows training video-based methods that generalize to real-world videos. Our code and dataset are publicly released.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic neural radiance fields (dynamic NeRFs) have achieved remarkable successes in synthesizing novel views for 3D dynamic scenes. Traditional approaches typically necessitate full video sequences for the training phase prior to the synthesis of new views, akin to replaying a recording of a dynamic 3D event. In contrast, on-the-fly training allows for the immediate processing and rendering of dynamic scenes without the need for pre-training on full sequences, offering a more flexible and time-efficient solution for dynamic scene rendering tasks.In this paper, we propose a highly efficient on-the-fly training algorithm for dynamic NeRFs, named OD-NeRF. To accelerate the training process, our method minimizes the training required for the model at each frame by using: 1) a NeRF model conditioned on multi-view projected colors, which exhibits superior generalization across multiple frames with minimal training ,and 2) a transition and update algorithm that leverages the occupancy grid from the last frame to sample efficiently at the current frame. Our algorithm can achieve an interactive training speed of 10FPS on synthetic dynamic scenes on-the-fly, and a 3$\\times$-9$\\times$ training speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art on-the-fly NeRF on real-world dynamic scenes.",

        "abstract": "Due to their performance and simplicity, rigid body simulators are often used in applications where the objects of interest can considered very stiff. However, no material has infinite stiffness, which means there are potentially cases where the non-zero compliance of the seemingly rigid object can cause a significant difference between its trajectories when simulated in a rigid body or deformable simulator. \n\nSimilarly to how adversarial attacks are developed against image classifiers, we propose an adversarial attack against rigid body simulators. In this adversarial attack, we solve an optimization problem to construct perceptually rigid adversarial objects that have the same collision geometry and moments of mass to a reference object, so that they behave identically in rigid body simulations but maximally different in more accurate deformable simulations. We demonstrate the validity of our method by comparing simulations of several examples in commercially available simulators.",

However, existing methods cannot faithfully capture the scene layout based on text descriptions, nor do they allow flexible editing of individual objects in the room.\nTo address these problems, we present Ctrl-Room, which can generate convincing 3D rooms with designer-style layouts and high-fidelity textures from just a text prompt. Our key insight is to separate the modeling of layouts and appearance.\nOur proposed method consists of two stages: a Layout Generation Stage and an Appearance Generation Stage. The Layout Generation Stage trains a text-conditional diffusion model to learn the layout distribution with our holistic scene code parameterization. Next, the Appearance Generation Stage employs a fine-tuned ControlNet to produce a vivid panoramic image of the room guided by the 3D scene layout, then further upgrades to a panoramic NeRF model. \nBenefiting from the scene code parameterization, we can easily edit the generated room model through our mask-guided editing module, without expensive edit-specific training. Extensive experiments on the Structured3D dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in producing more reasonable, view-consistent, and editable 3D rooms from text prompts.",

        "abstract": "We introduce GaussianAvatar-Editor, an innovative framework for text-driven editing of animatable Gaussian head avatars that can be fully controlled in expression, pose, and viewpoint. Unlike static 3D Gaussian editing, editing animatable 4D Gaussian avatars presents challenges related to motion occlusion and spatial-temporal inconsistency. To address these issues, we propose the Weighted Alpha Blending Equation (WABE). This function enhances the blending weight of visible Gaussians while suppressing the influence on non-visible Gaussians, effectively handling motion occlusion during editing. Furthermore, to improve editing quality and ensure 4D consistency, we incorporate conditional adversarial learning into the editing process. This strategy helps to refine the edited results and maintain consistency throughout the animation. By integrating these methods, our GaussianAvatar-Editor achieves photorealistic and consistent results in animatable 4D Gaussian editing. We conduct comprehensive experiments across various subjects to validate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques, which demonstrates the superiority of our approach over existing methods.

        "tldr": "",
        "abstract": "Synthesizing 3D whole bodies that realistically grasp objects is useful for animation, mixed reality, and robotics. This is challenging, because the hands and body need to look natural w.r.t. each other, the grasped object, as well as the local scene (i.e., a receptacle supporting the object). Moreover, training data for this task is really scarce, while capturing new data is expensive. Recent work goes beyond finite datasets via a divide-and-conquer approach; it first generates a \u201cguiding\u201d right-hand grasp, and then searches for bodies that match this. However, the guiding-hand synthesis lacks controllability and receptacle awareness, so it likely has an implausible direction (i.e., a body can\u2019t match this without penetrating the receptacle) and needs corrections through major post-processing. Moreover, the body search needs exhaustive sampling and is expensive. These are strong limitations. We tackle these with a novel method called CWGrasp. Our key idea is that performing geometry-based reasoning \u201cearly on,\u201d instead of \u201ctoo late,\u201d provides rich \u201ccontrol\u201d signals for inference. To this end, CWGrasp first samples a plausible reaching-direction vector (used later for both the arm and hand) from a probabilistic model built via ray-casting from the object and collision checking. Then, it generates a reaching body with a desired arm direction, as well as a \u201cguiding\u201d grasping hand with a desired palm direction that complies with the arm\u2019s one. Eventually, CWGrasp refines the body to match the \u201cguiding\u201d hand, while plausibly contacting the scene. Notably, generating already-compatible \u201cparts\u201d greatly simplifies the \u201cwhole\u201d. Moreover, CWGrasp uniquely tackles both right and left-hand grasps. We evaluate on the GRAB and ReplicaGrasp datasets. CWGrasp outperforms baselines, at lower runtime and budget, while all components help performance.

        "abstract": "We present a method to reconstruct time-consistent human body models from monocular videos, focusing on extremely loose clothing or handheld object interactions. Prior work in human reconstruction is either limited to tight-fitting clothing with no object interactions, or requires calibrated multi-view captures or personalized template scans which are costly to collect at scale. Our key insight for high-quality yet flexible reconstruction is the careful combination of generic human priors about articulated body shape (learned from large-scale training data) with video-specific articulated \"bag-of-bones\" deformation (fit to a single video via test-time optimization). We accomplish this by learning a neural implicit model that disentangles body versus clothing deformations as separate motion model layers. To capture subtle geometry of clothing, we leverage image-based priors such as human body pose, surface normals, and optical flow during optimization. The resulting neural fields can be extracted into time-consistent meshes, or further refined as explicit 3D gaussians for high-fidelity interactive rendering. On datasets with highly challenging clothing deformations and object interactions, DressRecon yields higher-fidelity 3D reconstructions than prior art.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of reconstructing a scene online at the level of objects given an RGB-D video sequence.  While current object-aware neural implicit representations hold promise, they are limited in online reconstruction efficiency and shape completion. Our main contributions to alleviate the above limitations are twofold. First, we propose a feature grid interpolation mechanism to continuously update grid-based object-centric neural implicit representations as new object parts are revealed. Second, we construct an object library with previously mapped objects in advance and leverage the corresponding shape priors to initialize geometric object models in new videos, subsequently completing them with novel views as well as synthesized past views to avoid losing original object details. Extensive experiments on synthetic environments from the Replica dataset, real-world ScanNet sequences and videos captured in our laboratory demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art neural implicit models for this task in terms of reconstruction accuracy and completeness.",

        "abstract": "Modern visual effects (VFX) software has made it possible for skilled artists to create imagery of virtually anything. However, the creation process remains laborious, complex, and largely inaccessible to everyday users. In this work, we present AutoVFX, a framework that automatically creates realistic and dynamic VFX videos from a single video and natural language instructions. By carefully integrating neural scene modeling, LLM-based code generation, and physical simulation, AutoVFX is able to provide physically-grounded, photorealistic editing effects that can be controlled directly using natural language instructions. We conduct extensive experiments to validate AutoVFX's efficacy across a diverse spectrum of videos and instructions. Quantitative and qualitative results suggest that AutoVFX outperforms all competing methods by a large margin in generative quality, instruction alignment, editing versatility, and physical plausibility.",

        "abstract": "With the attention gained by camera-only 3D object detection in autonomous driving, methods based on Bird-Eye-View (BEV) representation especially derived from the forward view transformation paradigm, i.e., lift-splat-shoot (LSS), have recently seen significant progress. The BEV representation formulated by the frustum based on depth distribution prediction is ideal for learning the road structure and scene layout from multi-view images. However, to retain computational efficiency, the compressed BEV representation such as in resolution and axis is inevitably weak in retaining the individual geometric details, undermining the methodological generality and applicability. With this in mind, to compensate for the missing details and utilize multi-view geometry constraints, we propose LSSInst, a two-stage object detector incorporating BEV and instance representations in tandem. The proposed detector exploits fine-grained pixel-level features that can be flexibly integrated into existing LSS-based BEV networks. Having said that, due to the inherent gap between two representation spaces, we design the instance adaptor for the BEV-to-instance semantic coherence rather than pass the proposal naively. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed framework is of excellent generalization ability and performance, which boosts the performances of modern LSS-based BEV perception methods without bells and whistles and outperforms current LSS-based state-of-the-art works on the large-scale nuScenes benchmark.",

        "abstract": "Building a foundation model for 3D vision is a complex challenge that remains unsolved. Towards that goal, it is important to understand the 3D reasoning capabilities of current models as well as identify the gaps between these models and humans. Therefore, we construct a new 3D visual understanding benchmark named UniQA-3D. UniQA-3D covers fundamental 3D vision tasks in the Visual Question Answering (VQA) format. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs), specialized models, and human subjects on it. Our results show that VLMs generally perform poorly, while the specialized models are accurate but not robust, failing under geometric perturbations. In contrast, human vision continues to be the most reliable 3D visual system. We further demonstrate that neural networks align more closely with human 3D vision mechanisms compared to classical computer vision methods, and Transformer-based networks such as ViT align more closely with human 3D vision mechanisms than CNNs. We hope our study will benefit the future development of foundation models for 3D vision. Code is available at https://github.com/princeton-vl/UniQA-3D.",

        "abstract": "Implicit neural representations (INRs) have become an important method for encoding various data types, such as 3D objects or scenes, images, and videos. They have proven to be particularly effective at representing 3D content, e.g., 3D scene reconstruction from 2D images, novel 3D content creation, as well as the representation, interpolation, and completion of 3D shapes. With the widespread generation of 3D data in an INR format, there is a need to support effective organization and retrieval of INRs saved in a data store. A key aspect of retrieval and clustering of INRs in a data store is the formulation of similarity between INRs that would, for example, enable retrieval of similar INRs using a query INR. In this work, we propose INRet, a method for determining similarity between INRs that represent shapes, thus enabling accurate retrieval of similar shape INRs from an INR data store. INRet flexibly supports different INR architectures such as INRs with octree grids, triplanes, and hash grids, as well as different implicit functions including signed/unsigned distance function and occupancy field. We demonstrate that our method is more general and accurate than the existing INR retrieval method, which only supports simple MLP INRs and requires the same architecture between the query and stored INRs. Furthermore, compared to converting INRs to other representations (e.g., point clouds or multi-view images) for 3D shape retrieval, INRet achieves higher accuracy while avoiding the conversion overhead.",

        "abstract": "Test-Time Training (TTT) proposes to adapt a pre-trained network to changing data distributions on-the-fly. In this work, we propose the first TTT method for 3D semantic segmentation, TTT-KD, which models Knowledge Distillation (KD) from foundation models (e.g. DINOv2) as a self-supervised objective for adaptation to distribution shifts at test-time. Given access to paired image-pointcloud (2D-3D) data, we first optimize a 3D segmentation backbone for the main task of semantic segmentation using the pointclouds and the task of 2D \u2192 3D KD by using an off-the-shelf 2D pre-trained foundation model. At test-time, our TTT-KD updates the 3D segmentation backbone for each test sample, by using the self-supervised task of knowledge distillation, before performing the final prediction. Extensive evaluations on multiple indoor and outdoor 3D segmentation benchmarks show the utility of TTT-KD, as it improves performance for both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) test datasets. We achieve a gain of up to 13 % mIoU (7 % on average) when the train and test distributions are similar and up to 45 % (20 % on average) when adapting to OOD test samples",

        "abstract": "To evaluate end-to-end autonomous driving systems, a simulation environment based on Novel View Synthesis (NVS) techniques is essential, which synthesizes photo-realistic images and point clouds from previously recorded sequences under new vehicle poses, particularly in cross-lane scenarios. Therefore, the development of a multi-lane dataset and benchmark is necessary. While recent synthetic scene-based NVS datasets have been prepared for cross-lane benchmarking, they still lack the realism of captured images and point clouds. To further assess the performance of existing methods based on NeRF and 3DGS, we present the first multi-lane dataset registering parallel scans specifically for novel driving view synthesis dataset derived from real-world scans, comprising 25 groups of associated sequences, including 16,000 front-view images, 64,000 surround-view images, and 16,000 LiDAR frames. All frames are labeled to differentiate moving objects from static elements. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of existing approaches in various testing scenarios at different lanes and distances. Additionally, our method provides the solution for solving and assessing the quality of multi-sensor poses for multi-modal data alignment for curating such a dataset in real-world. We plan to continually add new sequences to test the generalization of existing methods across different scenarios.

Built on the DUSt3R paradigm, Spann3R uses a transformer-based architecture to directly regress a global pointmap from images without any prior knowledge of the scene or camera parameters. Unlike DUSt3R, which predicts per image-pair pointmaps each expressed in its local coordinate frame, Spann3R can predict a per-image pointmaps expressed in a global coordinate system, thus eliminating the need for optimization-based global alignment. The key idea of Spann3R is to manage an external spatial memory that learns to keep track of all previous relevant 3D information. Spann3R then queries this spatial memory to predict the 3D structure of the next frame in a global coordinate system. Taking advantage of DUSt3R's pre-trained weights, and further fine-tuning on a subset of datasets, Spann3R shows competitive performance and generalization ability on various unseen datasets and is able to process ordered image collections in real-time.",

        "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time rendering of unbounded 3D scenes for novel view synthesis. However, this technique requires dense training views to accurately reconstruct 3D geometry. A limited number of input views will significantly degrade reconstruction quality, resulting in artifacts such as \"floaters'' and \"background collapse'' at unseen viewpoints.  In this work, we introduce SparseGS, an efficient training pipeline designed to address the limitations of 3DGS in scenarios with sparse training views. SparseGS incorporates depth priors, novel depth rendering techniques, and a pruning heuristic to mitigate floater artifacts, alongside an Unseen Viewpoint Regularization module to alleviate background collapses. Our extensive evaluations on the Mip-NeRF360, LLFF, and DTU datasets demonstrate that SparseGS achieves high-quality reconstruction in both unbounded and forward-facing scenarios, with as few as 12 and 3 input images, respectively, while maintaining fast training and real-time rendering capabilities.",

        "abstract": "We introduce Spurfies, a novel method for sparse-view surface reconstruction that disentangles appearance and geometry information to utilize local geometry priors trained on synthetic data. Recent research heavily focuses on 3D reconstruction using dense multi-view setups, typically requiring hundreds of images. However, these methods often struggle with few-view scenarios. Existing sparse-view reconstruction techniques often rely on multi-view stereo networks that need to learn joint priors for geometry and appearance from a large amount of data. In contrast, we introduce a neural point representation that disentangles geometry and appearance to train a local geometry prior using a subset of the synthetic ShapeNet dataset only. During inference, we utilize this surface prior as additional constraint for surface and appearance reconstruction from sparse input views via differentiable volume rendering, restricting the space of possible solutions. We validate the effectiveness of our method on the DTU dataset and demonstrate that it outperforms previous work by 35\\% in surface quality while achieving competitive novel view synthesis quality. Moreover, in contrast to previous works, our method can be applied to larger, unbounded scenes, such as Mip-NeRF360.",

        "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted great attention in novel view synthesis because of its superior rendering efficiency and high fidelity. However, the trained Gaussians suffer from severe zooming degradation due to non-adjustable representation derived from single-scale training. Though some methods attempt to tackle this problem via post-processing techniques such as selective rendering or filtering techniques towards primitives, the scale-specific information is not involved in Gaussians. In this paper, we propose a unified optimization method to make Gaussians adaptive for arbitrary scales by self-adjusting the primitive properties (e.g., color, shape and size) and distribution (e.g., position). Inspired by the mipmap technique, we design pseudo ground-truth for the target scale and propose a scale-consistency guidance loss to inject scale information into 3D Gaussians. Our method is a plug-in module, applicable for any 3DGS models to solve the zoom-in and zoom-out aliasing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, our method outperforms 3DGS in PSNR by an average of 9.25 dB for zoom-in and 10.40 dB for zoom-out on the NeRF Synthetic dataset.",

        "abstract": "Cross-modal place recognition methods are flexible GPS-alternatives under varying environment conditions and sensor setups. However, this task is non-trivial since extracting consistent and robust global descriptors from different modalities is challenging. To tackle this issue, we propose \\textit{Voxel-Cross-Pixel (VXP)}, a novel camera-to-LiDAR place recognition framework that enforces local similarities in a self-supervised manner and effectively brings global context from images and LiDAR scans into a shared feature space. Specifically, VXP is trained in three stages: first, we deploy a visual transformer to compactly represent input images. Secondly, we establish local correspondences between image-based and point cloud-based feature spaces using our novel geometric alignment module. We then aggregate local similarities into an expressive shared latent space. Extensive experiments on the three benchmarks (Oxford RobotCar, ViViD++ and KITTI) demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval by a large margin. Our evaluations show that the proposed method is accurate, efficient and light-weight.

        "abstract": "We present Rig3DGS, a novel technique for creating reanimatable 3D portraits from short monocular smartphone videos. Rig3DGS learns to reconstruct a set of controllable 3D gaussians from a monocular video of a dynamic subject captured with varying head poses and facial expressions in an in-the-wild scene. In contrast to synchronized multi-view studio captures, this in-the-wild, single camera setup brings fresh challenges to learning high quality 3D gaussians. We address these challenges by learning to deform 3D gaussians from a fixed canonical space to the deformed space that is consistent with the target facial expression and head-pose. Our key contribution is a carefully designed deformation model that is guided by a 3D face morphable model.  This deformation not only enables control over facial expression and head-poses but also allows our method to generates high quality photorealistic renders of the whole scene. Once trained, Rig3DGS is able to generate photorealistic renders of a subject and their scene for novel facial expression, head-poses, and viewing directions.  Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that Rig3DGS significantly outperforms prior art while being orders of magnitude faster.",

        "abstract": "Traditional 3D garment creation is labor-intensive, involving sketching, modeling, UV mapping, and texturing, which are time-consuming and costly. Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have enabled new possibilities for 3D garment generation from text prompts, images, and videos. However, existing methods either suffer from inconsistencies among multi-view images or require additional processes to separate cloth from the underlying human model. In this paper, we propose GarmentDreamer, a novel method that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as guidance to generate wearable, simulation-ready 3D garment meshes from text prompts. In contrast to using multi-view images directly predicted by generative models as guidance, our 3DGS guidance ensures consistent optimization in both garment deformation and texture synthesis. Our method introduces a novel garment augmentation module, guided by normal and RGBA information, and employs implicit Neural Texture Fields (NeTF) combined with Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to generate diverse geometric and texture details. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, showcasing the superior performance of GarmentDreamer over state-of-the-art alternatives.",

        "tldr": "",
        "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has recently attracted great attention with real-time and photo-realistic renderings. This technique typically takes perspective images as input and optimizes a set of 3D elliptical Gaussians by splatting them onto the image planes, resulting in 2D Gaussians. However, applying 3D-GS to panoramic inputs presents challenges in effectively modeling the projection onto the spherical surface of ${360^\\circ}$ images using 2D Gaussians. In practical applications, input panoramas are often sparse, leading to unreliable initialization of 3D Gaussians and subsequent degradation of 3D-GS quality. In addition, due to the under-constrained geometry of texture-less planes (e.g., walls and floors), 3D-GS struggles to model these flat regions with elliptical Gaussians, resulting in significant floaters in novel views. To address these issues, we propose 360-GS, a novel layout-guided $360^{\\circ}$ Gaussian splatting for a limited set of panoramic inputs. Instead of splatting 3D Gaussians directly onto the spherical surface, 360-GS projects them onto the tangent plane of the unit sphere and then maps them to the spherical projections. This adaptation enables the representation of the projection using Gaussians. We guide the optimization of 3D Gaussians by exploiting layout priors within panoramas, which are simple to obtain and contain strong structural information about the indoor scene. Our experimental results demonstrate that 360-GS allows panoramic rendering and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with fewer artifacts in novel view synthesis, thus providing immersive roaming in indoor scenarios.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces FlowMap, an end-to-end differentiable method that solves for precise camera poses, camera intrinsics, and per-frame dense depth of a video sequence. Our method performs per-video gradient-descent minimization of a simple least-squares objective that compares the optical flow induced by depth, intrinsics, and poses against correspondences obtained via off-the-shelf optical flow and point tracking. Alongside the use of point tracks to encourage long-term geometric consistency, we introduce a differentiable re-parameterization of depth, intrinsics, and pose that is amenable to first-order optimization. We empirically show that camera parameters and dense depth recovered by our method enable photo-realistic novel view synthesis on 360\u00b0 trajectories using Gaussian Splatting. Our method not only far outperforms prior gradient-descent based bundle adjustment methods, but surprisingly performs on par with COLMAP, the state-of-the-art SfM method, on the downstream task of 360\u00b0 novel view synthesis - even though our method is purely gradient-descent based, fully differentiable, and presents a complete departure from conventional SfM. Our result opens the door to the self-supervised training of neural networks that perform camera parameter estimation, 3D reconstruction, and novel view synthesis.",

Our approach differs from existing state-of-the-art methods that are either: (i) object-agnostic, but can only operate on individual frames, or (ii) can model space-time dependencies, but are only designed to work with a single object category. Our approach is grounded in two core principles. First, general information about similar objects can be leveraged to achieve better performance when there is little object-specific training data. Second, a temporally-proximate context window is advantageous for achieving consistency throughout a sequence. These two principles allow us to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on per-frame and per-sequence metrics for a variety of animal categories. Lastly, we release a new synthetic dataset containing 3D skeletons and motion sequences for a variety of animal categories.",

        "abstract": "Point clouds are a set of data points in space to represent the 3D geometry of objects. A fundamental step in the processing is to identify a subset of points to represent the shape. While traditional sampling methods often ignore to incorporate geometrical information, recent developments in learning-based sampling models have achieved significant levels of performance. With the integration of geometrical priors, the ability to learn and preserve the underlying structure can be enhanced when sampling. To shed light into the shape, a qualitative skeleton serves as an effective descriptor to guide sampling for both local and global geometries. In this paper, we introduce MorphoSkel3D as a new technique based on morphology to facilitate an efficient skeletonization of shapes. With its low computational cost, MorphoSkel3D is a unique, rule-based algorithm to benchmark its quality and performance on two large datasets, ModelNet and ShapeNet, under different sampling ratios. The results show that training with MorphoSkel3D leads to an informed and more accurate sampling in the practical application of object classification and point cloud retrieval.",

        "abstract": "The latest regularized Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) approaches produce poor geometry and view extrapolation for large scale sparse view scenes, such as ETH3D. Density-based approaches tend to be under-constrained, while surface-based approaches tend to miss details. In this paper, we take a density-based approach, sampling patches instead of individual rays to better incorporate monocular depth and normal estimates and patch-based photometric consistency constraints between training views and sampled virtual views. Loosely constraining densities based on estimated depth aligned to sparse points further improves geometric accuracy.  While maintaining similar view synthesis quality, our approach significantly improves geometric accuracy on the ETH3D benchmark, e.g. increasing the F1@2cm score by 4x-8x compared to other regularized density-based approaches, with much lower training and inference time than other approaches.",

This method allows us to use image generation models, such as Diffusion Transformers, directly for 3D shape generation.

Our approach is based on a generalized eigenvalue problem, where the formulation contains edge weights in relative directions and vertex weights in absolute image translations. We present a rigorous stability analysis to determine how to set these weights optimally. Specifically, optimal vertex weights are always $1$, while optimal edge weights depend on magnitudes of relative transformations and variances of relative directions. These results lead to an iterative translation synchronization formulation, which progressively removes outliers in the inputs by adaptively adjusting the edge weights. We present exact and robust recovery conditions for our approach under a standard noise model. Experimental results justify our theoretical results and show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baseline approaches on both synthetic and real datasets.",

Given the 3D point cloud and multiple posed RGB-D frames of 3D scenes, our approach segments 3D instances by applying the pretrained Segment Anything Model (SAM) to 2D frames. Our key idea involves locating SAM prompts in 3D to align their projected pixel prompts across frames, ensuring the view consistency of SAM-predicted masks. Moreover, we suggest selecting prompts from the initial set guided by the information of SAM-predicted masks across all views, which enhances the overall performance. We further propose to consolidate different prompts if they are segmenting different surface parts of the same 3D instance, bringing a more comprehensive segmentation. Notably, our method does **not** require any additional training. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show that our method achieves comparable or better performance compared to previous zero-shot or fully supervised approaches, and in many cases surpasses human annotations. Furthermore, since our fine-grained predictions often lack annotations in available datasets, we present ScanNet200-Fine50 test data which provides more fine-grained annotations on 50 scenes from ScanNet200 dataset.",

To address blur artifacts, we leverage both (blurry) RGB images and event camera data captured in a binocular configuration. Importantly, when reconstructing our clear NeRF, we consider the camera modeling imperfections that arise from the simple pinhole camera model as learned embeddings for each camera measurement, and further learn a mapper that connects event camera measurements with RGB data. As no previous dataset exists for our binocular setting, we introduce an event camera dataset with captures from a 3D-printed stereo configuration between RGB and event cameras. Empirically, we evaluate on our introduced dataset and EVIMOv2 and show that our method leads to improved reconstructions. We are committed to making our code and dataset public.",

        "abstract": "Learning-based methods address its inherent scale ambiguity by leveraging increasingly large labeled and unlabeled datasets, to produce geometric priors capable of generating accurate predictions across domains. As a result, state of the art approaches show impressive performance in zero-shot relative and metric depth estimation. Recently, diffusion models have exhibited remarkable scalability and generalizable properties in their learned representations. However, because these models repurpose tools originally designed for image generation, they can only operate on dense ground-truth, which is not available for most depth labels, especially in real-world settings. In this paper we present GRIN, an efficient diffusion model designed to ingest sparse unstructured training data. We use image features with 3D geometric positional encodings to condition the diffusion process both globally and locally, generating depth predictions at a pixel-level. With comprehensive experiments across eight indoor and outdoor datasets, we show that GRIN establishes a new state of the art in zero-shot metric monocular depth estimation even when trained from scratch.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel framework for compactly representing a 3D indoor scene using a set of polycuboids through a deep learning-based fitting method. Indoor scenes mainly consist of man-made objects, such as furniture, which often exhibit rectilinear geometry. This property allows indoor scenes to be represented using combinations of polycuboids, providing a compact representation that benefits downstream applications like furniture rearrangement. Our framework takes a noisy point cloud as input and first detects six types of cuboid faces using a transformer network. Then, a graph neural network is used to validate the spatial relationships of the detected faces to form potential polycuboids. Finally, each polycuboid instance is reconstructed by forming a set of boxes based on the aggregated face labels. To train our networks, we introduce a synthetic dataset encompassing a diverse range of cuboid and polycuboid shapes that reflect the characteristics of indoor scenes. Our framework generalizes well to real-world indoor scene datasets, including Replica, ScanNet, and scenes captured with an iPhone. The versatility of our method is demonstrated through practical applications, such as virtual room tours and scene editing.",

        "abstract": "We present iFusion, a novel 3D object reconstruction framework that requires only two views with unknown camera poses.\nWhile single-view reconstruction yields visually appealing results, it can deviate significantly from the actual object, especially on unseen sides. Additional views improve reconstruction fidelity but necessitate known camera poses. However, assuming the availability of pose may be unrealistic, and existing pose estimators fail in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we harness a pre-trained novel view synthesis diffusion model, which embeds implicit knowledge about the geometry and appearance of diverse objects. Our strategy unfolds in three steps: (1) We invert the diffusion model for camera pose estimation instead of synthesizing novel views. (2) The diffusion model is fine-tuned using provided views and estimated poses, turned into a novel view synthesizer tailored for the target object. (3) Leveraging registered views and the fine-tuned diffusion model, we reconstruct the 3D object. Experiments demonstrate strong performance in both pose estimation and novel view synthesis. Moreover, iFusion seamlessly integrates with various reconstruction methods and enhances them.",

        "abstract": "Synthesizing accurate geometry and photo-realistic appearance of small scenes is an active area of research with compelling use cases in gaming, virtual reality, robotic-manipulation, autonomous driving, convenient product capture, and consumer-level photography. When applying scene geometry and appearance estimation techniques to robotics, we found that the narrow cone of possible viewpoints due to the limited range of robot motion and scene clutter caused current estimation techniques to produce poor quality estimates or even fail. On the other hand, in robotic applications, dense metric depth can often be measured directly using stereo and illumination can be controlled. Depth can provide a good initial estimate of the object geometry to improve reconstruction, while multi-illumination images can facilitate relighting. In this work we demonstrate a method to incorporate dense metric depth into the training of neural 3D representations and address an artifact observed while jointly refining geometry and appearance by disambiguating between texture and geometry edges. We also discuss a multi-flash stereo camera system developed in-house to capture the necessary data for our pipeline and show results on relighting and view synthesis with a few training views.",

Using a Manhattan World assumption, our method leverages the per-pixel geometric priors encoded in single-image surface normal predictions and performs optimisation over the SO(3) manifold.\nGiven a sequence of images, we can use the per-frame rotation estimates and their uncertainty to perform multi-frame optimisation, achieving robustness and temporal consistency.\nOur experiments demonstrate that U-ARE-ME performs comparably to RGB-D methods and is more robust than feature-based vanishing point and SLAM methods.",

        "abstract": "Effectively modeling the interaction between human hands and objects is challenging due to the complex physical constraints and the equirement for high generation efficiency in applications. Prior approaches often employ computationally intensive two-stage approaches, which first generate an intermediate representation, such as contact maps, followed by an iterative optimization procedure that updates hand meshes to capture the hand-object relation. However, due to the high computation complexity during the optimization stage, such strategies often suffer from low efficiency in inference. To address this limitation, this work introduces a novel diffusion-model-based approach that generates the grasping pose in a one-stage manner. This allows us to significantly improve generation speed and the diversity of generated hand poses. In particular, we develop a Latent Diffusion Model with an Adaptation Module for object-conditioned hand pose generation and a contact-aware loss to enforce the physical constraints between hands and objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves faster inference, higher diversity, and superior pose quality than state-of-the-art approaches.

        "abstract": "Owing to the distinctive attributes inherent to mmWave radar, the utilization of millimeter-wave (mmWave) point cloud data in contexts involving human-related scenarios is poised to yield significant promise. However, the generation of dense and temporally consistent 3D human point clouds from sequential mmWave signals is a challenging task, yet a critical endeavor with far-reaching implications. In this work, we present a groundbreaking approach to address the challenge of generating dense and temporally consistent 3D human point clouds from sequential mmWave signals. We redefine the problem as a 3D point cloud denoising task, leveraging reverse diffusion processes to transform sparse mmWave data into detailed human representations. Our proposed method, mmDiffusion, effectively exploits diffusion models and temporal context within mmWave sequences to learn the denoising process, resulting in denser and temporally coherent human point clouds. We also introduce a novel evaluation metric tailored to measure temporal consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that mmDiffusion outperforms existing methods. Code and dataset will be public upon acceptance.",

        "abstract": "Visual localization involves estimating the 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) camera pose within a known scene. A critical step in this process is identifying pixel-to-point correspondences between 2D query images and 3D models. Most advanced approaches currently rely on extensive visual descriptors to establish these correspondences, facing challenges in storage, privacy issues and model maintenance. Direct 2D-3D keypoint matching without visual descriptors is becoming popular as it can overcome those challenges. However, existing descriptor-free methods suffer from low accuracy or heavy computation. Addressing this gap, this paper introduces the Angle-Annular Graph Neural Network (A2-GNN), a simple approach that efficiently learns robust geometric structural representations with annular feature extraction. Specifically, this approach clusters neighbors and embeds each group\u2019s distance information and angle as supplementary information to capture local structures. Evaluation on matching and visual localization datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with low computational overhead among visual description-free methods.",

        "abstract": "Interactions between human and objects are influenced not only by the object's pose and shape, but also by physical attributes such as object mass and surface friction. They introduce important motion nuances that are essential for diversity and realism. Despite advancements in recent human-object interaction methods, this aspect has been overlooked.\nGenerating nuanced human motion presents two challenges. First, it is non-trivial to learn from multi-modal human and object information derived from both the physical and non-physical attributes. Second, there exists no dataset capturing nuanced human interactions with objects of varying physical properties, hampering model development.\nThis work addresses the gap by introducing the FORCE model, an approach for synthesizing diverse, nuanced human-object interactions by modeling physical attributes. Our key insight is that human motion is dictated by the interrelation between the force exerted by the human and the perceived resistance. Guided by a novel intuitive physics encoding, the model captures the interplay between human force and resistance. Experiments also demonstrate incorporating human force facilitates learning multi-class motion.\nAccompanying our model, we contribute the a dataset, which features diverse, different-styled motion through interactions with varying resistances. Our code, dataset, and models will be released to foster future research.",

        "abstract": "The rapid growth of AR/VR/MR applications and cloud-based visual localization has heightened concerns over user privacy. \nThis privacy concern has been further escalated by the ability of deep neural networks to recover detailed images of a scene from a sparse set of 3D or 2D points and their descriptors -  the so-called inversion attacks.\nResearch on privacy-preserving localization has therefore focused on preventing such attacks through geometry obfuscation techniques like lifting points to higher dimensions or swapping coordinates. \nIn this paper, we reveal a common vulnerability in these methods that allows approximate point recovery using known neighborhoods.\nWe further show that these neighborhoods can be computed by learning to identify descriptors that co-occur in neighborhoods.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that all existing geometric obfuscation schemes remain susceptible to such recovery, challenging their claims of being privacy-preserving.",

        "abstract": "The underwater 3D scene reconstruction is a challenging, yet interesting problem with applications ranging from naval robots to VR experiences. The problem was successfully tackled by fully volumetric NeRF-based methods which can model both the geometry and the medium (water). Unfortunately, these methods are slow to train and do not offer real-time rendering. More recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) method offered a fast alternative to NeRFs. However, because it is an explicit method that renders only the geometry, it cannot render the medium and is therefore unsuited for underwater reconstruction. Therefore, we propose a novel approach that fuses volumetric rendering with 3DGS to handle underwater data effectively. Our method employs 3DGS for explicit geometry representation and a separate volumetric field (queried once per pixel) for capturing the scattering medium. This dual representation further allows the restoration of the scenes by removing the scattering medium. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods in rendering quality on the underwater SeaThru-NeRF dataset. Furthermore, it does so while offering real-time rendering performance, addressing the efficiency limitations of existing methods.",

Given the underconstrained nature of this problem, incorporating prior knowledge is essential. Therefore, we propose a framework comprising prior learning and avatar creation phases. The prior learning phase leverages 3D head priors derived from a large-scale multi-view dynamic dataset, and the avatar creation phase applies these priors for few-shot personalization. Our approach effectively captures these priors by utilizing a Gaussian Splatting-based auto-decoder network with part-based dynamic modeling. Our method employs identity-shared encoding with personalized latent codes for individual identities to learn the attributes of Gaussian primitives. During the avatar creation phase, we achieve fast head avatar personalization by leveraging inversion and fine-tuning strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model effectively exploits head priors and successfully generalizes them to few-shot personalization, achieving photo-realistic rendering quality, multi-view consistency, and stable animation.",

        "tldr": "",
        "abstract": "Inverse rendering aims to reconstruct the 3D geometry, bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) parameters, and lighting conditions in a 3D scene from multi-view input images. To address this problem, some recent methods utilize a neural field combined with a physically based rendering model to reconstruct the scene parameters. Although these methods achieve impressive geometry reconstruction for glossy objects, the performance of material estimation and relighting remains limited. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end relightable neural inverse rendering system that achieves high-quality reconstruction of geometry and material properties, thus enabling high-quality relighting. The cornerstone of our method is a two-stage approach for learning a better factorization of scene parameters. In the first stage, we develop a reflection-aware radiance field using a neural signed distance field (SDF) as the geometry representation and deploy an MLP (multilayer perceptron) to estimate indirect illumination. In the second stage, we introduce a novel information-sharing network structure to jointly learn the radiance field and the physically based factorization of the scene. For the physically based factorization, to reduce the noise caused by Monte Carlo sampling, we apply a split-sum approximation with a simplified Disney BRDF and cube mipmap as the environment light representation. In the relighting phase, to enhance the quality of indirect illumination, we propose a second split-sum algorithm to trace secondary rays under the split-sum rendering framework. Furthermore, there is no dataset or protocol available to quantitatively evaluate the inverse rendering performance for glossy objects. To assess the quality of material reconstruction and relighting, we have created a new dataset with ground truth BRDF parameters and relighting results. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in inverse rendering and relighting, with particularly strong results in the reconstruction of highly reflective objects.",

        "abstract": "Recent works in inverse rendering have shown promise in using multi-view images of an object to recover shape, albedo, and materials. However, the recovered components often fail to render accurately under new lighting conditions due to the intrinsic challenge of disentangling albedo and material properties from input images. To address this challenge, we introduce MaterialFusion, an enhanced conventional 3D inverse rendering pipeline that incorporates a 2D prior on texture and material properties. We present StableMaterial, a 2D diffusion model prior that refines multi-lit data to estimate the most likely albedo and material from given input appearances. This model is trained on albedo, material, and relit image data derived from a curated dataset of approximately ~12K artist-designed synthetic Blender objects called BlenderVault. We incorporate this diffusion prior with an inverse rendering framework where we use score distillation sampling (SDS) to guide the optimization of the albedo and materials, improving relighting performance in comparison with previous work. We validate MaterialFusion's relighting performance on 4 datasets of synthetic and real objects under diverse illumination conditions, showing our diffusion-aided approach significantly improves the appearance of reconstructed objects under novel lighting conditions. We intend to publicly release our BlenderVault dataset to support further research in this field.",

        "abstract": "Current advances in human head modeling allow the generation of plausible-looking 3D head models via neural representations, such as NeRFs and SDFs. Nevertheless, constructing complete high-fidelity head models with explicitly controlled animation remains an issue. Furthermore, completing the head geometry based on a partial observation, e.g., coming from a depth sensor, while preserving a high level of detail is often problematic for the existing methods. We introduce a generative model for detailed 3D head meshes on top of an articulated 3DMM, simultaneously allowing explicit animation and high-detail preservation. Our method is trained in two stages. First, we register a parametric head model with vertex displacements to each mesh of the recently introduced NPHM dataset of accurate 3D head scans. The estimated displacements are baked into a hand-crafted UV layout. Second, we train a StyleGAN model to generalize over the UV maps of displacements, which we later refer to as HeadCraft. The decomposition of the parametric model and high-quality vertex displacements allows us to animate the model and modify the regions semantically. We demonstrate the results of unconditional sampling, fitting to a scan and editing.",

Our model captures the salient characteristics of human skin, i.e., nonlinear stretching properties, anisotropic stiffness, direction-dependent pre-stretch, and heterogeneous sliding behavior. In particular, we introduce a novel representation of Langer lines, which describe the distribution of principal material directions across the human body. We further propose an optimization-based approach for inferring spatially-varying pre-stretch from motion capture data. We implement our new model using a computationally efficient intrinsic representation that simulates skin as a two-dimensional Lagrangian mesh embedded in the three-dimensional body surface.\nWe demonstrate our method on a diverse set of body models, shapes, and poses and compare to experimentally-obtained skin motion data. Our results indicate that our method produces smoother and more plausible skin deformations than a baseline method and shows good accuracy compared to real-world data.",

However, existing optimization methods assume opaque surfaces and therefore cannot properly reconstruct translucent surfaces and sub-pixel thin structures, which also exhibit low opacity due to the blending effect. While neural radiance field (NeRF) based methods can model semi-transparency and synthesize novel views with photo-realistic quality, their volumetric representation tightly couples geometry (surface occupancy) and material property (surface opacity), and therefore cannot be easily converted into surfaces without introducing artifacts. We present \u03b1Surf, a novel scene representation with decoupled geometry and opacity for the reconstruction of surfaces with translucent or blending effects. Ray-surface intersections on our representation can be found in closed-form via analytical solutions of cubic polynomials, avoiding Monte-Carlo sampling, and are fully differentiable by construction. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our approach can accurately reconstruct translucent and extremely thin surfaces, achieving better reconstruction quality than state-of-the-art SDF and NeRF methods.",

        "abstract": "Existing methods like Neural Radiation Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have made significant strides in facial attribute control such as facial animation and components editing, yet they struggle with fine-grained representation and scalability in dynamic head modeling. To address these limitations, we propose GaussianStyle, a novel framework that integrates the volumetric strengths of 3DGS with the powerful implicit representation of StyleGAN. The GaussianStyle preserves structural information, such as expressions and poses, using Gaussian points, while projecting the implicit volumetric representation into StyleGAN to capture high-frequency details and mitigate the over-smoothing commonly observed in neural texture rendering. Experimental outcomes indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in reenactment, novel view synthesis, and animation.",

        "abstract": "Extending the translation equivariance property of convolutional neural networks to larger symmetry groups has been shown to reduce sample complexity and enable more discriminative feature learning. Further, exploiting additional symmetries facilitates greater weight sharing than standard convolutions, leading to an enhanced network expressivity without an increase in parameter count. However, extending the equivariant properties of a convolution layer comes at a computational cost. In particular, for 3D data, expanding equivariance to the SE(3) group (rotation and translation) results in a 6D convolution operation, which is not tractable for larger data samples such as 3D scene scans. While efforts have been made to develop efficient SE(3) equivariant networks, existing approaches rely on discretization or only introduce global rotation equivariance. This limits their applicability to point clouds representing a scene composed of multiple objects. This work presents an efficient, continuous, and local SE(3) equivariant convolution layer for point cloud processing based on general group convolution and local reference frames. Our experiments show that our approach achieves competitive or superior performance across a range of datasets and tasks, including object classification and semantic segmentation, with negligible computational overhead.",

        "abstract": "Neural radiance fields, which represent a 3D scene as a color field and a density field, have demonstrated great progress in novel view synthesis yet are unfavorable for editing due to the implicitness. This work studies the task of efficient 3D editing, where we focus on **editing speed** and **user interactivity**. To this end, we propose to learn the color field as an explicit 2D appearance aggregation, also called canonical image, with which users can easily customize their 3D editing via 2D image processing. We complement the canonical image with a projection field that maps 3D points onto 2D pixels for texture query. This field is initialized with a pseudo canonical camera model and optimized with offset regularity to ensure the **naturalness** of the canonical image. Extensive experiments on different datasets suggest that our representation, dubbed ***AGAP***, well supports various ways of 3D editing (*e.g.*, stylization, instance segmentation, and interactive drawing). Our approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency by being at least 20$\\times$ faster per edit compared to existing NeRF-based editing methods.

        "abstract": "Large diffusion models demonstrate remarkable zero-shot capabilities in novel view synthesis from a single image. However, these models often face challenges in maintaining consistency across novel and reference views. A crucial factor leading to this issue is the limited utilization of contextual information from reference views. Specifically, when there is an overlap in the viewing frustum between two views, it is essential to ensure that the corresponding regions maintain consistency in both geometry and appearance. This observation leads to a simple yet effective approach, where we propose to use epipolar geometry to locate and retrieve overlapping information from the input view. This information is then incorporated into the generation of target views, eliminating the need for training or fine-tuning, as the process requires no learnable parameters. Furthermore, to enhance the overall consistency of generated views, we extend the utilization of epipolar attention to a multi-view setting, allowing retrieval of overlapping information from the input view and other target views. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in significantly improving the consistency of synthesized views without the need for any fine-tuning. Moreover, This enhancement also boosts the performance of downstream applications such as 3D reconstruction. The code is available at https://github.com/botaoye/ConsisSyn.",

        "abstract": "Audio-driven talking head generation has drawn much attention in recent years, and many efforts have been made in lip-sync, facial motion, head pose generation, and video quality. However, no model has yet led or tied on all these metrics due to the one-to-many mapping between audio and motion. In this paper, we propose VividTalk, a two-stage generic framework that supports generating high-visual quality talking head videos with all the above properties. Specifically, in the first stage, we map the audio to mesh by learning two motions, including non-rigid facial motion and rigid head motion. For facial motion, both blendshape and vertex are adopted as the intermediate representation to maximize the representation ability of the model. For head motion, a novel learnable head pose codebook with a two-phase training mechanism is proposed. In the second stage, we proposed a dual branch motion-vae and a generator to transform the meshes into dense motion and synthesize high-quality video frame-by-frame. Extensive experiments show that the proposed VividTalk can generate high-visual quality talking head videos with lip-sync and realistic enhanced by a large margin, and outperforms previous state-of-the-art works in objective and subjective comparisons. The code will be publicly released upon publication.",

        "abstract": "Maximal cliques (MAC) represent a novel state-of-the-art approach for 3D registration from correspondences, however, it still suffers from extremely severe outliers. In this paper, we introduce a robust learning-free estimator called MAC++, exploring maximal cliques for 3D registration from the following two perspectives:  1) A novel hypothesis generation method utilizing putative seeds through voting to guide the construction of maximal clique pools, effectively preserving more potential correct hypotheses. 2) A progressive hypothesis evaluation method that continuously reduces the solution space in a ``global-clusters-cluster-individual'' manner rather than traditional one-shot techniques, greatly alleviating the issue of missing good hypotheses. Experiments conducted on U3M, 3DMatch/3DLoMatch, and KITTI-LC datasets show the new state-of-the-art performance of MAC++. MAC++ demonstrates the capability to handle extremely low inlier ratio data where MAC fails (e.g., showing 27.1\\%/30.6\\% registration recall improvements on 3DMatch/3DLoMatch with < 1\\% inliers). The code will be released.",

Additionally, we introduce the Normalised Hungarian Distance (NHD) metric for an accurate evaluation of 3D detection results, addressing the limitations of traditional IoU and GIoU metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalisation across various object categories and datasets.",

        "abstract": "World-wide detailed 2D maps require enormous collective efforts. OpenStreetMap is the result of 11 million registered users manually annotating the GPS location of over 1.75 billion entries, including distinctive landmarks and common urban objects. At the same time, manual annotations can include errors and are slow to update, limiting the map's accuracy. Maps from Motion (MfM) is a step forward to automatize such time-consuming map making procedure by computing 2D maps of semantic objects directly from a collection of uncalibrated multi-view images. From each image, we extract a set of object detections, and estimate their spatial arrangement in a top-down local map centered in the reference frame of the camera that captured the image.\nAligning these local maps is not a trivial problem, since they provide incomplete, noisy fragments of the scene, and matching detections across them is unreliable because of the presence of repeated pattern and the limited appearance variability of urban objects. We address this with a novel graph-based framework, that encodes the spatial and semantic distribution of the objects detected in each image, and learns how to combine them to predict the objects' poses in a global reference system, while taking into account all possible detection matches and preserving the topology observed in each image. \nDespite the complexity of the problem, our best model achieves global 2D registration with an average accuracy within $4$ meters (i.e., below GPS accuracy) even on sparse sequences with strong viewpoint change, on which COLMAP has an $80\\%$ failure rate. \nWe provide extensive evaluation on synthetic and real-world data, showing how the method obtains a solution even in scenarios where standard optimization techniques fail.

        "abstract": "Geometric priors are often used to enhance 3D reconstruction. With many smartphones featuring low-resolution depth sensors and the prevalence of off-the-shelf monocular geometry estimators, incorporating geometric priors as regularization signals has become common in 3D vision tasks. However, the accuracy of depth estimates from mobile devices is typically poor for highly detailed geometry, and monocular estimators often suffer from poor multi-view consistency and precision. In this work, we propose an approach for joint surface depth and normal refinement of Gaussian Splatting methods for accurate 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes. We develop supervision strategies that adaptively filters low-quality depth and normal estimates by comparing the consistency of the priors during optimization. We mitigate regularization in regions where prior estimates have high uncertainty or ambiguities. Our filtering strategy and optimization design demonstrate significant improvements in both mesh estimation and novel-view synthesis for both 3D and 2D Gaussian Splatting-based methods on challenging indoor room datasets. Furthermore, we explore the use of alternative meshing strategies for finer geometry extraction. We develop a scale-aware meshing strategy inspired by TSDF and octree-based isosurface extraction, which recovers finer details from Gaussian models compared to other commonly used open-source meshing tools.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents Particle Rendering (PR), a new implicit rendering approach that extends Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) by incorporating incident light along with traditional outgoing light modeling. In our framework, a 3D scene consists of a mass of particles, each offering a deeper understanding of light interactions by reflecting and emitting light in all directions. Our methodology involves a three-phase training pipeline: 1) Estimating the outgoing light field through a NeRF model; 2) Distilling the incident light field. A simple metric is introduced to assess the quality of the ray for better supervision; 3) Implicit rendering. We propose an implicit method to aggregate incident and outgoing fields that leverages Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) to directly infer final pixel values, thus avoiding the limitation of traditional physically-based rendering techniques. The effectiveness of PR is demonstrated through state-of-the-art results in various challenging indoor and outdoor scenes, emphasizing its capability to handle complex lighting and reflective materials.",

        "abstract": "We present Drivable 3D Gaussian Avatars (D3GA), a multi-layered 3D controllable model for human bodies that utilizes 3D Gaussian primitives embedded into tetrahedral cages. The advantage of using cages compared to commonly employed linear blend skinning (LBS) is that primitives like 3D Gaussians are naturally re-oriented and their kernels are stretched via the deformation gradients of the encapsulating tetrahedron. Additional offsets are modeled for the tetrahedron vertices, effectively decoupling the low-dimensional driving poses from the extensive set of primitives to be rendered. This separation is achieved through the localized influence of each tetrahedron on 3D Gaussians, resulting in improved optimization. Using the cage-based deformation model, we introduce a compositional pipeline that decomposes an avatar into layers, such as garments, hands, or faces, improving the modeling of phenomena like garment sliding. These parts can be conditioned on different driving signals, such as keypoints for facial expressions or joint-angle vectors for garments and the body. Our experiments on two multi-view datasets with varied body shapes, clothes, and motions show higher-quality results. They surpass PSNR and SSIM metrics of other SOTA methods using the same data while offering greater flexibility and compactness.",

        "abstract": "3D scene generation has quickly become a challenging new research direction, fueled by consistent improvements of 2D generative diffusion models. Current methods generate scenes by iteratively stitching newly generated images with existing geometry, using pre-trained monocular depth estimators to lift the generated images to 3D. The predicted depth is fused with the existing scene representation through various alignment operations. In this work, we make two fundamental contributions to the field of 3D scene generation. First, we note that lifting images to 3D with a monocular depth estimation model is suboptimal as it ignores the geometry of the existing scene, thus prompting the need for alignment. We introduce a depth completion model to directly learn the 3D fusion process, resulting in improved geometric coherence of generated scenes. Second, we introduce a new benchmark to evaluate the geometric accuracy of scene generation methods. We show that the commonly used CLIP score between scene prompts and images is unsuitable for measuring the geometric quality of a scene and introduce a depth-based metric. Our benchmark thus offers an additional dimension to gauge the quality of generated scenes.",

However, challenges persist in achieving high accuracy and precision, especially in indoor environments. This paper rigorously analyzes the performance of various indoor LiDAR systems under different conditions. We present a novel experimental methodology, which quantifies LiDAR accuracy and precision, examining factors such as sensor type, environmental conditions, and target characteristics. Using an extensive dataset collected from nine distinct locations with more than 36000 LiDAR scans, combined with high-precision reference data from a FARO laser scanner, our analysis reveals significant insights into the accuracy and precision across different LiDAR models. The resulting public dataset, which include detailed point clouds and groundtruth labels, are expected to serve as a valuable resource for developing and validating advanced LiDAR processing techniques and benchmarks for various applications. The dataset will be publicly available at http://lidaraccuracy.github.io.",

In this paper, we aim to mimic this spatial cognition ability. We thus formulate the task of *Out of Sight, Not Out of Mind* -- 3D tracking active objects using observations captured through an egocentric camera. We introduce a  simple but effective approach to address this challenging problem, called Lift, Match, and Keep (LMK). LMK **lifts** partial 2D observations to 3D world coordinates, **matches** them over time using visual appearance, 3D location and interactions to form object tracks, and **keeps** these object tracks even when they go out-of-view of the camera.\nWe benchmark LMK on 100 long videos from EPIC-KITCHENS. Our results demonstrate that spatial cognition is critical for correctly locating objects over short and long time scales. E.g., for one long egocentric video, we estimate the 3D location of 50 active objects. \nAfter 120 seconds, 57\\% of the objects are correctly localized by LMK, compared to just 33\\% by a recent 3D method for egocentric videos and 17\\% by a general 2D tracking method.",

        "abstract": "Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) is an important yet challenging problem with applications across various domains including motion capture, augmented reality, and biomechanics. Accurately predicting human pose parameters from a single image remains a challenging 3D computer vision task. In this work, we introduce DeforHMR, a novel regression-based monocular HMR framework designed to enhance the prediction of human pose parameters using deformable attention transformers. DeforHMR leverages a novel query-agnostic deformable cross-attention mechanism within the transformer decoder to effectively regress the visual features extracted from a frozen pretrained vision transformer (ViT) encoder. The proposed deformable cross-attention mechanism allows the model to attend to relevant spatial features more flexibly and in a data-dependent manner. Equipped with a transformer decoder capable of spatially-nuanced attention, DeforHMR achieves state-of-the-art performance for single-frame regression-based methods on the widely used 3D HMR benchmarks 3DPW and RICH. By pushing the boundary on the field of 3D human mesh recovery through deformable attention, we introduce an new, effective paradigm for decoding local spatial information from large pretrained vision encoders in computer vision.",

        "abstract": "Implicit neural fields have made remarkable progress in reconstructing 3D surfaces from multiple images; however, they encounter challenges when it comes to separating individual objects within a scene. Previous approaches to this problem require ground-truth segmentation masks and introduce floating artifacts in occluded parts of the scene. \n\nWe address these challenges with ObjectCarver. ObjectCarver requires no ground-truth segmentation; all it needs is just a few user clicks in a single view. ObjectCarver also introduces a new loss function that prevents floaters and avoids inappropriate carving-out due to occlusion. \n\nFinally, ObjectCarver uses a simple initialization technique that significantly speeds up the process while preserving geometric details. We demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively on multiple datasets (including a new dataset and benchmark with complete ground-truth) that ObjectCarver produces more accurate reconstructions of each object while minimizing artifacts",

        "abstract": "The ability to cope with out-of-distribution (OOD) corruptions and adversarial attacks is crucial in real-world safety-demanding applications. In this study, we develop a general mechanism to increase point clouds neural networks robustness based on focus analysis.\nRecent studies have revealed the phenomenon of \\textit{Overfocusing}, which leads to a performance drop. When the network is primarily influenced by small input regions, it becomes less robust and prone to misclassify under noise and corruptions.\nHowever, quantifying overfocusing is still vague and lacks clear definitions. Here, we provide a mathematical definition of \\textbf{focus}, \\textbf{overfocusing} and \\textbf{underfocusing}. The notions are general, but in this study, we specifically investigate the case of 3D point clouds.\nWe observe that corrupted sets result in a biased focus distribution compared to the clean training set.\nWe show that as focus distribution deviates from the one learned in the training phase - classification performance deteriorates.\nWe thus propose a parameter-free \\textbf{refocusing} algorithm that aims to unify all corruptions under the same distribution.\nWe validate our findings on a 3D zero-shot classification task, achieving SOTA in robust 3D classification on ModelNet-C dataset, and in adversarial defense against Shape-Invariant attack.",

        "abstract": "Generative modeling of 3D human bodies have been studied extensively in computer vision. The core is to design a compact latent representation that is both expressive and semantically interpretable, yet existing approaches struggle to achieve both requirements. In this work, we introduce JADE, a generative framework that learns the variations of human shapes with fined-grained control. Our key insight is a joint-aware latent representation that decomposes human bodies into skeleton structures, modeled by joint positions, and local surface geometries, characterized by features attached to each joint. This disentangled latent space design enables geometric and semantic interpretation, facilitating users with flexible controllability. To generate coherent and plausible human shapes under our proposed decomposition, we also present a cascaded pipeline where two diffusions are employed to model the distribution of skeleton structures and local surface geometries respectively. Extensive experiments are conducted on public datasets, where we demonstrate the effectiveness of JADE framework in multiple tasks in terms of autoencoding reconstruction accuracy, editing controllability and generation quality compared with existing methods.",

        "abstract": "We introduce SPAFormer, an innovative model designed to overcome the combinatorial explosion challenge in the 3D Part Assembly (3D-PA) task. This task requires accurate prediction of each part's poses in sequential steps. As the number of parts increases, the possible assembly combinations increase exponentially, leading to a combinatorial explosion that severely hinders the efficacy of 3D-PA. SPAFormer addresses this problem by leveraging weak constraints from assembly sequences, effectively reducing the solution space's complexity. Since the sequence of parts conveys construction rules similar to sentences structured through words, our model explores both parallel and autoregressive generation. We further strengthen SPAFormer through knowledge enhancement strategies that utilize the attributes of parts and their sequence information, enabling it to capture the inherent assembly pattern and relationships among sequentially ordered parts. We also construct a more challenging benchmark named PartNet-Assembly covering 21 varied categories to more comprehensively validate the effectiveness of SPAFormer. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalization capabilities of SPAFormer, particularly with multi-tasking and in scenarios requiring long-horizon assembly. Code is available at https://github.com/xuboshen/SPAFormer.",

        "abstract": "Current text-to-avatar methods often rely on implicit representations (e.g., NeRF, SDF, and DMTet), leading to 3D content that artists cannot easily edit and animate in graphics software. This paper introduces a novel framework for generating stylized head avatars from text guidance, which leverages locally learnable mesh deformation and 2D diffusion priors to achieve high-quality digital assets for attribute-preserving manipulation. Given a template mesh, our method represents mesh deformation with per-face Jacobians and adaptively modulates local deformation using a learnable vector field. This vector field enables anisotropic scaling while preserving the rotation of vertices, which can better express identity and geometric details. We also employ landmark- and contour-based regularization terms to balance the expressiveness and plausibility of generated head avatars from multiple views without relying on any specific shape prior. Our framework can generate realistic shapes and textures that can be further edited via text, while supporting seamless editing using the preserved attributes from the template mesh, such as 3DMM parameters, blendshapes, and UV coordinates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate diverse and expressive head avatars with high-quality meshes that artists can easily manipulate in 3D graphics software, facilitating downstream applications such as efficient asset creation and animation with preserved attributes.",

        "abstract": "We introduce RealmDreamer, a technique for generating forward-facing 3D scenes from text descriptions. Our method optimizes a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation to match complex text prompts using pretrained diffusion models. Our key insight is to leverage 2D inpainting diffusion models conditioned on an initial scene estimate to provide low variance and high-fidelity estimates of unknown regions during 3D distillation. In conjunction, we imbue correct geometry with geometric distillation from a depth diffusion model, conditioned on samples from the inpainting model. We find that the initialization of the optimization is crucial, and provide a principled methodology for doing so. Notably, our technique doesn't require video or multi-view data and can synthesize various high-quality 3D scenes in different styles with complex layouts. Further, the generality of our method allows 3D synthesis from a single image. As measured by a comprehensive user study, our method outperforms all existing approaches, preferred by 88-95%.

Our method effectively parameterizes features through an explicit curriculum training procedure, incrementally increasing scene complexity during optimization. Experimental results show that the prior induced by our approach is both robust and adaptable across a wide variety of scenes, establishing FourieRF as a strong and versatile baseline for the few-shot rendering problem. While our approach significantly reduces artifacts, it may still lead to reconstruction errors in severely under-constrained scenarios, particularly where view occlusion leaves parts of the shape uncovered.

Nonetheless, it could be a demanding endeavor, given its intricate nature necessitating a deep understanding of rules, algorithms, and parameters. To reduce workload, we introduce 3D-GPT, a framework utilizing large language models~(LLMs) for instruction-driven 3D modeling. 3D-GPT positions LLMs as proficient problem solvers, dissecting the procedural 3D modeling tasks into accessible segments and appointing the apt agent for each task. 3D-GPT integrates three core agents: the task dispatch agent, the conceptualization agent, and the modeling agent. They collaboratively achieve two objectives. First, it enhances concise initial scene descriptions, evolving them into detailed forms while dynamically adapting the text based on subsequent instructions. Second, it integrates procedural generation, extracting parameter values from enriched text to effortlessly interface with 3D software for asset creation. Our empirical investigations confirm that 3D-GPT not only interprets and executes instructions, delivering reliable results but also collaborates effectively with human designers. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with Blender, unlocking expanded manipulation possibilities. Our work highlights the potential of LLMs in 3D modeling, offering a basic framework for future advancements in scene generation and animation.",

        "abstract": "While text-to-3D and image-to-3D generation tasks have received considerable attention, one important but under-explored field between them is controllable text-to-3D generation, which we mainly focus on in this work. To address this task, 1) we introduce Multi-view ControlNet (MVControl), a novel neural network architecture designed to enhance existing pre-trained multi-view diffusion models by integrating additional input conditions, such as edge, depth, normal, and scribble maps. Our innovation lies in the introduction of a conditioning module that controls the base diffusion model using both local and global embeddings, which are computed from the input condition images and camera poses. Once trained, MVControl is able to offer 3D diffusion guidance for optimization-based 3D generation. And, 2) we propose an efficient multi-stage 3D generation pipeline that leverages the benefits of recent large reconstruction models and score distillation algorithm. Building upon our MVControl architecture, we employ a unique hybrid diffusion guidance method to direct the optimization process. In pursuit of efficiency, we adopt 3D Gaussians as our representation instead of the commonly used implicit representations. We also pioneer the use of SuGaR, a hybrid representation that binds Gaussians to mesh triangle faces. This approach alleviates the issue of poor geometry in 3D Gaussians and enables the direct sculpting of fine-grained geometry on the mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalization and enables the controllable generation of high-quality 3D content.",

        "abstract": "White Light Interferometry (WLI) is a precise optical tool for measuring the 3D topography of microstructures. However, conventional WLI cannot capture the natural color of a sample's surface, which is essential for many microscale research applications that require both 3D geometry and color information. Previous methods have attempted to overcome this limitation by modifying WLI hardware and analysis software, but these solutions are often costly. In this work, we address this challenge from a computer vision multi-modal reconstruction perspective for the first time. We introduce OpticFusion, a novel approach that uses an additional digital optical microscope (OM) to achieve 3D reconstruction with natural color textures using multi-view WLI and OM images. Our method employs a two-step data association process to obtain the poses of WLI and OM data. By leveraging the neural implicit representation, we fuse multi-modal data and apply color decomposition technology to extract the sample's natural color. Tested on our multi-modal dataset of various microscale samples, OpticFusion achieves detailed 3D reconstructions with color textures. Our method provides an effective tool for practical applications across numerous microscale research fields. The source code and our real-world dataset are available at https://github.com/zju3dv/OpticFusion.",

Conveniently, the concepts can be defined as either text queries,\ne.g., \u201ca dog\u201d and \u201ca turtle,\u201d or inspirational images, and the local regions can\nbe selected as any number of vertices on the mesh. We can effectively control\nthe influence of the concepts and mix them together using a novel score\ndistillation approach, referred to as the Blended Score Distillation (BSD). BSD\noperates on each attention layer of the denoising U-Net of a diffusion model\nas it extracts and injects the per-objective activations into a unified denoising\npipeline from which the deformation gradients are calculated. To localize the\nexpression of these activations, we create a probabilistic Region of Interest\n(ROI) map on the surface of the mesh, and turn it into 3D-consistent masks\nthat we use to control the expression of these activations. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of BSD empirically and show that it can deform various\nmeshes towards multiple objectives.",

        "abstract": "The interest in matching non-rigidly deformed shapes represented as raw point clouds is rising due to the proliferation of low-cost 3D sensors. Yet, the task is challenging since point clouds are irregular and there is a lack of intrinsic shape information. We propose to tackle these challenges by learning a new shape representation -- a per-point high dimensional embedding, in an embedding space where semantically similar points share similar embeddings. The learned embedding has multiple beneficial properties: it is aware of the underlying shape geometry and is robust to shape deformations and various shape artefacts, such as noise and partiality. Consequently, this embedding can be directly employed to retrieve high-quality dense correspondences through a simple nearest neighbor search in the embedding space. Extensive experiments demonstrate new state-of-the-art results and robustness in numerous challenging non-rigid shape matching benchmarks and show its great potential in other shape analysis tasks, such as segmentation.",

        "abstract": "3D part segmentation is still an open problem in the field of 3D vision and AR/VR. Due to limited 3D labeled data, traditional supervised segmentation methods fall short in generalizing to unseen shapes and categories. Recently, the advancement in vision-language models' zero-shot abilities has brought a surge in open-world 3D segmentation methods. While these methods show promising results for 3D scenes or objects, they do not generalize well to 3D humans. In this paper, we present the first open-vocabulary segmentation method capable of handling 3D human. Our framework can segment the human category into desired fine-grained parts based on the textual prompt. We design a simple segmentation pipeline, leveraging SAM to generate multi-view proposals in 2D and proposing a novel HumanCLIP model to create unified embeddings for visual and textual inputs. Compared with existing pre-trained CLIP models, the HumanCLIP model yields more accurate embeddings for human-centric contents. We also design a simple-yet-effective MaskFusion module, which classifies and fuses multi-view features into 3D semantic masks without complex voting and grouping mechanisms. The design of decoupling mask proposals and text input also significantly boosts the efficiency of per-prompt inference. Experimental results on various 3D human datasets show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation methods by a large margin. In addition, we show that our method can be directly applied to various 3D representations including meshes, point clouds, and 3D Gaussian Splatting.",

        "abstract": "We present DreamBeast, a novel method based on score distillation sampling (SDS) for generating fantastical 3D animal assets composed of distinct parts. Existing SDS methods often struggle with this generation task due to a limited understanding of part-level semantics in text-to-image diffusion models. While recent diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion 3, demonstrate a better part-level understanding, they are prohibitively slow and exhibit other common problems associated with single-view diffusion models. DreamBeast overcomes this limitation through a novel part-aware knowledge transfer mechanism. For each generated asset, we efficiently extract part-level knowledge from the Stable Diffusion 3 model into a 3D part-affinity implicit representation. This enables us to instantly generate part-affinity maps from arbitrary camera views, which we then use to modulate the guidance of a multi-view diffusion model during SDS to generate 3D assets of fantastical animals. DreamBeast significantly enhances the quality of generated 3D creatures with user-specified part compositions while reducing computational overhead, as demonstrated by extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations.",

We propose a new task named online full-body motion reaction synthesis, which generates humanoid reactions based on the human actor's motions. The previous work only focuses on human interaction without objects and generates body reactions without hand. Besides, they also do not consider the task as an online setting, which means the reactor can only see the current information and cannot perceive the future actions of the actor.  To support the task of online full-body motion reaction synthesis, we construct two datasets named HHI and CoChair and propose a unified method.  Specifically, we encode the motion of human actors and objects from an interaction-centric view through a social affordance representation.\n Then we leverage a social affordance forecasting scheme to enable the reactor to predict based on the imagined future. We also use SE(3)-Equivariant Neural Networks to learn the local frame to canonicalize the social affordance.  Experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively generates high-quality reactions on HHI and CoChair. Furthermore, we also validate our method on existing human interaction datasets Interhuman and Chi3D in real-time at 25 fps.",

        "abstract": "Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have established a new paradigm for 3D scene reconstruction, with subsequent work achieving high-quality real-time rendering. However, reconstructing large-scale scenes from oblique aerial photography presents unique challenges, such as varying spatial scale distributions and a constrained range of tilt angles, often resulting in high memory consumption and reduced rendering quality at extrapolated viewpoints. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach named Oblique-MERF to accommodate the distinctive characteristics of oblique photography datasets and support real-time rendering on various common devices. Firstly, an innovative adaptive occupancy plane is proposed to constrain the sampling space. Additionally, we propose a smoothness regularization loss for view-dependent color to enhance the  MLP's ability to generalize to untrained viewpoints. Experimental results demonstrate that Oblique-MERF reduces VRAM usage by approximately 40% while maintaining competitive rendering quality compared to baseline methods, and achieves higher frame rates with more realistic rendering even at untrained extrapolated viewpoints.",

        "abstract": "We propose a fast and accurate surface reconstruction algorithm for unorganized point clouds using an implicit representation.  Recent learning methods are either single-object representations with small neural models that allow for high surface details but require per-object training or generalized representations that require larger models and generalize to newer shapes but lack details, and inference is slow. We propose a new implicit representation for general 3D shapes that is faster than all the baselines at their optimum resolution, with only a marginal loss in performance compared to the state-of-the-art. We achieve the best accuracy-speed trade-off using three key contributions. Many implicit methods extract features from the point cloud to classify whether a query point is inside or outside the object. First, to speed up the reconstruction, we show that this feature extraction does not need to use the query point at an early stage (lazy query). Second, we use a parallel multi-scale grid representation to develop robust features for different noise levels and input resolutions. Finally, we show that attention across scales can provide improved reconstruction results. The code will be made available.",

        "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become the de facto method of 3D representation in many vision tasks. This calls for the 3D understanding directly in this representation space. To facilitate the research in this direction, we first build a large-scale dataset of 3DGS using the commonly used ShapeNet and ModelNet datasets. Our dataset ShapeSplat consists of 65K objects from 87 unique categories, whose labels are in accordance with the respective datasets. The creation of this dataset utilized the compute equivalent of 2 GPU years on a TITAN XP GPU.\n\nWe utilize our dataset for unsupervised pretraining and supervised finetuning for classification and segmentation tasks. To this end, we introduce Gaussian-MAE, which highlights the unique benefits of representation learning from Gaussian parameters. Through exhaustive experiments, we provide several valuable insights. In particular, we show that  (1) the distribution of the optimized GS centroids significantly differs from the uniformly sampled point cloud (used for initialization) counterpart; (2) this change in distribution results in degradation in classification but improvement in segmentation tasks when using only the centroids; (3) to leverage additional Gaussian parameters, we propose Gaussian feature grouping in a normalized feature space, along with splats pooling layer, offering a tailored solution to effectively group and embed similar Gaussians, which leads to notable improvement in finetuning tasks. Our dataset and model are publicly available at https://unique1i.github.io/ShapeSplat.",

        "abstract": "Animating virtual characters with holistic co-speech gestures is a challenging but critical task. Previous systems have primarily focused on the weak correlation between audio and gestures, leading to physically unnatural outcomes that degrade the user experience. To address this problem, we introduce HoleGest, a novel neural network framework based on decoupled diffusion and motion priors for the automatic generation of high-quality, expressive co-speech gestures. Our system leverages large-scale human motion datasets to learn a robust prior with low audio dependency and high motion reliance, enabling stable global motion and detailed finger movements. To improve the generation efficiency of diffusion-based models, we integrate implicit joint constraints with explicit geometric and conditional constraints, capturing complex motion distributions between large strides. This integration significantly enhances generation speed while maintaining high-quality motion. Furthermore, we design a shared embedding space for gesture-transcription text alignment, enabling the generation of semantically correct gesture actions. Extensive experiments and user feedback demonstrate the effectiveness and potential applications of our model, with our method achieving a level of realism close to the ground truth, providing an immersive user experience.",

To address the ambiguity of this setup, we present HMD$^2$, a novel system that balances motion reconstruction and generation. From a reconstruction standpoint, it aims to maximally utilize the camera streams to produce both analytical and learned features, including head motion, SLAM point cloud, and image embeddings. On the generative front, HMD$^2$ employs a multi-modal conditional motion diffusion model with a Transformer backbone to maintain temporal coherence of generated motions, and utilizes autoregressive inpainting to facilitate online motion inference with minimal latency (0.17 seconds). We show that our system provides an effective and robust solution that scales to a diverse dataset of over 200 hours of motion in complex indoor and outdoor environments.",

We then propose a metric that evaluates overall video quality and the ability to preserve details with view changes, which we use to analyze the trade-offs of individual and combined conditions. Finally, we identify an optimal combination of conditions. We calibrate camera positions in our datasets for scale consistency across scenes, and we train our scene exploration model, CameraCtrl3D, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.\nExample videos generated by CameraCtrl3D are available at  https://camctrl3d.github.io/",

        "abstract": "We tackle the problem of generating highly realistic and plausible mirror reflections using diffusion-based generative models. We formulate this problem as an image inpainting task, allowing for more user control over the placement of mirrors during the generation process. To enable this, we create SynMirror, a large-scale dataset of diverse synthetic scenes with objects placed in front of mirrors. SynMirror contains around 198k samples rendered from 66k unique 3D objects, along with their associated depth maps, normal maps and instance-wise segmentation masks, to capture relevant geometric properties of the scene. Using this dataset, we propose a novel depth-conditioned inpainting method called MirrorFusion, which generates high-quality, realistic, shape and appearance-aware reflections of real-world objects. MirrorFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SynMirror, as demonstrated by extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully tackle the challenging problem of generating controlled and faithful mirror reflections of an object in a scene using diffusion-based models. SynMirror and MirrorFusion open up new avenues for image editing and augmented reality applications for practitioners and researchers alike.

        "abstract": "Due to the rapid development of panorama cameras, the task of estimating panorama depth has attracted significant attention from the computer vision community, especially in applications such as robot sensing and autonomous driving. \nHowever, existing methods relying on different projection formats often encounter challenges, either struggling with distortion and discontinuity in the case of equirectangular, cubemap, and tangent projections, or experiencing a loss of texture details with the spherical projection. \nTo tackle these concerns, we present SphereFusion, an end-to-end framework that combines the strengths of various projection methods. \nSpecifically, SphereFusion initially employs 2D image convolution and mesh operations to extract two distinct types of features from the panorama image in both equirectangular and spherical projection domains. These features are then projected onto the spherical domain, where a gate fusion module selects the most reliable features for fusion. Finally, SphereFusion estimates panorama depth within the spherical domain.\nMeanwhile, SphereFusion employs a cache strategy to improve the efficiency of mesh operation.\nExtensive experiments on three public panorama datasets demonstrate that SphereFusion achieves competitive results with other state-of-the-art methods, while presenting the fastest inference speed at only 17 ms on a 512$\\times$1024 panorama image.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to encode a 3D scene into an extremely compact representation from 2D images and to enable its transmittance, decoding and rendering in real-time across various platforms. Despite the progress in NeRFs and Gaussian Splats, their large model size and specialized renderers make it challenging to distribute free-viewpoint 3D content as easily as images.  To address this, we have designed a novel 3D representation that encodes the plenoptic function into sinusoidal function indexed dense volumes. This approach facilitates feature sharing across different locations, improving compactness over traditional spatial voxels. The memory footprint of the dense 3D feature grid can be further reduced using spatial decomposition techniques. This design combines the strengths of spatial hashing functions and voxel decomposition, resulting in a model size as small as 150 KB for each 3D scene. Moreover, PPNG features a lightweight rendering pipeline with only 300 lines of code that decodes its representation into standard GL textures and fragment shaders. This enables real-time rendering using the traditional GL pipeline, ensuring universal compatibility and efficiency across various platforms without additional dependencies.",

        "abstract": "Reconstructing scenes and tracking motion are two sides of the same coin. Tracking points allow for geometric reconstruction [13], while geometric reconstruction of (dynamic) scenes allows for 3D tracking of points over time [22, 36]. The latter was recently also exploited for 2D point tracking to overcome occlusion ambiguities by lifting tracking directly into 3D [35]. However, above approaches either require offline processing or multi-view camera setups both unrealistic for real-world applications like robot navigation or mixed reality. We target the challenge of online 2D and 3D point tracking from unposed monocular camera input introducing Dynamic Online Monocular Reconstruction (DynOMo). We leverage 3D Gaussian splatting to reconstruct dynamic scenes in an online fashion. Our approach extends 3D Gaussians to capture new content and object motions while estimating camera movements from a single RGB frame. DynOMo stands out by enabling emergence of point trajectories through robust image feature reconstruction and a novel similarity-enhanced regularization term, without requiring any correspondence-level supervision. It sets the first baseline for online point tracking with monocular unposed cameras, achieving performance on par with existing methods. We aim to inspire the community to advance online point tracking and reconstruction, expanding the applicability to diverse real-world scenarios.",

Unfortunately, manual annotations for these tasks are prohibitively costly. We tackle this problem with the task of class-agnostic unsupervised online instance segmentation and tracking. To that end, we leverage an instance segmentation backbone and propose a new training recipe that enables the online tracking of objects. Our network is trained on pseudo-labels, eliminating the need for manual annotations. We conduct an evaluation using metrics adapted for temporal instance segmentation. Computing these metrics requires temporally-consistent instance labels. When unavailable, we construct these labels using the available 3D bounding boxes and semantic labels in the dataset. We compare our method against strong baselines and demonstrate its superiority across two different outdoor Lidar datasets.",

However, their applications in understanding 3D environments remain limited, primarily offering textual or numerical outputs without generating dense, informative segmentation masks. This paper introduces Reason3D, a novel LLM designed for comprehensive 3D understanding. Reason3D processes point cloud data and text prompts to produce textual responses and segmentation masks, enabling advanced tasks such as 3D reasoning segmentation, hierarchical searching, express referring, and question answering with detailed mask outputs. We propose a hierarchical mask decoder that employs a coarse-to-fine approach to segment objects within expansive scenes. It begins with a coarse location estimation, followed by object mask estimation, using two unique tokens predicted by LLMs based on the textual query. Experimental results on large-scale ScanNet and Matterport3D datasets validate the effectiveness of our Reason3D across various tasks.",

        "abstract": "Comprehensive testing of autonomous systems through simulation is essential to ensure the safety of autonomous driving vehicles. This requires the generation of safety-critical scenarios that extend beyond the limitations of real-world data collection, as many of these scenarios are rare or rarely encountered on public roads.\nHowever, evaluating most existing novel view synthesis (NVS) methods relies on sporadic sampling of image frames from the training data, comparing the rendered images with ground-truth images. Unfortunately, this evaluation protocol falls short of meeting the actual requirements in closed-loop simulations. Specifically, the true application demands the capability to render novel views that extend beyond the original trajectory (such as cross-lane views), which are challenging to capture in the real world.\nTo address this, this paper presents a synthetic dataset for novel driving view synthesis evaluation, which is specifically designed for autonomous driving simulations. This unique dataset includes testing images captured by deviating from the training trajectory by $1-4$ meters. It comprises six sequences that cover various times and weather conditions. Each sequence contains $450$ training images, $120$ testing images, and their corresponding camera poses and intrinsic parameters. Leveraging this novel dataset, we establish the first realistic benchmark for evaluating existing NVS approaches under front-only and multicamera settings. The experimental findings underscore the significant gap in current approaches, revealing their inadequate ability to fulfill the demanding prerequisites of cross-lane or closed-loop simulation.\nOur dataset and code are released publicly on the project page: https://3d-aigc.github.io/XLD.",

While offline methods have made significant advances in isolated gesture recognition, real-world applications demand online and continuous processing. Skeleton-based methods, though effective, face challenges due to the intricate nature of hand joints and the diverse 3D motions they induce. This paper introduces AG-MAE, a novel approach that integrates anatomical constraints to guide the self-supervised training of a spatio-temporal masked autoencoder, enhancing the learning of 3D keypoint representations. By incorporating anatomical knowledge, AG-MAE learns more discriminative features for hand poses and movements, subsequently improving online gesture recognition. Evaluation on standard datasets demonstrates the superiority of our approach and its potential for real-world applications. Code is available at: https://github.com/lambda-xyz-01/AGMAE.",

        "abstract": "Animation techniques bring digital 3D worlds and characters to life. However, manual animation is tedious and automated techniques are often specialized to narrow shape classes. In our work, we propose a technique for automatic re-animation of various 3D shapes based on a motion prior extracted from a video diffusion model. Unlike existing 4D generation methods, we focus solely on the motion, and we leverage an explicit mesh-based representation compatible with existing computer-graphics pipelines. Furthermore, our utilization of diffusion features enhances accuracy of our motion fitting. We analyze efficacy of these features for animation fitting and we experimentally validate our approach for two different diffusion models and four animation models. Finally, we demonstrate that our time-efficient zero-shot method achieves a superior performance re-animating a diverse set of 3D shapes when compared to existing techniques in a user study.",

The generated assets can be directly draped and simulated on human bodies. \nWe leverage the recent progress of image-to-3D diffusion methods to generate 3D garment geometries. However, since these geometries cannot be utilized directly for downstream tasks, we propose to use them as pseudo ground-truth and set up a mesh deformation optimization procedure that deforms a base template mesh to match the generated 3D target. Carefully designed losses allow the base mesh to freely deform towards the desired target, yet preserve mesh quality and topology such that they can be simulated. \nFinally, we generate high-fidelity texture maps that are globally and locally consistent and faithfully capture the input guidance, allowing us to render the generated 3D assets. \nWith Garment3DGen users can generate the simulation-ready 3D garment of their choice without the need of artist intervention. \nWe present a plethora of quantitative and qualitative comparisons on various assets and demonstrate that Garment3DGen unlocks key applications ranging from sketch-to-simulated garments or interacting with the garments in VR.

        "abstract": "Reconstructing 3D human movements from video sequences is an important task in the fields of computer vision, graphics, and biomechanics. Although much progress has been made to infer 3D human mesh based on visual contexts provided in video sequences, generalization to in-the-wild videos still remains challenging for existing human mesh recovery (HMR) methods. To overcome inaccurate prediction, they can perform a second step optimization that refines the inaccurate estimations continuously at test time. Most optimization methods seek fitting of the body joints in the image space with respect to pseudo ground truth predicted by an off-the-shelf key point detector. However, state-of-the-art detectors still introduce errors, especially for challenging poses. In this work, we rethink the dependency on the 2D key point fitting paradigm and present NeuHMR, an optimization-based mesh recovery framework based on recent advances in neural rendering. Our method builds on Human Neural Radiance Fields that allow the refinement of human motions through animatable 2D renderings. We evaluated our method on two common benchmarks and validated its effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of inverse rendering from photometric images. Existing approaches for this problem suffer from the effects of self-shadows, inter-reflections, and lack of constraints on the surface reflectance, leading to inaccurate decomposition of reflectance and illuminations due to the ill-posed nature of inverse rendering. In this work, we propose a new method for neural inverse rendering. Our method jointly optimizes the light source position to account for the self-shadows in the images, and computes indirect illumination using a differentiable rendering layer and an importance sampling strategy. To enhance surface reflectance decomposition, we introduce a new regularization by distilling DINO features to foster accurate and consistent material decomposition. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reflectance decomposition.",

        "abstract": "Touch and vision go hand in hand, mutually enhancing our ability to understand the world. From a research perspective, the problem of mixing touch and vision together is underexplored and presents interesting challenges. To this end, we propose Tactile-Informed 3DGS, a novel approach that incorporates contact data (local depth maps) with multi-view images to achieve surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Our method optimises 3D Gaussian primitives to accurately model the object's geometry at points of contact. By creating a framework that decreases the transmittance at touch locations, we achieve a refined surface reconstruction, ensuring a uniformly smooth depth map. Touch is particularly useful when considering non-Lambertian objects (e.g. shiny or reflective surfaces) since contemporary methods tend often to fail to reconstruct such objects with fidelity. By combining vision and tactile sensing, we achieve more accurate geometry reconstructions with fewer images than prior methods. We conduct evaluation in both the virtual and real world on objects with glossy and reflective surfaces to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving reconstruction quality.",
