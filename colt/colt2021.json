        "abstract": "This paper concerns the a priori generalization analysis of the Deep Ritz Method (DRM) [W. E and B. Yu, 2017], a popular neural-network-based method for solving high dimensional partial differential equations.

In this paper, we investigate the capability of a natural average-case learning framework, heuristic PAC (heurPAC) learning to answer this and some other related questions. Roughly speaking, we say that a concept class is heurPAC learnable if there exists a learning algorithm that given $n, s\\in\\mathbb{N}$ and $\\epsilon,\\delta,\\eta\\in(0,1]$ as input, learns all but $\\eta$ fraction of $n$-input target functions represented as $s$-bit strings in the class from passively collected examples and then outputs an $\\epsilon$-close hypothesis with failure probability at most $\\delta$ in polynomial-time in $n$, $s$, $\\epsilon^{-1},\\delta^{-1}$, and $\\eta^{-1}$, where each example is generated according to some example distribution.  First, we establish a positive learnability result. Specifically, we show that a simple Fourier-based algorithm heurPAC learns $\\Omega(\\log n)$-junta functions on the uniform distribution, which is a central open question in the original PAC learning model. Our technical contribution is to introduce the notion of elusive functions that captures hard-to-learn cases and to establish a polynomial relation between the running time and the fraction of such elusive functions. Second, we present clear relations between heurPAC learnability and cryptography. Particularly, we show that for any efficiently evaluated class $\\mathscr{C}$, (1) if $\\mathscr{C}$ is not heurPAC learnable, then an auxiliary-input one-way function (AIOWF) exists; (2) if $\\mathscr{C}$ is not heurPAC learnable on the uniform distribution, then an infinitely-often one-way function (io-OWF) exists. As a corollary, we also present new characterizations for AIOWF and io-OWF based on heurPAC learnability, which is conceptually stronger than the previous ones that are based on average-case learnability for fixed parameters. These results show that our framework might yield heuristic learners with theoretical guarantees for broader classes than the usual PAC learning framework, and any efficiently evaluated class has a potential for such a heuristic learner or a secure cryptographic primitive.

        "abstract": "Adaptive sequential decision making is one of the central challenges in machine learning and artificial intelligence. In such problems, the goal is to design an interactive policy that plans for an action to take, from a finite set of $n$ actions, given some partial observations. It has been shown that in many applications such as active learning, robotics, sequential experimental design, and active detection, the utility function satisfies adaptive submodularity, a notion that generalizes the notion of diminishing returns to policies.  In this paper, we revisit the power of adaptivity in maximizing an adaptive monotone submodular function. We propose an efficient semi adaptive policy that with $O(\\log n \\times\\log k)$ adaptive rounds of observations can achieve an almost tight $1-1/e-\\epsilon$ approximation guarantee with respect to an optimal policy that carries out $k$ actions in a fully sequential manner. To complement our results, we also show that it is impossible to achieve a constant factor approximation with $o(\\log n)$ adaptive rounds. We also extend our result to the case of adaptive stochastic minimum cost coverage where the goal is to reach a desired utility $Q$ with the cheapest policy. We first prove the long-standing conjecture by Golovin and Krause and show that the greedy policy achieves the asymptotically tight logarithmic approximation guarantee.

In such problems, the goal is to design an interactive policy that plans for an action to take, from a finite set of $n$ actions, given some partial observations. It has been shown that in many applications such as active learning, robotics, sequential experimental design, and active detection, the utility function satisfies adaptive submodularity, a notion that generalizes the notion of diminishing returns to policies.  In this paper, we revisit the power of adaptivity in maximizing an adaptive monotone submodular function. We propose an efficient semi adaptive policy that with $O(\\log n \\times\\log k)$ adaptive rounds of observations can achieve an almost tight $1-1/e-\\epsilon$ approximation guarantee with respect to an optimal policy that carries out $k$ actions in a fully sequential manner. To complement our results, we also show that it is impossible to achieve a constant factor approximation with $o(\\log n)$ adaptive rounds. We also extend our result to the case of adaptive stochastic minimum cost coverage where the goal is to reach a desired utility $Q$ with the cheapest policy. We first prove the long-standing conjecture by Golovin and Krause and show that the greedy policy achieves the asymptotically tight logarithmic approximation guarantee. We then propose a semi adaptive policy that provides the same guarantee in polylogarithmic adaptive rounds through a similar information-parallelism scheme. Our results shrink the adaptivity gap in adaptive submodular maximization by an exponential factor.}\n}",

        "abstract": "The explosive growth of easily-accessible unlabeled data has lead to growing interest in \\emph{active learning}, a paradigm in which data-hungry learning algorithms adaptively select informative examples in order to lower prohibitively expensive labeling costs. Unfortunately, in standard worst-case models of learning, the active setting often provides no improvement over non-adaptive algorithms. To combat this, a series of recent works have considered a model in which the learner may ask \\emph{enriched} queries beyond labels. While such models have seen success in drastically lowering label costs, they tend to come at the expense of requiring large amounts of memory. In this work, we study what families of classifiers can be learned in \\emph{bounded memory}.

Unfortunately, in standard worst-case models of learning, the active setting often provides no improvement over non-adaptive algorithms. To combat this, a series of recent works have considered a model in which the learner may ask \\emph{enriched} queries beyond labels. While such models have seen success in drastically lowering label costs, they tend to come at the expense of requiring large amounts of memory.

The best-known previous result on $\\ell_2$ estimation error for this problem is $O\\left( \\frac{s\\log\\left( {d}/{s}\\right)}{n2^b}\\right)$. Surprisingly, we show that when sample size $n$ exceeds a minimum threshold $n^*(s, d, b)$, we can achieve an $\\ell_2$ estimation error of $O\\left( \\frac{s}{n2^b}\\right)$. This implies that when $n>n^*(s, d, b)$ the convergence rate does not depend on the ambient dimension $d$ and is the same as knowing the support of the distribution beforehand.\nWe next ask the question: ``what is the minimum $n^*(s, d, b)$ that allows dimension-free convergence?'.  To upper bound $n^*(s, d, b)$, we develop novel localization schemes to accurately and efficiently localize the unknown support.

In this work, we formalize these settings and study the problem of learning from such coarse data.  Instead of observing the actual labels from a set $\\mathcal{Z}$, we observe coarse labels corresponding to a partition of $\\mathcal{Z}$ (or a mixture of partitions).  Our main algorithmic result is that essentially any problem learnable from fine grained labels can also be learned efficiently when the coarse data are sufficiently informative.  We obtain our result through a generic reduction for answering Statistical Queries (SQ) over fine grained labels given only coarse labels.  The number of coarse labels required depends polynomially on the information distortion due to coarsening and the number of fine labels $|\\mathcal{Z}|$.

In this work, we formalize these settings and study the problem of learning from such coarse data.  Instead of observing the actual labels from a set $\\mathcal{Z}$, we observe coarse labels corresponding to a partition of $\\mathcal{Z}$ (or a mixture of partitions).  Our main algorithmic result is that essentially any problem learnable from fine grained labels can also be learned efficiently when the coarse data are sufficiently informative.  We obtain our result through a generic reduction for answering Statistical Queries (SQ) over fine grained labels given only coarse labels.  The number of coarse labels required depends polynomially on the information distortion due to coarsening and the number of fine labels $|\\mathcal{Z}|$.

        "abstract": "Despite many applications, dimensionality reduction in the $\\ell_1$-norm is much less understood than in the Euclidean norm. We give two new oblivious dimensionality reduction techniques for the $\\ell_1$-norm which improve exponentially over prior ones:\n- We design a distribution over random matrices $S \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r \\times n}$, where $r = 2^{\\textrm{poly}(d/(\\varepsilon \\delta))}$, such that given any matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$, with probability at least $1-\\delta$, simultaneously for all $x$, $\\|SAx\\|_1 = (1 \\pm \\varepsilon)\\|Ax\\|_1$. Note that $S$ is linear, does not depend on $A$, and maps $\\ell_1$ into $\\ell_1$. Our distribution provides an exponential improvement on the previous best known map of Wang and Woodruff (SODA, 2019), which required $r = 2^{2^{\\Omega(d)}}$, even for constant $\\varepsilon$ and $\\delta$.

As we show, this assumption allows us to surpass the current state of the art, and prove hardness of various basic problems, with no hardness results to date.  Our results include: hardness of learning shallow ReLU neural networks under the Gaussian distribution and other distributions; hardness of learning intersections of $\\omega(1)$ halfspaces, DNF formulas with $\\omega(1)$ terms, and ReLU networks with $\\omega(1)$ hidden neurons; hardness of weakly learning deterministic finite automata under the uniform distribution; hardness of weakly learning depth-$3$ Boolean circuits under the uniform distribution, as well as distribution-specific hardness results for learning DNF formulas and intersections of halfspaces.

In this paper we study the task of approximate recovery, in which we tolerate having a small number of incorrectly classified items.  One of the most well-known, optimal, and easy to implement testing procedures is the non-adaptive Bernoulli group testing, where all tests are conducted in parallel, and each item is chosen to be part of any certain test independently with some fixed probability. In this setting, there is an observed gap between the number of tests above which recovery is information theoretically possible, and the number of tests required by the currently best known efficient algorithms to succeed. In this paper we seek to understand whether this computational-statistical gap can be closed. Our main contributions are the following: 1.Often times such gaps are explained by a phase transition in the landscape of the solution space of the problem (an Overlap Gap Property (OGP) phase transition). We provide first moment evidence that, perhaps surprisingly, such a phase transition does not take place throughout the regime for which recovery is information theoretically possible. This fact suggests that the model is in fact amenable to local search algorithms.  2. We prove the complete absence of \u201cbad\u201d local minima for a part of the \u201chard\u201d regime, a fact which implies an improvement over known theoretical results on the performance of efficient algorithms for approximate recovery without false-negatives.  3. Finally, motivated by the evidence for the abscence for the OGP, we present extensive simulations that strongly suggest that a very simple local algorithm known as Glauber Dynamics does indeed succeed, and can be used to efficiently implement the well-known (theoretically optimal) Smallest Satisfying Set (SSS) estimator. Given that practical algorithms for this task utilize Branch and Bound and Linear Programming relaxation techniques, our finding could potentially be of practical interest.",

However, the implicit regularization in nonlinear neural networks is still poorly understood, especially for regression losses such as the square loss. Perhaps surprisingly, we prove that even for a single ReLU neuron, it is impossible to characterize the implicit regularization with the square loss by any explicit function of the model parameters (although on the positive side, we show it can be characterized approximately). For one hidden-layer networks, we prove a similar result, where in general it is impossible to characterize implicit regularization properties in this manner, except for the \u201cbalancedness\u201d property identified in Du et al.

However, the implicit regularization in nonlinear neural networks is still poorly understood, especially for regression losses such as the square loss. Perhaps surprisingly, we prove that even for a single ReLU neuron, it is impossible to characterize the implicit regularization with the square loss by any explicit function of the model parameters (although on the positive side, we show it can be characterized approximately). For one hidden-layer networks, we prove a similar result, where in general it is impossible to characterize implicit regularization properties in this manner, except for the \u201cbalancedness\u201d property identified in Du et al. (2018).

Our main contribution is providing upper bounds on the generalization error that depend on local statistics of the stochastic gradients evaluated along the path of iterates calculated by SGD.

        "abstract": "Observations from dynamical systems often exhibit irregularities, such as censoring, where values are recorded only if they fall within a certain range. Censoring is ubiquitous in practice, due to saturating sensors, limit-of-detection effects, image frame effects, and combined with the temporal dependencies within the data, makes the task of system identification particularly challenging.  In light of recent developments on learning linear dynamical systems (LDSs), and on censored statistics with independent data, we revisit the decades-old problem of learning an LDS, from censored observations (Lee and Maddala (1985), Zeger and Brookmeyer (1986)). Here, the learner observes the state x_t \\in R^d if and only if x_t belongs to some set S_t _x0012_\\in R^d. We develop the first computationally and statistically efficient algorithm for learning the system, assuming only oracle to the sets St. Our algorithm, Stochastic Online Newton with Switching Gradients, is a novel second-order method that builds on the Online Newton Step (ONS) of Hazan et al. (2007). Our Switching-Gradient scheme does not always use (stochastic) gradients of the function we want to optimize, which we call censor-aware function. Instead, in each iteration, it performs a simple test to decide whether to use the censor-aware, or another censor-oblivious function, for getting a stochastic gradient.  In our analysis, we consider a \u201cgeneric\u201d Online Newton method, which uses arbitrary vectors instead of gradients, and we prove an error-bound for it. This can be used to appropriately design these vectors, Leading to our Switching-Gradient scheme. This framework significantly deviates from the recent long line of works on censored statistics (e.g, Daskalakis et al. (2018); Kontonis et al. (2019); Daskalakis et al. (2019), which apply Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and their analysis reduces to establishing conditions for off-the-shelf SGD-bounds. Our approach enables to relax these conditions, and gives rise to phenomena that might appear counterintuitive, given the previous works. Specifically, our method makes progress even when the current \u201csurvival probability\u201d is exponentially small.

Suppose there are two arms, one predictable and one risky, and two players, Alice and Bob. In every round, each player pulls an arm, receives the resulting reward, and observes the choice of the other player but not their reward. Alice\u2019s utility is $\\Gamma_A + \\lambda \\Gamma_B$ (and similarly for Bob), where $\\Gamma_A$ is Alice\u2019s total reward and $\\lambda \\in [-1, 1]$ is a cooperation parameter. At $\\lambda = -1$ the players are competing in a zero-sum game, at $\\lambda = 1$, their interests are aligned, and at $\\lambda = 0$, they are neutral: each player\u2019s utility is their own reward. The model is related to the economics literature on strategic experimentation, where usually players observe each other\u2019s rewards.

        "abstract": "Many real-world data sets are sparse or almost sparse. One method to measure this for a matrix $A\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$ is the \\emph{numerical sparsity}, denoted $\\mathsf{ns}(A)$, defined as the minimum $k\\geq 1$ such that $\\|a\\|_1/\\|a\\|_2 \\leq \\sqrt{k}$ for every row and every column $a$ of $A$. This measure of $a$ is smooth and is clearly only smaller than the number of non-zeros in the row/column $a$.  The seminal work of Achlioptas and McSherry (2007) has put forward the question of approximating an input matrix $A$ by entrywise sampling. More precisely, the goal is to quickly compute a sparse matrix $\\tilde{A}$ satisfying $\\|A - \\tilde{A}\\|_2 \\leq \\epsilon \\|A\\|_2$ (i.e., additive spectral approximation) given an error parameter $\\epsilon>0$. The known schemes sample and rescale a small fraction of entries from $A$.  We propose a scheme that sparsifies an almost-sparse matrix $A$ \u2014 it produces a matrix $\\tilde{A}$ with $O(\\epsilon^{-2}\\mathsf{ns}(A) \\cdot n\\ln n)$ non-zero entries with high probability. We also prove that this upper bound on $\\mathsf{nnz}(\\tilde{A})$ is \\emph{tight} up to logarithmic factors. Moreover, our upper bound improves when the spectrum of $A$ decays quickly (roughly replacing $n$ with the stable rank of $A$). Our scheme can be implemented in time $O(\\mathsf{nnz}(A))$ when $\\|A\\|_2$ is given. Previously, a similar upper bound was obtained by Achlioptas et al. (2013), but only for a restricted class of inputs that does not even include symmetric or covariance matrices. Finally, we demonstrate two applications of these sampling techniques, to faster approximate matrix multiplication, and to ridge regression by using sparse preconditioners.",

Most of the existing works in the literature of private convex optimization focus on the Euclidean (i.e., $\\ell_2$) setting, where the loss is assumed to be Lipschitz (and possibly smooth) w.r.t. the $\\ell_2$ norm over a constraint set with bounded $\\ell_2$ diameter.

The generative model provides a restricted, \u201clocal\u201d access to the MDP: The planner can ask for random transitions from previously returned states and arbitrary actions, and the features are also only accessible for the states that are encountered in this process. As opposed to previous work (e.g. Lattimore et al. (2020)) where linear realizability of all policies was assumed, we consider the significantly relaxed assumption of a single linearly realizable (deterministic) policy. A recent lower bound by Weisz et al. (2020) established that the related problem when the action-value function of the optimal policy is linearly realizable requires an exponential number of queries, either in $H$ (the horizon of the MDP) or $d$ (the dimension of the feature mapping). Their construction crucially relies on having an exponentially large action set. In contrast, in this work, we establish that $\\poly(H,d)$ planning is possible with state value function realizability whenever the action set has a constant size. In particular, we present the TensorPlan algorithm which uses $\\poly((dH/\\delta)^A)$ simulator queries to find a $\\delta$-optimal policy relative to any deterministic policy for which the value function is linearly realizable with some bounded parameter (with a known bound). This is the first algorithm to give a polynomial query complexity guarantee using only linear-realizability of a single competing value function. Whether the computation cost is similarly bounded remains an interesting open question. We also extend the upper bound to the near-realizable case and to the infinite-horizon discounted MDP setup. The upper bounds are complemented by a lower bound which states that in the infinite-horizon episodic setting, planners that achieve constant suboptimality need exponentially many queries, either in the dimension or the number of actions.",

        "abstract": "Which classes can be learned properly in the online model? \u2014 that is, by an algorithm that on each round uses a predictor from the concept class. While there are simple and natural cases where improper learning is useful and even necessary, it is natural to ask how complex must the improper predictors be in such cases.  Can one always achieve nearly optimal mistake/regret bounds using \"simple\" predictors?  In this work, we give a complete characterization of when this is possible, thus settling an open problem which has been studied since the pioneering works of Angluin (1987) and Littlestone (1988).  More precisely, given any concept class C and any hypothesis class H, we provide nearly tight bounds (up to a log factor) on the optimal mistake bounds for online learning C using predictors from H.  Our bound yields an exponential improvement over the previously best known bound by Chase and Freitag (2020).  As applications, we give constructive proofs showing that (i) in the realizable setting, a near-optimal mistake bound (up to a constant factor) can be attained by a sparse majority-vote of proper predictors, and (ii) in the agnostic setting, a near-optimal regret bound (up to a log factor) can be attained by a randomized proper algorithm.  The latter was proven non-constructively by Rakhlin, Sridharan, and Tewari (2015).  It was also achieved by constructive but improper algorithms proposed by Ben-David, Pal, and Shalev-Shwartz (2009) and Rakhlin, Shamir, and Sridharan (2012).  A technical ingredient of our proof which may be of independent interest is a generalization of the celebrated Minimax Theorem (von Neumann, 1928) for binary zero-sum games with arbitrary action-sets: a simple game which fails to satisfy Minimax is \"Guess the Larger Number\".  In this game, each player picks a natural number and the player who picked the larger number wins.  Equivalently, the payoff matrix of this game is infinite triangular.  We show that this is the only obstruction: if the payoff matrix does not contain triangular submatrices of unbounded sizes then the Minimax theorem is satisfied.  This generalizes von Neumann\u2019s Minimax Theorem by removing requirements of finiteness (or compactness) of the action-sets, and moreover it captures precisely the types of games of interest in online learning: namely, Littlestone games.",

We provide a near linear-time variant that achieves an approximation ratio depending on the minimal (across edges) effective resistance of the graph. We connect our results to the graph partition approximation method and thus provide a unified perspective.}\n}",

While it is inspired by uniform convergence in statistical learning, our approach additionally incorporates a correction term to avoid unnecessary variance due to outliers.

Here the unknown matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{c \\times d}$ is constrained to be of rank $k$ as it results in a significant parameter reduction of the solution when $c$ and $d$ are large.

We give the first randomized algorithms for this problem running in time $$(nnz{(A)} + nnz{(B)} + c^2) \\cdot k/\\varepsilon^{1.5} + (n+d)k^2/\\epsilon + c^{\\omega},$$ up to a polylogarithmic factor involving condition numbers, matrix dimensions, and dependence on $1/\\varepsilon$. Here $nnz{(M)}$ denotes the number of non-zero entries of a matrix $M$, and $\\omega$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication. As both (1) spectral low rank approximation ($A = B$) and (2) linear system solving ($n = c$ and $d = 1$) are special cases, our time cannot be improved by more than a $1/\\varepsilon$ factor (up to polylogarithmic factors) without a major breakthrough in linear algebra. Interestingly, known techniques for low rank approximation, such as alternating minimization or sketch-and-solve, provably fail for this problem. Instead, our algorithm uses an existential characterization of a solution, together with Krylov methods, low degree polynomial approximation, and sketching-based preconditioning.",

Furthermore, the limiting dynamics are governed by a Volterra integral equation. This model predicts that SGD undergoes a phase transition at an explicitly given critical stepsize that ultimately affects its convergence rate, which is also verified experimentally. Finally, when input data is isotropic, we provide explicit expressions for the dynamics and average-case convergence rates (i.e., the complexity of an algorithm averaged over all possible inputs). These rates show significant improvement over classical worst-case complexities.}\n}",

However, not all functions are interesting from a practical viewpoint: functions of interest usually have a polynomially-bounded Lipschitz constant, and can be computed efficiently. We call functions that satisfy these conditions \u201cbenign\u201d, and explore the benefits of size and depth for approximation of benign functions with ReLU networks.  As we show, this problem is more challenging than the corresponding problem for non-benign functions.  We give complexity-theoretic barriers to showing depth-lower-bounds: Proving existence of a benign function that cannot be approximated by polynomial-sized networks of depth $4$ would settle longstanding open problems in computational complexity. It implies that beyond depth $4$ there is a barrier to showing depth-separation for benign functions, even between networks of constant depth and networks of nonconstant depth.  We also study size-separation, namely, whether there are benign functions that can be approximated with networks of size $O(s(d))$, but not with networks of size $O(s\u2019(d))$. We show a complexity-theoretic barrier to proving such results beyond size $O(d\\log^2(d))$, but also show an explicit benign function, that can be approximated with networks of size $O(d)$ and not with networks of size $o(d/\\log d)$. For approximation in the $L_\\infty$ sense we achieve such separation already between size $O(d)$ and size $o(d)$.  Moreover, we show superpolynomial size lower bounds and barriers to such lower bounds, depending on the assumptions on the function.

        "abstract": "For a tall $n\\times d$ matrix $A$ and a random $m\\times n$ sketching matrix $S$, the sketched estimate of the inverse covariance matrix $(A^\\top A)^{-1}$ is typically biased: $E[(\\tilde A^\\top\\tilde A)^{-1}]\\ne(A^\\top A)^{-1}$, where $\\tilde A=SA$. This phenomenon, which we call inversion bias, arises, e.g., in statistics and distributed optimization, when averaging multiple independently constructed estimates of quantities that depend on the inverse covariance. We develop a framework for analyzing inversion bias, based on our proposed concept of an $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-unbiased estimator for random matrices. We show that when the sketching matrix $S$ is dense and has i.i.d. sub-gaussian entries, then after simple rescaling, the estimator $(\\frac m{m-d}\\tilde A^\\top\\tilde A)^{-1}$ is $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-unbiased for $(A^\\top A)^{-1}$ with a sketch of size $m=O(d+\\sqrt d/\\epsilon)$. This implies that for $m=O(d)$, the inversion bias of this estimator is $O(1/\\sqrt d)$, which is much smaller than the $\\Theta(1)$ approximation error obtained as a consequence of the subspace embedding guarantee for sub-gaussian sketches. We then propose a new sketching technique, called LEverage Score Sparsified (LESS) embeddings, which uses ideas from both data-oblivious sparse embeddings as well as data-aware leverage-based row sampling methods, to get $\\epsilon$ inversion bias for sketch size $m=O(d\\log d+\\sqrt d/\\epsilon)$ in time $O(\\text{nnz}(A)\\log n+md^2)$, where nnz is the number of non-zeros. The key techniques enabling our analysis include an extension of a classical inequality of Bai and Silverstein for random quadratic forms, which we call the Restricted Bai-Silverstein inequality; and anti-concentration of the Binomial distribution via the Paley-Zygmund inequality, which we use to prove a lower bound showing that leverage score sampling sketches generally do not achieve small inversion bias.",

Our evidence takes the form of a \"computationally-quiet planting\": we construct a distribution of d-regular graphs that has significantly smaller chromatic number than a typical regular graph drawn uniformly at random, while providing evidence that these two distributions are indistinguishable by a large class of algorithms.

Our evidence for computational hardness of distinguishing two distributions is based on three different heuristics: stability of belief propagation, the local statistics hierarchy, and the low-degree likelihood ratio.

For each problem we provide polynomial time algorithms that given $n$ i.i.d. samples from a discrete distribution, achieve an approximation factor of $\\exp\\left(-O(\\sqrt{n} \\log n) \\right)$, improving upon the previous best-known bound achievable in polynomial time of $\\exp(-O(n^{2/3} \\log n))$ (Charikar, Shiragur and Sidford, 2019). Through the work of Acharya, Das, Orlitsky and Suresh (2016), this implies a polynomial time universal estimator for symmetric properties of discrete distributions in a broader range of error parameter.  To obtain our results on PML we establish new connections between PML and the well-studied Bethe and Sinkhorn approximations to the permanent (Vontobel, 2012 and 2014). It is known that the PML objective is proportional to the permanent of a certain Vandermonde matrix (Vontobel, 2012) with $\\sqrt{n}$ distinct columns, i.e. with non-negative rank at most $\\sqrt{n}$. This allows us to show that the convex approximation to computing PML distributions studied in (Charikar, Shiragur and Sidford, 2019) is governed, in part, by the quality of Sinkhorn approximations to the permanent. We show that both Bethe and Sinkhorn permanents are $\\exp(O(k \\log(N/k)))$ approximations to the permanent of $N \\times N$ matrices with non-negative rank at most $k$. This improves upon the previous known bounds of $\\exp(O(N))$ and combining these insights with careful rounding of the convex relaxation yields our results.",

On the other hand, we establish that the objective remains one-point strongly convex in \\emph{most} directions (suitably defined), and show an optimization guarantee under this property. For the non-global minima, we prove that adding even just a single neuron will turn a non-global minimum into a saddle point.

        "abstract": "We revisit one of the most basic and widely applicable techniques in the literature of differential privacy \u2013 the sparse vector technique [Dwork et al., STOC 2009]. This simple algorithm privately tests whether the value of a given query on a database is close to what we expect it to be. It allows to ask an unbounded number of queries as long as the answer is close to what we expect, and halts following the first query for which this is not the case.  We suggest an alternative, equally simple, algorithm that can continue testing queries as long as any single individual does not contribute to the answer of too many queries whose answer deviates substantially form what we expect.

We present an algorithm for this problem with improved error guarantees over what can be obtained using existing techniques.

It allows to ask an unbounded number of queries as long as the answer is close to what we expect, and halts following the first query for which this is not the case.
