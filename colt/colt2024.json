While regret minimization under subgaussian or bounded rewards has been widely studied, learning with heavy-tailed distributions only gained popularity over the last decade. In this paper, we consider the setting in which the reward distributions have finite absolute raw moments of maximum order $1+\\epsilon$, uniformly bounded by a constant $u<+\\infty$, for some $\\epsilon \\in (0,1]$. In this setting, we study the regret minimization problem when $\\epsilon$ and $u$ are unknown to the learner and it has to adapt. First, we show that adaptation comes at a cost and derive two negative results proving that the same regret guarantees of the non-adaptive case cannot be achieved with no further assumptions. Then, we devise and analyze a fully data-driven trimmed mean estimator and propose a novel adaptive regret minimization algorithm, \\texttt{AdaR-UCB}, that leverages such an estimator.

The vector can be interpreted as the incident vector corresponding to $n$ items out of which $k$ items are \\emph{defective}. The \\emph{quantitative group testing} (QGT) problem aims at learning this binary feature vector by queries on subsets of the items that return the total number of defective items. We consider this problem under the \\emph{non-adaptive} scenario where the queries on subsets are designed collectively and can be executed in parallel. Most of the existing efficient non-adaptive algorithms for the sublinear regime where $k = n^\\alpha$ with $0 < \\alpha < 1$ fall short of the information-theoretic lower bound, with a multiplicative gap of $\\log k$. Recently, a near-optimal non-adaptive algorithm with a decoding complexity of $O(n^3)$ closed this gap. In this work, we present a concatenated construction method yielding a non-adaptive algorithm with a decoding complexity of $O(n^{2\\alpha} + n \\log^2 n)$. The probability of decoding failure is analyzed by establishing a connection between the QGT problem and the so-called \\emph{balls into bins} problem. Our algorithm reduces the gap between the information-theoretic and computational bound for the number of required queries/tests from $\\log k$ to $\\log \\log k$. This narrows the gap in the number of tests for non-adaptive algorithms within the class of algorithms with $o(n^2)$ decoding complexity. Moreover, although our algorithm exhibits a $\\log \\log k$ gap in terms of the number of tests, it is surpassed by the existing asymptotically optimal construction only in scenarios where $k$ is exceptionally large for moderate values of $\\alpha$, such as $k > 10^{27}$ for $\\alpha = 0.7$, thereby highlighting the practical applicability of our proposed concatenated construction.",

Such matrices are of particular interest in the study of tensor completion, where they arise from the unfolding of a low-rank tensor. In the case where the sampling probability is $\\frac{d}{\\sqrt{mn}}$, we propose a new spectral algorithm for recovering the singular values and left singular vectors of the original matrix $M$ based on a variant of the standard non-backtracking operator of a suitably defined bipartite weighted random graph, which we call a \\textit{non-backtracking wedge operator}. When $d$ is above a Kesten-Stigum-type sampling threshold, our algorithm recovers a correlated version of the singular value decomposition of $M$ with quantifiable error bounds. This is the first result in the regime of bounded $d$ for weak recovery and the first for weak consistency when $d\\to\\infty$ arbitrarily slowly without any polylog factors.

Such matrices are of particular interest in the study of tensor completion, where they arise from the unfolding of a low-rank tensor. In the case where the sampling probability is $\\frac{d}{\\sqrt{mn}}$, we propose a new spectral algorithm for recovering the singular values and left singular vectors of the original matrix $M$ based on a variant of the standard non-backtracking operator of a suitably defined bipartite weighted random graph, which we call a \\textit{non-backtracking wedge operator}. When $d$ is above a Kesten-Stigum-type sampling threshold, our algorithm recovers a correlated version of the singular value decomposition of $M$ with quantifiable error bounds. This is the first result in the regime of bounded $d$ for weak recovery and the first for weak consistency when $d\\to\\infty$ arbitrarily slowly without any polylog factors.

Our main result is that accurate posterior inference about the root vertex given the leaves \\emph{is} possible when the adversary is constrained to make corruptions at a $\\rho$-fraction of randomly-chosen leaf vertices, so long as the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds $O(\\log d)$ and $\\rho \\leq c \\varepsilon$ for some universal $c > 0$. Since inference becomes information-theoretically impossible when $\\rho \\gg \\varepsilon$, this amounts to an information-theoretically optimal fraction of corruptions, up to a constant multiplicative factor. Furthermore, we show that the canonical belief propagation algorithm performs this inference.}\n}",

        "abstract": "Let $f(\\theta, X_1),$ $ \u2026,$ $ f(\\theta, X_n)$ be a sequence of random elements, where $f$ is a fixed scalar function, $X_1, \u2026, X_n$ are independent random variables (data), and $\\theta$ is a random parameter distributed according to some data-dependent \\emph{posterior} distribution $P_n$. In this paper, we consider the problem of proving concentration inequalities to estimate the mean of the sequence. An example of such a problem is the estimation of the generalization error of some predictor trained by a stochastic algorithm, such as a neural network, where $f$ is a loss function. Classically, this problem is approached through a \\emph{PAC-Bayes} analysis where, in addition to the posterior, we choose a \\emph{prior} distribution which captures our belief about the inductive bias of the learning problem. Then, the key quantity in PAC-Bayes concentration bounds is a divergence that captures the \\emph{complexity} of the learning problem where the de facto standard choice is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, the tightness of this choice has rarely been  questioned.   In this paper, we challenge the tightness of the KL-divergence-based bounds by showing that it is possible to achieve a strictly tighter bound. In particular, we demonstrate new \\emph{high-probability} PAC-Bayes bounds with a novel and \\emph{better-than-KL} divergence that is inspired by Zhang et al. (2022). Our proof is inspired by recent advances in regret analysis of gambling algorithms, and its use to derive concentration inequalities. Our result is first-of-its-kind in that existing PAC-Bayes bounds with non-KL divergences are not known to be strictly better than KL. Thus, we believe our work marks the first step towards identifying optimal rates of PAC-Bayes bounds.",

        "abstract": "When we have a univariate distribution that is symmetric around its mean, the mean can be estimated with a rate (sample complexity) much faster than $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$ in many cases. For example, given univariate random variables $Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n$ distributed uniformly on $[\\theta_0 - c, \\theta_0 + c]$, the sample midrange $\\frac{Y_{(n)}+Y_{(1)}}{2}$ maximizes likelihood and has expected error $\\mathbb{E}\\bigl| \\theta_0 - \\frac{Y_{(n)}+Y_{(1)}}{2} \\bigr| \\leq 2c/n$, which is optimal and much lower than the error rate $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$ of the sample mean. What the optimal rate is depends on the distribution and it is generally attained by the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). However, MLE requires exact knowledge of the underlying distribution; if the underlying distribution is \\emph{unknown}, it is an open question whether an estimator can adapt to the optimal rate. In this paper, we propose an estimator of the symmetric mean $\\theta_0$ with the following properties: it requires no knowledge of the underlying distribution; it has a rate no worse than $1/\\sqrt{n}$ in all cases (assuming a finite second moment) and, when the underlying distribution is compactly supported, our estimator can attain a rate of $n^{-\\frac{1}{{\\alpha}}}$ up to polylog factors, where the rate parameter $\\alpha$ can take on any value in $(0, 2]$ and depends on the moments of the underlying distribution. Our estimator is formed by minimizing the $L_\\gamma$-loss with respect to the data, for a power $\\gamma \\geq 2$ chosen in a data-driven way \u2013 by minimizing a criterion motivated by the asymptotic variance. Our approach can be directly applied to the regression setting where $\\theta_0$ is a function of observed features and motivates the use of $L_\\gamma$ loss function with a data-driven $\\gamma$ in certain settings.",

However, MLE requires exact knowledge of the underlying distribution; if the underlying distribution is \\emph{unknown}, it is an open question whether an estimator can adapt to the optimal rate. In this paper, we propose an estimator of the symmetric mean $\\theta_0$ with the following properties: it requires no knowledge of the underlying distribution; it has a rate no worse than $1/\\sqrt{n}$ in all cases (assuming a finite second moment) and, when the underlying distribution is compactly supported, our estimator can attain a rate of $n^{-\\frac{1}{{\\alpha}}}$ up to polylog factors, where the rate parameter $\\alpha$ can take on any value in $(0, 2]$ and depends on the moments of the underlying distribution. Our estimator is formed by minimizing the $L_\\gamma$-loss with respect to the data, for a power $\\gamma \\geq 2$ chosen in a data-driven way \u2013 by minimizing a criterion motivated by the asymptotic variance. Our approach can be directly applied to the regression setting where $\\theta_0$ is a function of observed features and motivates the use of $L_\\gamma$ loss function with a data-driven $\\gamma$ in certain settings. }\n}",

As such, they encompass a broad class of statistical inference tasks, and provide a rich template to study statistical and computational trade-offs in the high-dimensional regime.  While the information-theoretic sample complexity to recover the hidden direction is linear in the dimension $d$, we show that computationally efficient algorithms, both within the Statistical Query (SQ) and the Low-Degree Polynomial (LDP) framework, necessarily require $\\Omega(d^{k^\\star/2})$ samples, where $k^\\star$ is a \u201cgenerative\u201d exponent associated with the model that we explicitly characterize. Moreover, we show that this sample complexity is also sufficient, by establishing matching upper bounds using a partial-trace algorithm.

While the information-theoretic sample complexity to recover the hidden direction is linear in the dimension $d$, we show that computationally efficient algorithms, both within the Statistical Query (SQ) and the Low-Degree Polynomial (LDP) framework, necessarily require $\\Omega(d^{k^\\star/2})$ samples, where $k^\\star$ is a \u201cgenerative\u201d exponent associated with the model that we explicitly characterize.

        "abstract": "We introduce a novel concept of convergence for Markovian processes within Orlicz spaces, extending beyond the conventional approach associated with $L_p$ spaces. After showing that Markovian operators are contractive in Orlicz spaces, our technical contribution is an upper bound on their contraction coefficient, which admits a closed-form expression. The bound is tight in some settings, and it recovers well-known results, such as the connection between contraction and ergodicity, ultra-mixing and Doeblin\u2019s minorisation. Moreover, we can define a notion of convergence of Markov processes in Orlicz spaces, which depends on the corresponding contraction coefficient.  The key novelty comes from duality considerations: the convergence of a Markovian process determined by $K$ depends on the contraction coefficient of its dual $K^\\star$, which can in turn be bounded by considering appropriate nested norms of densities of $K^\\star$ with respect to the stationary measure. Our approach stands out as the first of its kind, as it does not rely on the existence of a spectral gap. Specialising our approach to $L_p$ spaces leads to a significant improvement upon classical Riesz-Thorin\u2019s interpolation methods. We present the following applications of the proposed framework: \\begin{enumerate} \\item Tighter bounds on the mixing time of Markovian processes: one can relate the contraction coefficient of the dual operator to the mixing time of the corresponding Markov chain regardless of the norm chosen. Consequently, our tighter bound on the contraction coefficient implies a tighter bound on the mixing time. We offer a result that provides an intuitive understanding of what it means to be close in a specific norm (relating the probability of any event with the probability of the same event under the stationary measure $\\pi$ and a $\\psi$-Orlicz/Amemiya-norm). We then focus on $L_p$ norms and show that asking for a bounded norm with larger $p$ guarantees a faster decay in the probability. This is particularly relevant for exponentially decaying probabilities under $\\pi$. Moreover, by exploiting the flexibility offered by Orlicz spaces, we can tackle settings where the stationary distribution is heavy-tailed, a severely under-studied setup. \\item Improved concentration bounds for MCMC methods leading to improved lower bounds on the burn-in period: by leveraging $L_p$-norms with large $p$ and our results on the contraction coefficient, similar to the approach undertaken for the mixing times, we can provide improved exponential concentration bounds for MCMC methods. \\item Improved concentration bounds for sequences of Markovian random variables: we show how our results can be used to outperform existing bounds based on a change of measure technique for random variables with a Markovian dependence. In particular, we can prove exponential concentration in new settings (inaccessible to earlier approaches) and improve the rate in others. \\end{enumerate}",

        "abstract": "Graph alignment refers to the task of finding the vertex correspondence between two correlated graphs of $n$ vertices. Extensive study has been done on polynomial-time algorithms for the graph alignment problem under the Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi graph pair model, where the two graphs are Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi graphs with edge probability $q_\\mathrm{u}$, correlated under certain vertex correspondence. To achieve exact recovery of the correspondence, all existing algorithms at least require the edge correlation coefficient $\\rho_\\mathrm{u}$ between the two graphs to be \\emph{non-vanishing} as $n\\rightarrow\\infty$. Moreover, it is conjectured that no polynomial-time algorithm can achieve exact recovery under vanishing edge correlation $\\rho_\\mathrm{u}<1/\\mathrm{polylog}(n)$.

For gradient descent (GD), stable convergence is possible only to minima that are sufficiently flat w.r.t. the step size, and those have been linked with favorable properties of the trained model. However, while the stability threshold of GD is well-known, to date, no explicit expression has been derived for the exact threshold of stochastic GD (SGD). In this paper, we derive such a closed-form expression. Specifically, we provide an explicit condition on the step size that is both necessary and sufficient for the linear stability of SGD in the mean square sense. Our analysis sheds light on the precise role of the batch size B. In particular, we show that the stability threshold is monotonically non-decreasing in the batch size, which means that reducing the batch size can only decrease stability. Furthermore, we show that SGD\u2019s stability threshold is equivalent to that of a mixture process which takes in each iteration a full batch gradient step w.p. 1-p, and a single sample gradient step w.p. $p$, where $p \\approx 1/B$. This indicates that even with moderate batch sizes, SGD\u2019s stability threshold is very close to that of GD\u2019s. We also prove simple necessary conditions for linear stability, which depend on the batch size, and are easier to compute than the precise threshold.

This constitutes the first parallel sampling algorithms with TV distance guarantees.

Specifically,  DMC follows the reverse SDE of a diffusion process that transforms the target distribution to the standard Gaussian, utilizing a non-parametric score estimation. However, the original DMC algorithm encountered high gradient complexity, resulting in an exponential dependency on the error tolerance $\\epsilon$ of the obtained samples. In this paper, we demonstrate that the high complexity of the original DMC algorithm originates from its redundant design of score estimation, and proposed a more efficient DMC algorithm, called RS-DMC, based on a novel recursive score estimation method. In particular, we first divide the entire diffusion process into multiple segments and then formulate the score estimation step (at any time step) as a series of interconnected mean estimation and sampling subproblems accordingly, which are correlated in a recursive manner. Importantly, we show that with a proper design of the segment decomposition, all sampling subproblems will only need to tackle a strongly log-concave distribution, which can be very efficient to solve using the standard sampler (e.g., Langevin Monte Carlo) with a provably rapid convergence rate. As a result, we prove that the gradient complexity of RS-DMC exhibits merely a quasi-polynomial dependency on $\\epsilon$. This finding is highly unexpected as it substantially enhances the prevailing belief of the necessity for exponential gradient complexity in all prior works such as Huang et al. (2023).

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of estimating the spectral density of a normalized graph adjacency matrix. Concretely, given an undirected graph $G = (V, E, w)$ with $n$ nodes and positive edge weights $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^{E}_{> 0}$, the goal is to return eigenvalue estimates $\\widehat{\\lambda}_1 \\le \\cdots\\le \\widehat{\\lambda}_n$ such that \\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i\\in\\{1,\\ldots, n\\}}|\\widehat{\\lambda}_i-\\lambda_i(N_G)|\\le \\varepsilon, \\end{align*} where ${\\lambda}_1(N_G)\\le \\cdots\\le{\\lambda}_n(N_G)$ are the eigenvalues of $G$\u2019s normalized adjacency matrix, $N_G$. This goal is equivalent to requiring that the Wasserstein-1 distance between the uniform distribution on $\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_n$ and the uniform distribution on $\\widehat{\\lambda}_1, \\ldots, \\widehat{\\lambda}_n$ is less than $\\varepsilon$. We provide a randomized algorithm that achieves the guarantee above with $O(n\\varepsilon^{-2})$ queries to a degree and neighbor oracle and in $O(n\\varepsilon^{-3})$ time. This improves on previous state-of-the-art methods, including an $O(n\\varepsilon^{-7})$ time algorithm from [Braverman et al., STOC 2022] and, for sufficiently small $\\varepsilon$, a $2^{O(\\varepsilon^{-1})}$ time method from [Cohen-Steiner et al., KDD 2018]. To achieve this result, we introduce a new notion of graph sparsification, which we call \\emph{nuclear sparsification}. We provide an $O(n\\varepsilon^{-2})$-query and $O(n\\varepsilon^{-2})$-time algorithm for computing $O(n\\varepsilon^{-2})$-sparse nuclear sparsifiers.

Concretely, given an undirected graph $G = (V, E, w)$ with $n$ nodes and positive edge weights $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^{E}_{> 0}$, the goal is to return eigenvalue estimates $\\widehat{\\lambda}_1 \\le \\cdots\\le \\widehat{\\lambda}_n$ such that \\begin{align*} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i\\in\\{1,\\ldots, n\\}}|\\widehat{\\lambda}_i-\\lambda_i(N_G)|\\le \\varepsilon, \\end{align*} where ${\\lambda}_1(N_G)\\le \\cdots\\le{\\lambda}_n(N_G)$ are the eigenvalues of $G$\u2019s normalized adjacency matrix, $N_G$. This goal is equivalent to requiring that the Wasserstein-1 distance between the uniform distribution on $\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_n$ and the uniform distribution on $\\widehat{\\lambda}_1, \\ldots, \\widehat{\\lambda}_n$ is less than $\\varepsilon$. We provide a randomized algorithm that achieves the guarantee above with $O(n\\varepsilon^{-2})$ queries to a degree and neighbor oracle and in $O(n\\varepsilon^{-3})$ time. This improves on previous state-of-the-art methods, including an $O(n\\varepsilon^{-7})$ time algorithm from [Braverman et al., STOC 2022] and, for sufficiently small $\\varepsilon$, a $2^{O(\\varepsilon^{-1})}$ time method from [Cohen-Steiner et al., KDD 2018]. To achieve this result, we introduce a new notion of graph sparsification, which we call \\emph{nuclear sparsification}. We provide an $O(n\\varepsilon^{-2})$-query and $O(n\\varepsilon^{-2})$-time algorithm for computing $O(n\\varepsilon^{-2})$-sparse nuclear sparsifiers. We show that this bound is optimal in both its sparsity and query complexity, and we separate our results from the related notion of additive spectral sparsification. Of independent interest, we show that our sparsification method also yields the first \\emph{deterministic} algorithm for spectral density estimation that scales linearly with $n$ (sublinear in the representation size of the graph).},\n  note =         {Full version available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07521}\n}",

Previous convex relaxation approaches achieving exact recovery do not allow any small clusters of size $o(\\sqrt{n})$, or require a size gap between the smallest recovered cluster and the largest non-recovered cluster. We provide an algorithm based on semidefinite programming (SDP) which removes these requirements and provably recovers large clusters regardless of the remaining cluster sizes. Mid-sized clusters pose unique challenges to the analysis, since their proximity to the recovery threshold makes them highly sensitive to small noise perturbations and precludes a closed-form candidate solution. We develop novel techniques, including a leave-one-out-style argument which controls the correlation between SDP solutions and noise vectors even when the removal of one row of noise can drastically change the SDP solution. We also develop improved eigenvalue perturbation bounds of potential independent interest. Our results are robust to certain semirandom settings that are challenging for alternative algorithms. Using our gap-free clustering procedure, we obtain efficient algorithms for the problem of clustering with a faulty oracle with superior query complexities, notably achieving $o(n^2)$ sample complexity even in the presence of a large number of small clusters.

Due to a large conjectured computational-statistical tradeoff in the problem of sparse linear regression, it may be impossible to close this gap in general. In this work, we propose a natural sparse linear regression setting where strong correlations between covariates arise from unobserved latent variables.

For instance, given a classifier determining loan approval based on credit scores, applicants may open or close their credit cards and bank accounts to fool the classifier. The learning goal is to find a classifier robust against strategic manipulations. Various settings, based on what and when information is known, have been explored in strategic classification. In this work, we focus on addressing a fundamental question: the learnability gaps between strategic classification and standard learning.  We essentially show that any learnable class is also strategically learnable: we first consider a fully informative setting, where the manipulation structure (which is modeled by a manipulation graph $G^\\star$) is known and during training time the learner has access to both the pre-manipulation data and post-manipulation data. We provide nearly tight sample complexity and regret bounds, offering significant improvements over prior results. Then, we relax the fully informative setting by introducing two natural types of uncertainty.  First, following Ahmadi et al.

(2023) and close the gap between mistake upper bound and lower bound raised by them.  Our second relaxation of the fully informative setting introduces uncertainty to the manipulation structure. That is, we assume that the manipulation graph is unknown but belongs to a known class of graphs.

        "abstract": "We study optimization problems in a metric space $(\\mathcal{X},d)$ where we can compute distances in two ways: via a \u201cstrong\u201d oracle that returns exact distances $d(x,y)$, and a \u201cweak\u201d oracle that returns distances $\\tilde{d}(x,y)$ which may be arbitrarily corrupted with some probability. This model captures the increasingly common trade-off between employing both an expensive similarity model (e.g. a large-scale embedding model), and a less accurate but cheaper model. Hence, the goal is to make as few queries to the strong oracle as possible. We consider both \u201cpoint queries\u201d, where the strong oracle is queried on a set of points $S \\subset \\cX $ and returns $d(x,y)$ for all $x,y \\in S$, and \u201cedge queries\u201d where it is queried for individual distances $d(x,y)$.  Our main contributions are optimal algorithms and lower bounds for clustering and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in this model. For $k$-centers, $k$-median, and $k$-means, we give constant factor approximation algorithms with only $\\tilde{O}(k)$ strong oracle point queries, and prove that $\\Omega(k)$ queries are required for any bounded approximation. For edge queries, our upper and lower bounds are both $\\tilde{\\Theta}(k^2)$.

This model captures the increasingly common trade-off between employing both an expensive similarity model (e.g. a large-scale embedding model), and a less accurate but cheaper model. Hence, the goal is to make as few queries to the strong oracle as possible. We consider both \u201cpoint queries\u201d, where the strong oracle is queried on a set of points $S \\subset \\cX $ and returns $d(x,y)$ for all $x,y \\in S$, and \u201cedge queries\u201d where it is queried for individual distances $d(x,y)$.  Our main contributions are optimal algorithms and lower bounds for clustering and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in this model. For $k$-centers, $k$-median, and $k$-means, we give constant factor approximation algorithms with only $\\tilde{O}(k)$ strong oracle point queries, and prove that $\\Omega(k)$ queries are required for any bounded approximation. For edge queries, our upper and lower bounds are both $\\tilde{\\Theta}(k^2)$.

The basic idea is to find a base distribution $Q$ where these inequalities barely hold in many places. We then find two different ensembles of distributions that modify $Q$ in slightly different ways. We use a moment matching construction so that each ensemble has the same bin moments (in particular the expectation over the choice of distribution $p$ of $p_{i}^t$ is the same for the two ensembles for small integers $t$). We show that this makes it impossible to distinguish between the two ensembles with a small number of samples. On the other hand, we construct them so that one ensemble will tweak Q in such a way that it may violate the defining inequalities of the property in question in many places, while the second ensembles does not. Since any valid tester for this property must be able to reliably distinguish these ensembles, we obtain a lower bound of testing the property. Roughly speaking, if we can construct Q which nearly violates the defining inequalities in n places and if the desired error $\\epilon$ is small enough relative to n, we hope to obtain a lower bound of roughly $\\frac{n}{\\epsilon^2}$ up to log factors.

        "abstract": "Recently, Kirkpatrick et al.\u00a0[ALT 2019] and  Fallat et al.\u00a0[JMLR 2023] introduced non-clashing teaching and showed it to be the most efficient machine teaching model satisfying the benchmark for collusion-avoidance set by Goldman and Mathias. A teaching map $T$ for a concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ assigns a (teaching) set $T(C)$ of examples to each concept $C \\in \\mathcal{C}$. A teaching map is non-clashing if no pair of concepts are consistent with the union of their teaching sets. The size of a non-clashing teaching map (NCTM) $T$ is the maximum size of a teaching set $T(C)$, $C \\in \\mathcal{C}$. The non-clashing teaching dimension $\\text{NCTD}(\\mathcal{C})$ of $\\mathcal{C}$ is the minimum size of an NCTM for $\\mathcal{C}$. $\\text{NCTM}^+$ and $\\text{NCTD}^+(\\mathcal{C})$ are defined analogously, except the teacher may only use positive examples.\nWe study NCTMs and $\\text{NCTM}^+\\text{s}$ for the concept class $\\mathcal{B}(G)$ consisting of all balls of a graph $G$. We show that the associated decision problem $\\text{B-NCTD}^+$ for $\\text{NCTD}^+$ is NP-complete in split, co-bipartite, and bipartite graphs. Surprisingly, we even prove that, unless the ETH fails, $\\text{B-NCTD}^+$ does not admit an algorithm running in time $2^{2^{o(\\mathtt{vc})}}\\cdot n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$, nor a kernelization algorithm outputting a kernel with $2^{o(\\mathtt{vc})}$ vertices, where $\\mathtt{vc}$ is the vertex cover number of $G$. We complement these lower bounds with matching upper bounds.

A teaching map $T$ for a concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ assigns a (teaching) set $T(C)$ of examples to each concept $C \\in \\mathcal{C}$. A teaching map is non-clashing if no pair of concepts are consistent with the union of their teaching sets. The size of a non-clashing teaching map (NCTM) $T$ is the maximum size of a teaching set $T(C)$, $C \\in \\mathcal{C}$. The non-clashing teaching dimension $\\text{NCTD}(\\mathcal{C})$ of $\\mathcal{C}$ is the minimum size of an NCTM for $\\mathcal{C}$. $\\text{NCTM}^+$ and $\\text{NCTD}^+(\\mathcal{C})$ are defined analogously, except the teacher may only use positive examples.\nWe study NCTMs and $\\text{NCTM}^+\\text{s}$ for the concept class $\\mathcal{B}(G)$ consisting of all balls of a graph $G$.

An \\textit{omnipredictor} for a class $\\mathcal L$ of loss functions and a class $\\mathcal C$ of hypotheses is a predictor whose predictions incur less expected loss than the best hypothesis in $\\mathcal C$ for every loss in $\\mathcal L$. Since the work of Gopalan et al.

The naive generalization of the previous approaches to regression is to predict the probability distribution of $y$, discretized to $\\varepsilon$-width intervals. The running time would be exponential in the size of the output of the omnipredictor, which is $1/\\varepsilon$. Our main conceptual contribution is the notion of \\textit{sufficient statistics} for loss minimization over a family of loss functions: these are a set of statistics about a distribution such that knowing them allows one to take actions that minimize the expected loss for any loss in the family. The notion of sufficient statistics relates directly to the approximate rank of the family of loss functions. Thus, improved bounds on the latter yield improved runtimes for learning omnipredictors. Our key technical contribution is a bound of $O(1/\\varepsilon^{2/3})$ on the $\\epsilon$-approximate rank of convex, Lipschitz functions on the interval $[0,1]$, which we show is tight up to a factor of $\\mathrm{polylog} (1/\\epsilon)$.

We also give efficient omnipredictors when the loss families have low-degree polynomial approximations, or arise from generalized linear models (GLMs).

We study the problem of efficiently  sampling from the aforementioned distribution using the well-known Markov chain called {\\em Glauber dynamics}. For a certain range of $\\beta$, that depends only on the expected degree $d$ of the graph, and for typical instances of the {2-spin model} on $G(n,d/n)$, we show that the corresponding (single-site) Glauber dynamics exhibits mixing time $O\\left(n^{2+\\frac{3}{\\log^2 d}}\\right)$.  The range of   $\\beta$  for which we obtain our rapid mixing result corresponds to the expected influence being smaller than $1/d$.

However, there exist substantial gaps between the state-of-the-art upper and lower bounds on the optimal sample complexity. Focusing on a hypothesis class of Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension $d$,  we propose a novel algorithm that yields an $\\varepsilon$-optimal randomized hypothesis with a sample complexity on the order of $\\frac{d+k}{\\varepsilon^2}$ (modulo some logarithmic factor), matching the best-known lower bound. Our algorithmic ideas and theory have been further extended to accommodate Rademacher classes. The proposed algorithms are oracle-efficient, which access the hypothesis class solely through an empirical risk minimization oracle. Additionally, we establish the necessity of randomization, unveiling a large sample size barrier when only deterministic hypotheses are permitted. These findings successfully resolve three open problems presented in COLT 2023 (i.e., Problems 1, 3 and 4 of Awasthi et al. 2023).",

Focusing on a hypothesis class of Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension $d$,  we propose a novel algorithm that yields an $\\varepsilon$-optimal randomized hypothesis with a sample complexity on the order of $\\frac{d+k}{\\varepsilon^2}$ (modulo some logarithmic factor), matching the best-known lower bound. Our algorithmic ideas and theory have been further extended to accommodate Rademacher classes. The proposed algorithms are oracle-efficient, which access the hypothesis class solely through an empirical risk minimization oracle. Additionally, we establish the necessity of randomization, unveiling a large sample size barrier when only deterministic hypotheses are permitted. These findings successfully resolve three open problems presented in COLT 2023 (i.e., Problems 1, 3 and 4 of Awasthi et al. 2023).    }\n}",

        "abstract": "Bandit convex optimization (BCO) is a general framework for online decision making under uncertainty.  While tight regret bounds for general convex losses have been established,  existing algorithms achieving these bounds have prohibitive computational costs for high dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a simple and practical BCO algorithm inspired by the online Newton step algorithm. We show that our algorithm achieves optimal (in terms of horizon) regret bounds for a large class of convex functions that satisfy a condition we call $\\kappa$-convexity. This class contains a wide range of practically relevant loss functions including linear losses, quadratic losses, and generalized linear models. In addition to optimal regret,  this method is the most efficient known algorithm for several well-studied applications including bandit logistic regression. Furthermore, we investigate the adaptation of our second-order bandit algorithm to online convex optimization with memory.

While tight regret bounds for general convex losses have been established,  existing algorithms achieving these bounds have prohibitive computational costs for high dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a simple and practical BCO algorithm inspired by the online Newton step algorithm. We show that our algorithm achieves optimal (in terms of horizon) regret bounds for a large class of convex functions that satisfy a condition we call $\\kappa$-convexity. This class contains a wide range of practically relevant loss functions including linear losses, quadratic losses, and generalized linear models. In addition to optimal regret,  this method is the most efficient known algorithm for several well-studied applications including bandit logistic regression. Furthermore, we investigate the adaptation of our second-order bandit algorithm to online convex optimization with memory. We show that for loss functions with a certain affine structure, the extended algorithm attains optimal regret.

Under unconfoundedness, given accurate propensity scores and $n$ samples, the size of confidence intervals of IPW estimators scales down with $n$, and, several of their variants improve the rate of scaling. However, neither IPW estimators nor their variants are robust to inaccuracies: even if a single covariate has an $\\epsilon>0$ additive error in the propensity score, the size of confidence intervals of these estimators can increase arbitrarily. Moreover, even without errors, the rate with which the confidence intervals of these estimators go to zero with $n$ can be arbitrarily slow in the presence of extreme propensity scores (those close to 0 or 1). We introduce a family of Coarse IPW (CIPW) estimators that captures existing IPW estimators and their variants.

Still, there are many problems in differential privacy for which we don\u2019t know suitable lower bounds, and even for problems that we do, the lower bounds are not smooth, and usually become vacuous when the error is larger than some threshold. In this work, we present a new framework and tools to generate smooth lower bounds on the sample complexity of differentially private algorithms satisfying very weak accuracy. We illustrate the applicability of our method by providing new lower bounds in various settings: 1. A tight lower bound for DP averaging in the low-accuracy regime, which in particular implies a lower bound for the private 1-cluster problem introduced by Nissim, Stemmer, and Vadhan (PODS 2016). 2. A lower bound on the additive error of DP algorithms for approximate k-means clustering and general (k,z)-clustering, as a function of the multiplicative error, which is tight for a constant multiplication error. 3. A lower bound for estimating the top singular vector of a matrix under DP in low-accuracy regimes, which is a special case of DP subspace estimation studied by Singhal and Steinke (NeurIPS 2021). Our main technique is to apply a padding-and-permuting transformation to a fingerprinting code. However, rather than proving our results using a black-box access to an existing fingerprinting code (e.g., Tardos\u2019 code), we develop a new fingerprinting lemma that is stronger than those of Dwork et al.

        "abstract": "We consider a statistical version of curriculum learning (CL) in a parametric prediction setting. The learner is required to estimate a target parameter vector, and can adaptively collect samples from either the target model, or other source models that are similar to the target model, but less noisy. We consider three types of learners, depending on the level of side-information they receive. The first two, referred to as strong/weak-oracle learners, receive high/low degrees of information about the models, and use these to learn. The third, a fully adaptive learner, estimates the target parameter vector without any prior information. In the single source case, we propose an elimination learning method, whose risk matches that of a strong-oracle learner. In the multiple source case, we advocate that the risk of the weak-oracle learner is a realistic benchmark for the risk of adaptive learners. We develop an adaptive multiple elimination-rounds CL algorithm, and characterize instance-dependent conditions for its risk to match that of the weak-oracle learner.

The learner is required to estimate a target parameter vector, and can adaptively collect samples from either the target model, or other source models that are similar to the target model, but less noisy. We consider three types of learners, depending on the level of side-information they receive. The first two, referred to as strong/weak-oracle learners, receive high/low degrees of information about the models, and use these to learn. The third, a fully adaptive learner, estimates the target parameter vector without any prior information. In the single source case, we propose an elimination learning method, whose risk matches that of a strong-oracle learner. In the multiple source case, we advocate that the risk of the weak-oracle learner is a realistic benchmark for the risk of adaptive learners. We develop an adaptive multiple elimination-rounds CL algorithm, and characterize instance-dependent conditions for its risk to match that of the weak-oracle learner.

This problem has only been studied when $\\alpha = \\beta$ (prior-free) or $\\alpha = 1/2$ (Bayesian), and the sample complexity is known to be characterized by the Hellinger divergence between $p$ and $q$, up to multiplicative constants. In this paper, we derive a formula that characterizes the sample complexity (up to multiplicative constants that are independent of $p$, $q$, and all error parameters) for: (i) all $0 \\le \\alpha, \\beta \\le 1/8$ in the prior-free setting; and (ii) all $\\delta \\le \\alpha/4$ in the Bayesian setting. In particular, the formula admits equivalent expressions in terms of certain divergences from the Jensen\u2013Shannon and Hellinger families.

One theme of the work is understanding how these dimensions may be re-expressed as natural dimensions of the convexity space of version spaces. Specifically, we find that the star number is precisely the VC dimension of version spaces (and of their disagreement regions), whereas the eluder dimension is precisely the threshold dimension of version spaces (and of their disagreement regions). We are also interested in understanding direct relations among these dimensions. For instance, we show that there is no infinite concept class with both finite Littlestone dimension and finite star number. Moreover, any infinite concept class must have infinite eluder dimension. In both cases, we also provide quantitative relations to the cardinality of the class. For the latter result, we also show an analogous relation for real-valued functions, where the cardinality of the class is replaced by the $L_\\infty$ covering number. As another relation between star numbers and VC dimension, we provide a simple, precise, and general characterization of the VC dimension of the minimal intersection-closed class containing a given concept class: namely, the 1-centered star number of the original class. Moreover, we generalize this result to provide a unifying approach to the design of certain sample compression schemes, along with a simple combinatorial dimension characterizing its compression size: the minimum star number. We also discuss a number of implications of many of these observations. Though the proofs of the above observations are actually all incredibly simple, it is interesting that such fundamental relations among these well-known quantities appear to have heretofore gone unnoticed in the literature.",

Prior works have suggested methods of embedding watermarks in model outputs, by *noticeably* altering the output distribution. We ask: Is it possible to introduce a watermark without incurring *any detectable* change to the output distribution? To this end, we introduce a cryptographically-inspired notion of undetectable watermarks for language models.  That is, watermarks can be detected only with the knowledge of a secret key; without the secret key, it is computationally intractable to distinguish watermarked outputs from those of the original model. In particular, it is impossible for a user to observe any degradation in the quality of the text. Crucially, watermarks remain undetectable even when the user is allowed to adaptively query the model with arbitrarily chosen prompts. We construct undetectable watermarks based on the existence of one-way functions, a standard assumption in cryptography.",

The optimal error rate for recovering cluster labels in Gaussian and sub-Gaussian mixture models involves ad hoc signal-to-noise ratios.

In this paper, we first establish a universal lower bound for the error rate in clustering any mixture model, expressed through Chernoff information, a more versatile measure of model information than signal-to-noise ratios. We then demonstrate that iterative algorithms attain this lower bound in mixture models with sub-exponential tails, notably emphasizing location-scale mixtures featuring Laplace-distributed errors.

Unlike the traditional uniform learning setting, we are interested in obtaining learning guarantees that hold for all fixed data-generating distributions, but do not hold uniformly across them. We focus on the realizable setting and we consider two different well-studied loss functions: the cut-off loss at scale $\\gamma > 0$, which asks for predictions that are $\\gamma$-close to the correct one, and the absolute loss, which measures how far away the prediction is from the correct one.  Our results show that the landscape of the achievable rates in the two cases is completely different. First we give a trichotomic characterization of the optimal learning rates under the cut-off loss: each class is learnable either at an exponential rate, a (nearly) linear rate or requires arbitrarily slow rates. Moving to the absolute loss, we show that the achievable learning rates are significantly more involved by illustrating that an infinite number of different optimal learning rates is achievable.
