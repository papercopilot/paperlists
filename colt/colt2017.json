        "abstract": "Statistical query (SQ) algorithms  are algorithms that have access to an \\em SQ oracle for the input distribution $D$ instead of i.i.d.\u00a0samples from $D$. Given a query function $\u03c6:X \\to [-1,1]$, the oracle returns an estimate of $\\bf E_x\u223cD[\u03c6(x)]$ within some tolerance $\\tau_\u03c6$ that roughly corresponds to the number of samples. In this work we demonstrate that the complexity of solving an arbitrary statistical problem using SQ algorithms can be captured by a relatively simple notion of statistical dimension that we introduce. SQ algorithms capture a broad spectrum of algorithmic approaches used in theory and practice, most notably, convex optimization techniques. Hence our statistical dimension allows to investigate the power of a variety of algorithmic approaches by analyzing a single linear-algebraic parameter.  Such characterizations were investigated over the past 20 years in learning theory but prior characterizations are restricted to the much simpler setting of classification problems relative to a fixed distribution on the domain.  Our characterization is also the first to precisely characterize the necessary tolerance of queries.  We give applications of our techniques to two open problems in learning theory and to algorithms that are subject to memory and communication constraints.",

Our proposed model recovers SAGA, SDCA, Finito, and SAG as special cases. Then we combine jump system theory with several simple quadratic inequalities to derive sufficient conditions for convergence rate certifications of the proposed jump system model under various assumptions (with or without individual convexity, etc). The derived conditions are linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) whose size roughly scale with the size of the training set. We make use of the symmetry in the stochastic optimization methods and reduce these LMIs to some equivalent small LMIs whose sizes are at most 3 by 3. We solve these small LMIs to provide analytical proofs of new convergence rates for SAGA, Finito and SDCA (with or without individual convexity). We also explain why our proposed LMI fails in analyzing SAG. We reveal a key difference between SAG and other methods, and briefly discuss how to extend our LMI analysis for SAG.

We give a simple proof that shows that poly-size depth two neural networks with (exponentially) bounded weights cannot approximate $f$ whenever $g$ cannot be approximated by a low degree polynomial. Moreover, for many $g$\u2019s, such as $g(x)=\\sin(\\pi d^3x)$, the number of neurons must be $2^\u03a9\\left(d\\log(d)\\right)$.

The main technical challenge is to show that a small number of randomly chosen monomials are enough to construct a degree-3 polynomial with precisely planted orthogonal global optima over the sphere and that this fact can be certified within the sum-of-squares proof system.}\n}",

In this paper, we show\u2014arguably, surprisingly\u2014that invoking the classical greedy algorithm $O(\\sqrt{k})$-times leads to the (currently) fastest deterministic algorithm, called RepeatedGreedy, for maximizing a general submodular function subject to $k$-independent system constraints.

We then show that by a careful sampling procedure, we can run the greedy algorithm only \\textitonce and obtain the (currently) fastest randomized algorithm, called SampleGreedy, for maximizing a submodular function subject to $k$-extendible system constraints (a subclass of $k$-independent system constrains). SampleGreedy achieves $(k + 3)$-approximation with only $O(nr/k)$ function evaluations.

        "abstract": "In many learning settings, active/adaptive querying is possible, but the number of rounds of adaptivity is limited. We study the relationship between query complexity and adaptivity in identifying the $k$ most biased coins among a set of $n$ coins with unknown biases. This problem is a common abstraction of many well-studied problems, including the problem of identifying the $k$ best arms in a stochastic multi-armed bandit, and the problem of top-$k$ ranking from pairwise comparisons. An $r$-round adaptive algorithm for the $k$ most biased coins problem specifies in each round the set of coin tosses to be performed based on the observed outcomes in earlier rounds, and outputs the set of $k$ most biased coins at the end of $r$ rounds. When $r=1$, the algorithm is known as \\em non-adaptive; when $r$ is unbounded, the algorithm is known as \\em fully adaptive. While the power of adaptivity in reducing query complexity is well known, full adaptivity requires repeated interaction with the coin tossing (feedback generation) mechanism, and is highly sequential, since the set of coins to be tossed in each round can only be determined after we have observed the outcomes of the coin tosses from the previous round. In contrast, algorithms with only few rounds of adaptivity require fewer rounds of interaction with the feedback generation mechanism, and offer the benefits of parallelism in algorithmic decision-making. Motivated by these considerations, we consider the question of how much adaptivity is needed to realize the optimal worst case query complexity for identifying the $k$ most biased coins. Given any positive integer $r$, we derive essentially matching upper and lower bounds on the query complexity of $r$-round algorithms. We then show that $\u0398(\\log^*n)$ rounds are both necessary and sufficient for achieving the optimal worst case query complexity for identifying the $k$ most biased coins. In particular, our algorithm achieves the optimal query complexity in at most $\\log^*n$ rounds, which implies that on any realistic input, $5$ parallel rounds of exploration suffice to achieve the optimal worst-case sample complexity. The best known algorithm prior to our work required $\u0398(\\log n)$ rounds to achieve the optimal worst case query complexity even for the special case of $k=1$.",

        "abstract": "We study loss functions that measure the accuracy of a prediction based on multiple data points simultaneously. To our knowledge, such loss functions have not been studied before in the area of property elicitation or in machine learning more broadly.

In an \\textscBest-Set instance, we are given $n$ stochastic arms with unknown reward distributions, as well as a family $\\mathcal{F}$ of feasible subsets over the arms. Let the weight of an arm be the mean of its reward distribution. Our goal is to identify the feasible subset in $\\mathcal{F}$ with the maximum total weight, using as few samples as possible. The problem generalizes the classical best arm identification problem and the top-$k$ arm identification problem, both of which have attracted significant attention in recent years. We provide a novel \\textitinstance-wise lower bound for the sample complexity of the problem, as well as a nontrivial sampling algorithm, matching the lower bound up to a factor of $\\ln|\\mathcal{F}|$. For an important class of combinatorial families (including spanning trees, matchings, and path constraints), we also provide polynomial time implementation of the sampling algorithm, using the equivalence of separation and optimization for convex program, and the notion of approximate Pareto curves in multi-objective optimization (note that $|\\mathcal{F}|$ can be exponential in $n$). We also show that the $\\ln|\\mathcal{F}|$ factor is inevitable in general, through a nontrivial lower bound construction utilizing a combinatorial structure resembling the Nisan-Wigderson design. Our results significantly improve several previous results for several important combinatorial constraints, and provide a tighter understanding of the general \\textscBest-Set problem.

(STOC 2014, COLT 2016), we study the connection between computationally efficient PAC learning and refutation of constraint satisfaction problems.  Specifically, we prove that for every concept class $\\mathcal{P}$, PAC-learning $\\mathcal{P}$ is \\em polynomially equivalent to \u201crandom-right-hand-side-refuting\u201d (\u201cRRHS-refuting\u201d) a dual class $\\mathcal{P}^*$, where RRHS-refutation of a class $\\mathcal{Q}$ refers to refuting systems of equations where the constraints are (worst-case) functions from the class $\\mathcal{Q}$ but the right-hand-sides of the equations are uniform and independent random bits. The reduction from refutation to PAC learning can be viewed as an abstraction of (part of) the work of Daniely, Linial, and Shalev-Schwartz (STOC 2014). The converse, however, is new, and is based on a combination of techniques from pseudorandomness (Yao \u201882) with boosting (Schapire \u201890).  In addition, we show that PAC-learning the class of $\\mathit{DNF}$ formulas is polynomially equivalent to PAC-learning its dual class $\\mathit{DNF}^*$, and thus PAC-learning $\\mathit{DNF}$ is equivalent to RRHS-refutation of $\\mathit{DNF}$, suggesting an avenue to obtain stronger lower bounds for PAC-learning $\\mathit{DNF}$ than the quasipolynomial lower bound that was obtained by Daniely and Shalev-Schwartz (COLT 2016) assuming the hardness of refuting $k$-SAT.",

        "abstract": "Learning a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is a fundamental statistical problem. One common notion of learning a GMM is proper learning: here, the goal is to find a mixture of $k$ Gaussians $\\mathcal{M}$ that is close to the unknown density $f$ from which we draw samples. The distance between $\\mathcal{M}$ and $f$ is often measured in the total variation / $L_1$-distance. Our main result is an algorithm for learning a mixture of $k$ univariate Gaussians that is \\emphnearly-optimal for any fixed $k$.  It is well known that the sample complexity of properly learning a univariate $k$-GMM is $O(k / \u03b5^2)$.  However, the best prior \\emphrunning time for this problem is $\\widetilde{O}(1 / \u03b5^3k-1)$; in particular, the dependence between $1/\u03b5$ and $k$ is exponential.  In this paper, we significantly improve this dependence by replacing the $1/\u03b5$ term with $\\log 1/\u03b5$, while only increasing the exponent moderately.  Specifically, the running time of our algorithm is $(k \u22c5\\log 1/ \u03b5)^O(k^4) + \\widetilde{O}(k / \u03b5^2)$.  For any fixed $k$, the $\\widetilde{O}(k / \u03b5^2)$ term dominates our running time, and thus our algorithm runs in time which is \\emphnearly-linear in the number of samples drawn.  Achieving a running time of $\\text{poly}(k, 1 / \u03b5)$ for proper learning of $k$-GMMs has recently been stated as an open problem by multiple researchers, and we make progress on this question. Our main algorithmic ingredient is a new connection between proper learning of parametric distributions and systems of polynomial inequalities.  We leverage results for piecewise polynomial approximation of GMMs and reduce the learning problem to a much smaller sub-problem.  While tihs sub-problem is still non-convex, its size depends only logarithmically on the final accuracy $\u03b5$.  Hence we can invoke computationally expensive methods for solving the sub-problem. We show that our connection is also useful in the multivariate setting, where we get new results for learning a mixture of two spherical Gaussians.  A variant of our approach is also within reach of modern computer algebra systems.  Experiments for learning a 2-GMM show promising results: our algorithm improves over the popular Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm in the noisy setting.",

Achieving a running time of $\\text{poly}(k, 1 / \u03b5)$ for proper learning of $k$-GMMs has recently been stated as an open problem by multiple researchers, and we make progress on this question. Our main algorithmic ingredient is a new connection between proper learning of parametric distributions and systems of polynomial inequalities.  We leverage results for piecewise polynomial approximation of GMMs and reduce the learning problem to a much smaller sub-problem.  While tihs sub-problem is still non-convex, its size depends only logarithmically on the final accuracy $\u03b5$.  Hence we can invoke computationally expensive methods for solving the sub-problem. We show that our connection is also useful in the multivariate setting, where we get new results for learning a mixture of two spherical Gaussians.  A variant of our approach is also within reach of modern computer algebra systems.  Experiments for learning a 2-GMM show promising results: our algorithm improves over the popular Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm in the noisy setting.}\n}",

Namely, if $P$ and $Q$ are the probability distributions defined by two Bayesian networks on the same DAG, our inequality states that the square Hellinger distance, $H^2(P,Q)$, between $P$ and $Q$ is upper bounded by the sum, $\\sum_v H^2(P_{v} \u222a\\Pi_v, Q_{v} \u222a\\Pi_v)$, of the square Hellinger distances between the marginals of $P$ and $Q$ on every node $v$ and its parents $\\Pi_v$ in the DAG. Importantly, our bound does not involve the conditionals but the marginals of $P$ and $Q$. We derive a similar inequality for more general Markov Random Fields. As an application of our inequality, we show that distinguishing whether two (unknown) Bayesian networks $P$ and $Q$ on the same (but potentially unknown) DAG satisfy $P=Q$ vs $d_\\rm TV(P,Q)>\u03b5$ can be performed from $\\tilde{O}(|\u03a3|^3/4(d+1) \u22c5n/\u03b5^2)$ samples, where $d$ is the maximum in-degree of the DAG and $\u03a3$ the domain of each variable of the Bayesian networks. If $P$ and $Q$ are defined on potentially different and potentially unknown trees, the sample complexity becomes $\\tilde{O}(|\u03a3|^4.5 n/\u03b5^2)$. In both cases the dependence of the sample complexity on $n, \u03b5$ is optimal up to logarithmic factors.

Namely, if $P$ and $Q$ are the probability distributions defined by two Bayesian networks on the same DAG, our inequality states that the square Hellinger distance, $H^2(P,Q)$, between $P$ and $Q$ is upper bounded by the sum, $\\sum_v H^2(P_{v} \u222a\\Pi_v, Q_{v} \u222a\\Pi_v)$, of the square Hellinger distances between the marginals of $P$ and $Q$ on every node $v$ and its parents $\\Pi_v$ in the DAG. Importantly, our bound does not involve the conditionals but the marginals of $P$ and $Q$. We derive a similar inequality for more general Markov Random Fields. As an application of our inequality, we show that distinguishing whether two (unknown) Bayesian networks $P$ and $Q$ on the same (but potentially unknown) DAG satisfy $P=Q$ vs $d_\\rm TV(P,Q)>\u03b5$ can be performed from $\\tilde{O}(|\u03a3|^3/4(d+1) \u22c5n/\u03b5^2)$ samples, where $d$ is the maximum in-degree of the DAG and $\u03a3$ the domain of each variable of the Bayesian networks. If $P$ and $Q$ are defined on potentially different and potentially unknown trees, the sample complexity becomes $\\tilde{O}(|\u03a3|^4.5 n/\u03b5^2)$. In both cases the dependence of the sample complexity on $n, \u03b5$ is optimal up to logarithmic factors. Lastly, if $P$ and $Q$ are product distributions over ${0,1}^n$ and $Q$ is known, the sample complexity becomes $O(\\sqrt{n}/\u03b5^2)$, which is optimal up to constant factors.}\n}",

The special rows with higher variance entries can be viewed as hidden higher-degree hubs. The problem we address is to identify the hubs efficiently. The planted Gaussian Submatrix Model is the special case where the higher variance entries must all lie in a $k \\times k$ submatrix. If $k\u2265c\\sqrt{n}\\ln n$, just the row sums are sufficient to find $S$ in the general model. For the Gaussian submatrix problem (and the related planted clique problem), this can be improved by a $\\sqrt\\ln n$ factor to $k \\ge c\\sqrt{n}$ by spectral or combinatorial methods. We give a polynomial-time algorithm to identify all the hidden hubs with high probability for $k \\ge n^0.5-\u03b4$ for some $\u03b4>0$, when $\\sigma_1^2>2\\sigma_0^2$.  The algorithm extends to the setting where planted entries might have different variances, each at least $\\sigma_1^2$. We also show a nearly matching lower bound: for $\\sigma_1^2 \\le 2\\sigma_0^2$, there is no polynomial-time Statistical Query algorithm for distinguishing between a matrix whose entries are all from $N(0,\\sigma_0^2)$ and a matrix with $k=n^0.5-\u03b4$ hidden hubs for any $\u03b4>0$. The lower bound as well as the algorithm are related to whether the chi-squared distance of the two distributions diverges. At the critical value $\\sigma_1^2=2\\sigma_0^2$, we show that the hidden hubs problem can be solved for $k\u2265c\\sqrt n(\\ln n)^1/4$, improving on the naive row sum-based method.",

That is, given a data matrix $M^*$, where $(1-\u03b1)$ fraction of the points are noisy samples from a low-dimensional subspace while $\u03b1$ fraction of the points can be arbitrary outliers, the goal is to recover the subspace accurately. Existing results for \\textbfOR-PCA\u00a0have serious drawbacks: while some results are quite weak in the presence of noise, other results have runtime quadratic in dimension, rendering them impractical for large scale applications. In this work, we provide a novel thresholding based iterative algorithm with per-iteration complexity at most linear in the data size.

        "abstract": "In the classical best arm identification (Best-$1$-Arm) problem, we are given $n$ stochastic bandit arms, each associated with a reward distribution with an unknown mean. Upon each play of an arm, we can get a reward sampled i.i.d. from its reward distribution. We would like to identify the arm with the largest mean with probability at least $1-\u03b4$, using as few samples as possible. The problem has a long history and understanding its sample complexity has attracted significant attention since the last decade. However, the optimal sample complexity of the problem is still unknown. Recently, Chen and Li (2016) made an interesting conjecture, called gap-entropy conjecture, concerning the instance optimal sample complexity of Best-$1$-Arm. Given a Best-$1$-Arm instance $I$ (i.e., a set of arms), let $\\mu_[i]$ denote the $i$th largest mean and $\\Delta_[i]=\\mu_[1]-\\mu_[i]$ denote the corresponding gap. $H(I)=\\sum_i=2^n\\Delta_[i]^-2$ denotes the complexity of the instance. The gap-entropy conjecture states that for any instance $I$, $\u03a9\\left(H(I)\u22c5\\left(\\ln\u03b4^-1 + \\mathsf{Ent}(I)\\right)\\right)$ is an instance lower bound, where $\\mathsf{Ent}(I)$ is an entropy-like term determined by the gaps, and there is a $\u03b4$-correct algorithm for Best-$1$-Arm with sample complexity $O\\left(H(I)\u22c5\\left(\\ln\u03b4^-1 + \\mathsf{Ent}(I)\\right)+\\Delta_[2]^-2\\ln\\ln\\Delta_[2]^-1\\right)$. We note that $\u0398\\left(\\Delta_[2]^-2\\ln\\ln\\Delta_[2]^-1\\right)$ is necessary and sufficient to solve the two-arm instance with the best and second best arms. If the conjecture is true, we would have a complete understanding of the instance-wise sample complexity of Best-$1$-Arm (up to constant factors). In this paper, we make significant progress towards a complete resolution of the gap-entropy conjecture. For the upper bound, we provide a highly nontrivial algorithm which requires \\[O\\left(H(I)\u22c5\\left(\\ln\u03b4^-1 + \\mathsf{Ent}(I)\\right)+\\Delta_[2]^-2\\ln\\ln\\Delta_[2]^-1\\mathrmpolylog(n,\u03b4^-1)\\right)\\]samples in expectation for any instance $I$.
