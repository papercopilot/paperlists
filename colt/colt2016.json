But unlike convex optimization, geodesically convex (g-convex) optimization is much less developed. In this paper we contribute to the understanding of g-convex optimization by developing iteration complexity analysis for several first-order algorithms on Hadamard manifolds. Specifically, we prove upper bounds for the global complexity of deterministic and stochastic (sub)gradient methods for optimizing smooth and nonsmooth g-convex functions, both with and without strong g-convexity. Our analysis also reveals how the manifold geometry, especially \\emphsectional curvature, impacts convergence rates. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to provide global complexity analysis for first-order algorithms for general g-convex optimization.",

In learning theory, this is known as the problem of \\emphlearning halfspaces with noise, and in signal processing, as \\emph1-bit compressed sensing, in which there is an additional assumption that w^* is t-sparse. The challenge in both cases is to design computationally efficient algorithms that are tolerant to large amounts of noise under realistic noise models. Furthermore, in the case of 1-bit compressed sensing, we require  the number of measurements x_i to scale polynomially in t and only polylogarithmically in d, the ambient dimension. In this work, we introduce algorithms with nearly optimal guarantees for both problems under two realistic noise models, \\emphbounded (Massart) noise and \\emphadversarial (agnostic) noise, when the measurements x_i\u2019s are drawn from any isotropic log-concave distribution.

Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL), as an agent-environment interaction problem, has brought further attention to planning methods. Generally in RL, one can assume a generative model, e.g. graphical models, for the environment, and then the task for the RL agent is to learn the model parameters and find the optimal strategy based on these learnt parameters. Based on environment behavior, the agent can assume various types of generative models, e.g. Multi Armed Bandit for a static environment, or Markov Decision Process (MDP) for a dynamic environment.

More complex models like Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) can compensate for this drawback. Fitting this model to the environment, where the partial observation is given to the agent, generally gives dramatic performance improvement, sometimes unbounded improvement, compared to MDP.

A Poisson binomial distribution (PBD) of order n \u2208\\mathbbZ_+ is the discrete probability distribution of the sum of n mutually independent Bernoulli random variables. Given \\widetildeO(1/\u03b5^2) samples from an unknown PBD P, our algorithm runs in time (1/\\eps)^O(\\log \\log (1/\u03b5)), and outputs a hypothesis PBD that is \u03b5-close to P in total variation distance. The sample complexity of our algorithm is known to be nearly-optimal, up to logarithmic factors, as established in previous work. However, the previously best known running time for properly learning PBDs was (1/\u03b5)^O(\\log(1/\u03b5)), and was essentially obtained by enumeration over an appropriate  \u03b5-cover. We remark that the running time of this cover-based approach cannot be improved, as any \u03b5-cover for the space of PBDs has size  (1/\u03b5)^\u03a9(\\log(1/\u03b5)). As one of our main contributions, we provide a novel structural characterization of PBDs, showing that any PBD P is \u03b5-close to another PBD Q with O(\\log(1/\u03b5)) distinct parameters. More precisely, we prove that, for all \u03b5>0, there exists an explicit collection \\calM of (1/\u03b5)^O(\\log \\log (1/\u03b5)) vectors of multiplicities, such that for any PBD P there exists a PBD Q with O(\\log(1/\u03b5)) distinct parameters whose multiplicities are given by some element of \\cal M, such that Q is \u03b5-close to P.  Our proof combines tools from Fourier analysis and algebraic geometry. Our approach to the proper learning problem is as follows: Starting with an accurate non-proper hypothesis, we fit a PBD to this hypothesis. This fitting problem can be formulated as a natural polynomial optimization problem. Our aforementioned structural characterization allows us to reduce the corresponding fitting problem to a collection of (1/\u03b5)^O(\\log \\log(1/\u03b5)) systems of low-degree polynomial inequalities.

In a Best-Basis instance, we are given n stochastic arms with unknown reward distributions, as well as a matroid \\mathcalM over the arms. Let the weight of an arm be the mean of its reward distribution. Our goal is to identify a basis of \\mathcalM with the maximum total weight, using as few samples as possible. The problem is a significant generalization of the best arm identification problem and the top-k arm identification problem, which have attracted significant attentions in recent years. We study both the exact and PAC versions of Best-Basis, and provide algorithms with nearly-optimal sample complexities for these versions. Our results generalize and/or improve on several previous results for the top-k arm identification problem and the combinatorial pure exploration problem when the combinatorial constraint is a matroid.",

In a frequestist setting where the true quality of the designs is fixed, one hopes the posterior definitively identifies the optimal design, in the sense that that the posterior probability assigned to the event that some other design is optimal converges to zero as measurements are collected. I show that under the proposed algorithms this convergence occurs at an \\emphexponential rate, and the corresponding exponent is the best possible among all allocation rules.}\n}",

We prove new generalization guarantees for hypotheses derived from regret minimization algorithms in the general scenario where the data is generated by a non-stationary non-mixing stochastic process. Our theory enables us to derive model selection techniques with favorable theoretical guarantees in the scenario of time series, thereby solving a problem that is notoriously difficult in that scenario. It also helps us devise new ensemble methods with favorable theoretical guarantees for the task of forecasting non-stationary time series.",

Here we consider a general setting where outcomes of pairwise comparisons between items i and j are drawn probabilistically by flipping a coin with unknown bias P_ij , and ask under what conditions on these unknown probabilities one can learn a good ranking from comparisons of only O(n\\log(n)) non-actively chosen pairs. Recent work has established this is possible under the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) and noisy permutation (NP) models. Here we introduce a broad family of \u2018low-rank\u2019 conditions on the probabilities P_ij under which the resulting preference matrix P has low rank under some link function, and show these conditions encompass the BTL and Thurstone classes as special cases, but are considerably more general. We then give a new algorithm called low-rank pairwise ranking (LRPR) which provably learns a good ranking from comparisons of only O(n\\log(n)) randomly chosen comparisons under such low-rank models. Our algorithm and analysis make use of tools from the theory of low-rank matrix completion, and provide a new perspective on the problem of ranking from pairwise comparisons in non-active settings.",
