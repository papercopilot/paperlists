We derive the first small-loss bound for general strongly observable graphs, resolving an open problem of Lykouris et al. (2018). Specifically, we develop an algorithm with regret $\\mathcal{\\tilde{O}}(\\sqrt{\\kappa L_*})$ where $\\kappa$ is the clique partition number and $L_*$ is the loss of the best arm, and for the special case of self-aware graphs where every arm has a self-loop, we improve the regret to $\\mathcal{\\tilde{O}}(\\min\\{\\sqrt{\\alpha T}, \\sqrt{\\kappa L_*}\\})$ where $\\alpha \\leq \\kappa$ is the independence number. Our results significantly improve and extend those by Lykouris et al. (2018) who only consider self-aware undirected graphs. Furthermore, we also take the first attempt at deriving small-loss bounds for weakly observable graphs. We first prove that no typical small-loss bounds are achievable in this case, and then propose algorithms with alternative small-loss bounds in terms of the loss of some specific subset of arms. A surprising side result is that $\\mathcal{\\tilde{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret is achievable even for weakly observable graphs as long as the best arm has a self-loop. Our algorithms are based on the Online Mirror Descent framework but require a suite of novel techniques that might be of independent interest. Moreover, all our algorithms can be made parameter-free without the knowledge of the environment.",

This technique yields several new representation and learning results for neural networks: 1.  Two-layer neural networks in the random features regime (RF) can memorize arbitrary labels for $n$ arbitrary points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with $\\tilde{O}(\\tfrac{n}{\\theta^4})$ ReLUs, where $\\theta$ is the minimum distance between two different points. This bound can be shown to be optimal in $n$ up to logarithmic factors. 2.  Two-layer neural networks with ReLUs and smoothed ReLUs can represent functions with an error of at most $\\epsilon$ with $O(C(a,d)\\epsilon^{-1/(a+1)})$ units for $a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\cup\\{0\\}$ when the function has $\\Theta(ad)$ bounded derivatives.

Our results indicate that neural networks with only a single nonlinear layer are surprisingly powerful with regards to representation, and show that in contrast to what is suggested in recent work, depth is not needed in order to represent highly smooth functions. 3.

Polynomial-time solutions to this problem are known but have high runtime due to their use of semi-definite programming (SDP).

Given complete control over the system\u2019s input, our algorithm adaptively chooses the inputs to accelerate estimation. We show a finite time bound quantifying the estimation rate our algorithm attains and prove matching upper and lower bounds which guarantee its asymptotic optimality, up to constants. In addition, we show that this optimal rate is unattainable when using Gaussian noise to excite the system, even with optimally tuned covariance, and analyze several examples where our algorithm provably improves over rates obtained by playing noise.

In particular, the number of label queries should be independent of the complexity of $H$, and the function $h$ should be well-defined, independent of $x$.  This immediately also implies an algorithm for {\\em distance estimation}: estimating the value $opt(H)$ from many fewer labels than needed to actually learn a near-optimal $h \\in H$, by running local learning on a few random query points and computing the average error.

Next, we study maximization of an adaptive submodular function, which is submodular in a probabilistic sense, subject to a stochastic knapsack constraint, which requires the total item cost to be within a given capacity with probability one. We present the MIX policy for this problem; our approximation guarantee for it is the first known approximation guarantee for maximizing a non-linear utility function subject to a stochastic knapsack constraint. Using alternative parameterizations of MIX, we also derive the first known approximation guarantees for maximizing an adaptive submodular function subject to a deterministic knapsack constraint. Our guarantees are powered by an innovative differential analysis technique which models the $\\beta$-GREEDY policy using a continuous-time stochastic reward process of a particle whose reward is related to the optimal utility through a differential inequality.

These properties include well-known distribution characteristics such as Shannon entropy and support size  ($d=1$), and many important divergence measures between distributions ($d=2$). The primary problem being considered is to learn the property value of an $\\emph{unknown}$ $d$-tuple of distributions from its sample.

In this work, we provide a complete understanding of the interplay between the amount of shared randomness available, the stringency of information constraints, and the sample complexity of the testing problem by characterizing a tight trade-off between these three parameters. We provide a general distributed goodness-of-fit protocol that as a function of the amount of shared randomness interpolates smoothly between the private- and public-coin sample complexities. We complement our upper bound with a general framework to prove lower bounds on the sample complexity of this testing problems under limited shared randomness. Finally, we instantiate our bounds for the two archetypal information constraints of communication and local privacy, and show that our sample complexity bounds are optimal as a function of all the parameters of the problem, including the amount of shared randomness.

We show that if the truncation set is sufficiently fat, samples from the true distribution can be generated from truncated samples. A stunning consequence is that virtually any statistical task (e.g., learning in total variation distance, parameter estimation, uniformity or identity testing) that can be performed efficiently for Boolean product distributions, can also be performed from truncated samples, with a small increase in sample complexity. We generalize our approach to ranking distributions over $d$ alternatives, where we show how fatness implies efficient parameter estimation of Mallows models from truncated samples. Exploring the limits of learning discrete models from truncated samples, we identify three natural conditions that are necessary for efficient identifiability: (i) the truncation set $S$ should be rich enough; (ii) $S$ should be accessible through membership queries; and (iii) the truncation by $S$ should leave enough randomness in all directions.

Despite their widespread use, their theoretical underpinnings are far from being fully understood. Recent breakthrough advances have shown that such greedily built trees are asymptotically consistent [Biau et al. 2010, Denil et al. 2014, Scornet et al. 2015] in the low dimensional regime, where the number of features is a constant, independent of the sample size. Also, the works of [Mentch et al. 2016, Wager et al. 2018] provide asymptotic normality results for honest versions of Random Forests. In this work, we analyze the performance of regression trees and forests with binary features in the high-dimensional regime, where the number of features can grow exponentially with the number of samples.  We show that trees and forests built greedily based on the celebrated CART criterion, provably adapt to sparsity: when only a subset $R$, of size $r$, of the features are relevant, then the mean squared error of appropriately shallow trees, or  fully grown honest forests, scales exponentially only with the number of relevant features and depends only logarithmically on the overall number of features. More precisely, we identify three regimes, each providing different dependence on the number of relevant features. When the relevant variables are \u201cweakly\u201d relevant (in the sense that there is not strong separation between the relevant and irrelevant variables in terms of their ability to reduce variance), then shallow trees achieve \u201cslow rates\u201d on the mean squared error of the order of $2^r/\\sqrt{n}$, when variables are independent, and $1/n^{1/(r+2)}$, when variables are dependent. When the relevant variables are \u201cstrongly\u201d relevant, in that there is a separation in their ability to reduce variance as compared to the irrelevant ones, by a constant $\\beta_{\\min}$, then we show that greedily built shallow trees and fully grown honest forests can achieve fast parametric mean squared error rates of the order of $2^r/(\\beta_{\\min}\\,{n})$. When variables are strongly relevant, we also show that the predictions of sub-sampled honest forests have an asymptotically normal distribution centered around their true values and whose variance scales at most as $O(2^r \\log(n)/(\\beta_{\\min}\\,{n}))$. Thus, sub-sampled honest forests are provably a data-adaptive method for non-parametric inference, that adapts to the latent sparsity dimension of the data generating distribution, as opposed to classical non-parametric regression approaches. Our results show that, at least for the case of binary features, forest based algorithms can offer immense improvement on the statistical power of non-parametric hypothesis tests in high-dimensional regimes.",

Without any structural restrictions, it is impossible to learn the composition of the full population having observed only a small (random) subsample of size $m = o(k)$. Nevertheless, we show that in the sublinear regime of $m =\\omega(k/\\log k)$, it is possible to consistently estimate in total variation the \\emph{profile} of the population, defined as the empirical distribution of the sizes of each type, which determines many symmetric properties of the population. We also prove that in the linear regime of $m=c k$ for any constant $c$ the optimal rate is $\\Theta(1/\\log k)$. Our estimator is based on Wolfowitz\u2019s minimum distance method, which entails solving a linear program (LP) of size $k$.

Nevertheless, we show that in the sublinear regime of $m =\\omega(k/\\log k)$, it is possible to consistently estimate in total variation the \\emph{profile} of the population, defined as the empirical distribution of the sizes of each type, which determines many symmetric properties of the population. We also prove that in the linear regime of $m=c k$ for any constant $c$ the optimal rate is $\\Theta(1/\\log k)$. Our estimator is based on Wolfowitz\u2019s minimum distance method, which entails solving a linear program (LP) of size $k$.

Prior work, based on the low-degree likelihood ratio, has conjectured a precise expression for the best possible (sub-exponential) runtime throughout the hard regime. Following instead a statistical physics inspired point of view, we show bounds on the depth of free energy wells for various Gibbs measures naturally associated to the problem. These free energy wells imply hitting time lower bounds that corroborate the low-degree conjecture: we show that a class of natural MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) methods (with worst-case initialization) cannot solve sparse PCA with less than the conjectured runtime.

Prior work, based on the low-degree likelihood ratio, has conjectured a precise expression for the best possible (sub-exponential) runtime throughout the hard regime. Following instead a statistical physics inspired point of view, we show bounds on the depth of free energy wells for various Gibbs measures naturally associated to the problem. These free energy wells imply hitting time lower bounds that corroborate the low-degree conjecture: we show that a class of natural MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) methods (with worst-case initialization) cannot solve sparse PCA with less than the conjectured runtime. These lower bounds apply to a wide range of values for two tuning parameters: temperature and sparsity misparametrization.

        "abstract": "We study identity testing for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), and more generally for undirected graphical models. Given sample access to the Gibbs distribution corresponding to an unknown or hidden model $M^*$  and given an explicit model $M$, can we distinguish if either $M = M^*$ or if they are (statistically) far apart? Daskalakis et al.\u00a0(2018) presented a polynomial-time algorithm for identity testing for the ferromagnetic (attractive) Ising model. In contrast, for the antiferromagnetic (repulsive) Ising model, Bez\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al.\u00a0(2019) proved that unless $RP=NP$ there is no identity testing algorithm when $\\beta d=\\omega(\\log{n})$, where $d$ is the maximum degree of the visible graph and $\\beta$ is the largest edge weight (in absolute value). We prove analogous hardness results for RBMs (i.e., mixed Ising models on bipartite graphs), even when there are no latent variables or an external field. Specifically, we show that if $RP\\neq NP$, then when $\\beta d=\\omega(\\log{n})$ there is no polynomial-time algorithm for identity testing for RBMs; when $\\beta d =O(\\log{n})$ there is an efficient identity testing algorithm that utilizes the structure learning algorithm of Klivans and Meka (2017). In addition, we prove similar lower bounds for purely ferromagnetic RBMs with inconsistent external fields, and for the ferromagnetic Potts model. Previous hardness results for identity testing of Bez\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al. (2019) utilized the hardness of finding the maximum cuts, which corresponds to the ground states of the antiferromagnetic Ising model. Since RBMs are on bipartite graphs such an approach is not feasible.

Given sample access to the Gibbs distribution corresponding to an unknown or hidden model $M^*$  and given an explicit model $M$, can we distinguish if either $M = M^*$ or if they are (statistically) far apart? Daskalakis et al.\u00a0(2018) presented a polynomial-time algorithm for identity testing for the ferromagnetic (attractive) Ising model. In contrast, for the antiferromagnetic (repulsive) Ising model, Bez\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al.\u00a0(2019) proved that unless $RP=NP$ there is no identity testing algorithm when $\\beta d=\\omega(\\log{n})$, where $d$ is the maximum degree of the visible graph and $\\beta$ is the largest edge weight (in absolute value). We prove analogous hardness results for RBMs (i.e., mixed Ising models on bipartite graphs), even when there are no latent variables or an external field. Specifically, we show that if $RP\\neq NP$, then when $\\beta d=\\omega(\\log{n})$ there is no polynomial-time algorithm for identity testing for RBMs; when $\\beta d =O(\\log{n})$ there is an efficient identity testing algorithm that utilizes the structure learning algorithm of Klivans and Meka (2017). In addition, we prove similar lower bounds for purely ferromagnetic RBMs with inconsistent external fields, and for the ferromagnetic Potts model. Previous hardness results for identity testing of Bez\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al. (2019) utilized the hardness of finding the maximum cuts, which corresponds to the ground states of the antiferromagnetic Ising model. Since RBMs are on bipartite graphs such an approach is not feasible. We instead introduce a novel methodology to reduce from the corresponding approximate counting problem and utilize the phase transition that is exhibited by RBMs and the mean-field Potts model. We believe that our method is general, and that it can be used to establish the hardness of identity testing for other spin systems.}\n}",

        "abstract": "What is the optimal number of independent observations from which a sparse Gaussian Graphical Model can be correctly recovered? Information-theoretic arguments provide a lower bound on the minimum number of samples necessary to perfectly identify the support of any multivariate normal distribution as a function of model parameters. For a model defined on a sparse graph with $p$ nodes, a maximum degree $d$ and minimum normalized edge strength $\\kappa$, this necessary number of samples scales at least as $d \\log p/\\kappa^2$. The sample complexity requirements of existing methods for perfect graph reconstruction exhibit dependency on additional parameters that do not enter in the lower bound. The question of whether the  lower bound is tight and achievable by a polynomial time algorithm remains open. In this paper, we constructively answer this question and propose an algorithm, termed DICE, whose sample complexity matches the information-theoretic lower bound up to a universal constant factor. We also propose a related algorithm SLICE that has a slightly higher sample complexity, but can be implemented as a mixed integer quadratic program which makes it attractive in practice.

Information-theoretic arguments provide a lower bound on the minimum number of samples necessary to perfectly identify the support of any multivariate normal distribution as a function of model parameters. For a model defined on a sparse graph with $p$ nodes, a maximum degree $d$ and minimum normalized edge strength $\\kappa$, this necessary number of samples scales at least as $d \\log p/\\kappa^2$. The sample complexity requirements of existing methods for perfect graph reconstruction exhibit dependency on additional parameters that do not enter in the lower bound. The question of whether the  lower bound is tight and achievable by a polynomial time algorithm remains open. In this paper, we constructively answer this question and propose an algorithm, termed DICE, whose sample complexity matches the information-theoretic lower bound up to a universal constant factor. We also propose a related algorithm SLICE that has a slightly higher sample complexity, but can be implemented as a mixed integer quadratic program which makes it attractive in practice. Importantly, SLICE retains a critical advantage of DICE in that its sample complexity only depends on quantities present in the information theoretic lower bound. We anticipate that this result will stimulate future search of computationally efficient sample-optimal algorithms.}\n}",

        "abstract": "Polynomial regression is a basic primitive in learning and statistics. In its most basic form the goal is to fit a degree $d$ polynomial  to a response variable $y$ in terms of an $n$-dimensional input vector $x$. This is extremely well-studied with many applications and has sample and runtime complexity $\\Theta(n^d)$. Can one achieve better runtime if the intrinsic dimension of the data is much smaller than the ambient dimension $n$? Concretely, we are given samples $(x,y)$ where $y$ is a degree at most $d$ polynomial in an unknown $r$-dimensional projection (the relevant dimensions) of $x$. This can be seen both as a generalization of phase retrieval and as a special case of learning multi-index models where the link function is an unknown low-degree polynomial. Note that without distributional assumptions, this is at least as hard as junta learning. In this work we consider the important case where the covariates are Gaussian. We give an algorithm that learns the polynomial within accuracy $\\epsilon$ with sample complexity that is roughly $N = O_{r,d}(n \\log^2(1/\\epsilon) (\\log n)^d)$ and runtime $O_{r,d}(N n^2)$. Prior to our work, no such results were known even for the case of $r=1$. We introduce a new \\emph{filtered PCA} approach to get a warm start for the true subspace and use \\emph{geodesic SGD} to boost to arbitrary accuracy; our techniques may be of independent interest, especially for problems dealing with subspace recovery or analyzing SGD on manifolds.",

        "abstract": "We initiate the study of hypothesis selection under local differential privacy. Given samples from an unknown probability distribution $p$ and a set of $k$ probability distributions $\\mathcal{Q}$, we aim to output, under the constraints of $\\varepsilon$-differential privacy, a distribution from $\\mathcal{Q}$ whose total variation distance to $p$ is comparable to the best such distribution. This is a generalization of the classic problem of $k$-wise simple hypothesis testing, which corresponds to when $p \\in \\mathcal{Q}$, and we wish to identify $p$. Absent privacy constraints, this problem requires $O(\\log k)$ samples from $p$, and it was recently shown that the same complexity is achievable under (central) differential privacy. However, the naive approach to this problem under local differential privacy would require $\\tilde O(k^2)$ samples. We first show that the constraint of local differential privacy incurs an exponential increase in cost: any algorithm for this problem requires at least $\\Omega(k)$ samples. Second, for the special case of $k$-wise simple hypothesis testing, we provide a non-interactive algorithm which nearly matches this bound, requiring $\\tilde O(k)$ samples. Finally, we provide sequentially interactive algorithms for the general case, requiring $\\tilde O(k)$ samples and only $O(\\log \\log k)$ rounds of interactivity. Our algorithms are achieved through a reduction to maximum selection with adversarial comparators, a problem of independent interest for which we initiate study in the parallel setting.

Given samples from an unknown probability distribution $p$ and a set of $k$ probability distributions $\\mathcal{Q}$, we aim to output, under the constraints of $\\varepsilon$-differential privacy, a distribution from $\\mathcal{Q}$ whose total variation distance to $p$ is comparable to the best such distribution. This is a generalization of the classic problem of $k$-wise simple hypothesis testing, which corresponds to when $p \\in \\mathcal{Q}$, and we wish to identify $p$. Absent privacy constraints, this problem requires $O(\\log k)$ samples from $p$, and it was recently shown that the same complexity is achievable under (central) differential privacy. However, the naive approach to this problem under local differential privacy would require $\\tilde O(k^2)$ samples. We first show that the constraint of local differential privacy incurs an exponential increase in cost: any algorithm for this problem requires at least $\\Omega(k)$ samples. Second, for the special case of $k$-wise simple hypothesis testing, we provide a non-interactive algorithm which nearly matches this bound, requiring $\\tilde O(k)$ samples. Finally, we provide sequentially interactive algorithms for the general case, requiring $\\tilde O(k)$ samples and only $O(\\log \\log k)$ rounds of interactivity. Our algorithms are achieved through a reduction to maximum selection with adversarial comparators, a problem of independent interest for which we initiate study in the parallel setting. For this problem, we provide a family of algorithms for each number of allowed rounds of interaction $t$, as well as lower bounds showing that they are near-optimal for every $t$.

The goal of the online algorithm is to minimize the $\\ell_p$ norm of the sum of its cost vectors. This captures the classical online learning setting for $d=1$, and is interesting for general $d$ because of applications like online scheduling where we want to balance the load between different machines (dimensions). We study $OLVC_p$ in both stochastic and adversarial arrival settings, and give a general procedure to reduce the  problem from $d$ dimensions to  a single dimension. This allows us to use classical online learning algorithms in both full and bandit feedback models to obtain (near) optimal results. In particular, we obtain a single algorithm   (up to the choice of learning rate) that gives sublinear regret for stochastic arrivals and a tight $O(\\min\\{p, \\log d\\})$ competitive ratio for adversarial arrivals. The $OLVC_p$ problem also occurs as a natural subproblem when trying to solve the popular Bandits with Knapsacks (BWK) problem. This connection allows us to use our $OLVC_p$ techniques to obtain (near) optimal results for BWK in both stochastic and adversarial settings. In particular, we obtain a tight $O(\\log d \\cdot \\log T)$ competitive ratio algorithm for adversarial BWK, which improves over the $O(d \\cdot \\log T)$ competitive ratio algorithm  of Immorlica et al.

However, little is known about even their most basic theoretical convergence properties, including:  if and how fast they converge to a globally optimal solution (say with a sufficiently rich policy class);  how they cope with approximation error due to using a restricted class of parametric policies; or  their finite sample behavior.  Such characterizations are important not only to compare these methods to their approximate value function counterparts (where such issues are relatively well understood, at least in the worst case), but also to help with more principled approaches to algorithm design. This work provides provable characterizations of computational, approximation, and sample size issues with regards to policy gradient methods in the context of discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We focus on both: 1) \u201ctabular\u201d policy parameterizations, where the optimal policy is contained in the class and where we show global convergence to the optimal policy, and 2) restricted policy classes, which may not contain the optimal policy and where we provide agnostic learning results.  In the \\emph{tabular setting}, our main results are: 1) convergence rate to global optimum for direct parameterization and projected gradient ascent  2) an asymptotic convergence to global optimum for softmax policy parameterization and PG; and a convergence rate with additional entropy regularization, and 3) dimension-free convergence to global optimum for softmax policy parameterization and Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) method with exact gradients. In \\emph{function approximation}, we further analyze NPG with exact as well as inexact gradients under certain smoothness assumptions on the policy parameterization and establish rates of convergence in terms of the quality of the initial state distribution. One insight of this work is in formalizing how a favorable initial state distribution provides a means to circumvent worst-case exploration issues.

Under the assumptions of realizable function approximation and low Bellman ranks, we develop an online learning algorithm that learns the optimal value function while at the same time achieving very low cumulative regret during the learning process. Our learning algorithm, Adaptive Value-function Elimination (AVE), is inspired by the policy elimination algorithm proposed in (Jiang et al., 2017), known as OLIVE. One of our key technical contributions in AVE is to formulate the elimination steps in OLIVE as contextual bandit problems.

Under the assumptions of realizable function approximation and low Bellman ranks, we develop an online learning algorithm that learns the optimal value function while at the same time achieving very low cumulative regret during the learning process. Our learning algorithm, Adaptive Value-function Elimination (AVE), is inspired by the policy elimination algorithm proposed in (Jiang et al., 2017), known as OLIVE. One of our key technical contributions in AVE is to formulate the elimination steps in OLIVE as contextual bandit problems. This technique enables us to apply the active elimination and expert weighting methods from (Dudik et al., 2011), instead of the random action exploration scheme used in the original OLIVE algorithm, for more efficient exploration and better control of the regret incurred in each policy elimination step.

We show several surprising results, such as 1) the optimal regret is $\\mathcal{O}(\\min\\{\\sqrt{T}, \\sqrt{\\mathcal{E}}T^\\frac{1}{4}\\})$ when $\\mathcal{E}$ is known, in contrast to the standard and better bound $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\mathcal{E}})$ for non-contextual problems (such as multi-armed bandits); 2) the same bound cannot be achieved if $\\mathcal{E}$ is unknown, but as a remedy, $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\mathcal{E}}T^\\frac{1}{3})$ is achievable; 3) with $M$ predictors, a linear dependence on $M$ is necessary, even though logarithmic dependence is possible for non-contextual problems. We also develop several novel algorithmic techniques to achieve matching upper bounds, including 1) a key \\emph{action  remapping} technique for optimal regret with known $\\mathcal{E}$, 2) computationally efficient implementation of Catoni\u2019s robust mean estimator via an ERM oracle in the stochastic setting with optimal regret, 3) an underestimator for $\\mathcal{E}$ via estimating the histogram with bins of exponentially increasing size for the stochastic setting with unknown $\\mathcal{E}$, and 4) a self-referential scheme for learning with multiple predictors, all of which might be of independent interest. }\n}",

In particular, the Euclidean Langevin Monte Carlo sampling algorithm has received much attention lately, leading to a detailed understanding of its non-asymptotic convergence properties and of the role that smoothness and log-concavity play in the convergence rate. Distributions that do not possess these regularity properties can be addressed by considering a Riemannian Langevin diffusion with a metric capturing the local geometry of the log-density.

We establish for the first time a non-asymptotic upper-bound on the sampling error of the resulting Hessian Riemannian Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm.
