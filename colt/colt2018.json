        "abstract": "We present preconditioned stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms for the $\\ell_1$ minimization problem $\\min_{\\boldsymbol{\\mathit{x}}}\\|\\boldsymbol{\\mathit{A}} \\boldsymbol{\\mathit{x}} - \\boldsymbol{\\mathit{b}}\\|_1$ in the overdetermined case, where there are far more constraints than variables. Specifically, we have $\\boldsymbol{\\mathit{A}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ for $n \\gg d$. Commonly known as the Least Absolute Deviations problem, $\\ell_1$ regression can be used to solve many important combinatorial problems, such as minimum cut and shortest path. SGD-based algorithms are appealing for their simplicity and practical efficiency. Our primary insight is that careful preprocessing can yield preconditioned matrices $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{\\mathit{A}}}$ with strong properties (besides good condition number and low-dimension) that allow for faster convergence of gradient descent. In particular, we precondition using Lewis weights to obtain an isotropic matrix with fewer rows and strong upper bounds on all row norms. We leverage these conditions to find a good initialization, which we use along with recent smoothing reductions and accelerated stochastic gradient descent algorithms to achieve $\\epsilon$ relative error in $\\widetilde{O}(nnz(\\boldsymbol{\\mathit{A}}) + d^{2.5} \\epsilon^{-2})$ time with high probability, where $nnz(\\boldsymbol{\\mathit{A}})$ is the number of non-zeros in $\\boldsymbol{\\mathit{A}}$. This improves over the previous best result using gradient descent for $\\ell_1$ regression. We also match the best known running times for interior point methods in several settings. Finally, we also show that if our original matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\mathit{A}}$ is approximately isotropic and the row norms are approximately equal, we can give an algorithm that avoids using fast matrix multiplication and obtains a running time of $\\widetilde{O}(nnz(\\boldsymbol{\\mathit{A}}) + s d^{1.5}\\epsilon^{-2} + d^2\\epsilon^{-2})$, where $s$ is the maximum number of non-zeros in a row of $\\boldsymbol{\\mathit{A}}$.

        "abstract": "We consider a simple model of unreliable or crowdsourced data where there is an underlying set of $n$ binary variables, each \u201cevaluator\u201d contributes a (possibly unreliable or adversarial) estimate of the values of some subset of $r$ of the variables, and the learner is given the true value of a \\emph{constant} number of variables.   We show that, provided an $\\alpha$-fraction of the evaluators are \u201cgood\u201d (either correct, or with independent noise rate $p < 1/2$), then the true values of a $(1-\\eps)$ fraction of the $n$ underlying variables can be deduced as long as $r > \\log_{2-2p}(1/\\alpha)$. For example, if the fraction of \u201cgood\u201d evaluators is larger than $1/16$ and there is no noise in their responses, then accurate recovery is possible provided each worker evaluates a random set of $4$ items.  This result is optimal in that if $r \\leq \\log_{2-2p}(1/\\alpha)$ the large dataset can contain no information.   This setting can be viewed as an instance of the  \\emph{semi-verified} learning model introduced by Charikar, Steinhardt, and Valiant, which explores the tradeoff between the number of items evaluated by each worker and the fraction of \u201cgood\u201d evaluators. In the standard adversarial setting, our algorithm requires $\\tilde{O}\\left(n^{\\log_{2-2p}(1/\\alpha)}\\right)$ evaluators. However, the algorithm runs in near linear time, $\\tilde{O}_{r,\\eps}(n)$, and hence would require only a near-linear number of evaluations in the weaker model in which the adversary\u2019s responses to each $r$-tuple of items are independent of the set of evaluations collected.  These settings and results can also be viewed as examining a general class of semi-adversarial CSPs with a planted assignment. This extreme parameter regime, where the fraction of reliable data is small (inverse exponential in the amount of data provided by each source), is relevant to a number of practical settings.  For example, the setting where you collect a dataset on customer preferences, with each customer specifying preferences for a small (constant) number of items, and the goal is to ascertain the preferences of a specific demographic of interest.   Our results show that this large dataset (which lacks demographic information) can be leveraged together with the preferences of the demographic of interest for a \\emph{constant} (polynomial in $1/\\alpha$ but independent of $n$), number of randomly selected items, to recover an accurate estimate of the entire set of preferences, even if the  fraction of the original dataset contributed by the demographic of interest is inverse exponential in the number of preferences supplied by each customer.   In this sense, our results can be viewed as a \u201cdata prism\u201d allowing one to extract the behavior of specific cohorts from a large, mixed, dataset.",

This happens due to \u201cmodel error,\u201d i.e., when the true data generating distribution does not fit within the class of generative models being learned. To address this, we propose a model of active distribution learning using a binary invalidity oracle that identifies some examples as clearly invalid, together with random positive examples sampled from the true distribution. The goal is to maximize the likelihood of the positive examples subject to the constraint of (almost) never generating examples labeled invalid by the oracle. Guarantees are agnostic compared to a class of probability distributions. We first show that proper learning may require exponentially many queries to the invalidity oracle. We then give an improper distribution learning algorithm that uses only polynomially many queries.",

Crucial to these applications has been an analysis of how quickly solutions to the penalized program approach true optima to the original linear program.  More than 20 years ago, Cominetti and San Mart\u00edn showed that this convergence is exponentially fast; however, their proof is asymptotic and does not give any indication of how accurately the entropic program approximates the original program for any particular choice of the penalization parameter.

Our results show that under mild regularity conditions, the communication constraint reduces the effective sample size by a factor of $d$ when $k$ is small, where $d$ is the dimension of the estimated parameter. Furthermore, this penalty reduces at most exponentially with increasing $k$, which is the case for some models, e.g., estimating high-dimensional distributions. For other models however, we show that the sample size reduction is re-mediated only linearly with increasing $k$, e.g. when some sub-Gaussian structure is available.

We show that this leads to new trade-offs for information and regret, which are not taken into account by existing approaches like upper confidence bound algorithms (UCB) or Thompson Sampling.

From this bound, we define a frequentist version of Information Directed Sampling (IDS) to minimize the regret-information ratio over all possible action sampling distributions.

Rather than a uniform average of the iterates, we consider a weighted average, with weights decaying in a geometric fashion.

        "author": "Belinda Tzen; Tengyuan Liang; Maxim Raginsky",
        "abstract": "We study the detailed path-wise behavior of the discrete-time Langevin algorithm for non-convex Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) through the lens of metastability, adopting some techniques from Berglund and Gentz (2003). For a particular local optimum of the empirical risk, with an \\textit{arbitrary initialization}, we show that, with high probability, at least one of the following two events will occur: (1) the Langevin trajectory ends up somewhere outside the $\\varepsilon$-neighborhood of this particular optimum within a short \\textit{recurrence time}; (2) it enters this $\\varepsilon$-neighborhood by the recurrence time and stays there until a potentially exponentially long \\textit{escape time}. We call this phenomenon \\textit{empirical metastability}. This two-timescale characterization aligns nicely with the existing literature in the following two senses.

For a particular local optimum of the empirical risk, with an \\textit{arbitrary initialization}, we show that, with high probability, at least one of the following two events will occur: (1) the Langevin trajectory ends up somewhere outside the $\\varepsilon$-neighborhood of this particular optimum within a short \\textit{recurrence time}; (2) it enters this $\\varepsilon$-neighborhood by the recurrence time and stays there until a potentially exponentially long \\textit{escape time}. We call this phenomenon \\textit{empirical metastability}. This two-timescale characterization aligns nicely with the existing literature in the following two senses. First, the effective recurrence time (i.e., number of iterations multiplied by stepsize) is dimension-independent, and resembles the convergence time of continuous-time deterministic Gradient Descent (GD). However unlike GD, the Langevin algorithm does not require strong conditions on local initialization, and has the possibility of eventually visiting all optima.

This characterization is achieved by bringing the full power of the Burkholder Method\u2014originally developed for certifying probabilistic martingale inequalities\u2014to bear on the online learning setting.

Many algorithms are known to achieve the minimax optimal order of $O(\\sqrt{T \\log n})$ in \\textit{expectation} for both regret and number of switches, where $T$ is the number of iterations and $n$ the number of actions. However, no \\textit{high probability} guarantees are known. Our main technical contribution is the first algorithms which with high probability achieve this optimal order for both regret and number of switches. This settles an open problem of [Devroye et al., 2015], directly implies the first high probability guarantees for several problems of interest, and is efficiently adaptable to the related problem of online combinatorial optimization with limited switching. \\par Next, to investigate the value of switching actions at a more granular level, we introduce the setting of \\textit{switching budgets}, in which the algorithm is limited to $S \\leq T$ switches between actions. This entails a limited number of free switches, in contrast to the unlimited number of expensive switches allowed in the switching cost setting. Using the above result and several reductions, we unify previous work and completely characterize the complexity of this switching budget setting up to small polylogarithmic factors: for both the PFE and MAB problems, for all switching budgets $S \\leq T$, and for both expectation and high probability guarantees. For PFE, we show that the optimal rate is of order $\\tilde{\\Theta}(\\sqrt{T\\log n})$ for $S = \\Omega(\\sqrt{T\\log n})$, and $\\min(\\tilde{\\Theta}(\\tfrac{T\\log n}{S}), T)$ for $S = O(\\sqrt{T \\log n})$.

Our goal is to test without know- ing the parameter values of the underlying models: only the structure of dependencies is known. We develop a new approach that applies to both the Ising and Exponential Random Graph settings based on a general and natural statistical test. The test can dis- tinguish the hypotheses with high probability above a certain threshold in the (inverse) temperature parameter, and is optimal in that below the threshold no test can distinguish the hypotheses. The thresholds do not correspond to the presence of long-range order in the models. By aggregating information at a global scale, our test works even at very high temperatures. The proofs are based on distributional approximation and sharp concentration of quadratic forms, when restricted to Hamming spheres. The restriction to Hamming spheres is necessary, since otherwise any scalar statistic is useless without explicit knowledge of the temperature parameter. At the same time, this restriction changes the behavior of the functions under consideration, making it hard to directly apply standard methods (i.e., Stein\u2019s method) for concentration of weakly dependent variables. Instead, we carry out an additional tensorization argument using a Markov chain that respects the symmetry of the Hamming sphere.",

At the same time, in many applications it is not necessary to expose the model itself. Instead users may be allowed to query the prediction model on their inputs only through an appropriate interface. Here we formulate the problem of ensuring privacy of individual predictions and investigate the overheads required to achieve it in several standard models of classification and regression. We first describe a simple baseline approach based on training several models on disjoint subsets of data and using standard private aggregation techniques to predict. We show that this approach has nearly optimal sample complexity for (realizable) PAC learning of any class of Boolean functions. At the same time, without strong assumptions on the data distribution, the aggregation step introduces a substantial overhead. We demonstrate that this overhead can be avoided for the well-studied class of thresholds on a line and for a number of standard settings of convex regression.

Methods based on $\\ell_1$-relaxation, such as Lasso, are very popular for sparse recovery in these settings. Restricted Eigenvalue (RE) condition is among the weakest, and hence the most general, condition in literature imposed on the Gram matrix that guarantees nice statistical properties for the Lasso estimator. It is hence natural to ask: what families of matrices satisfy the RE condition?  Following a line of work in this area, we construct a new broad ensemble of dependent random design matrices that have an explicit RE bound. Our construction starts with a fixed (deterministic) matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ satisfying a simple stable rank condition, and we show that a matrix drawn from the distribution $X \\Phi^\\top \\Phi$, where $\\Phi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times d}$ is a subgaussian random matrix, with high probability, satisfies the RE condition. This construction allows incorporating a fixed matrix that has an easily {\\em verifiable} condition into the design process, and allows for generation of {\\em compressed} design matrices that have a lower storage requirement than a standard design matrix. We give two applications of this construction to sparse linear regression problems, including one to a compressed sparse regression setting where the regression algorithm only has access to a compressed representation of a fixed design matrix $X$.",

In pursuit of low-rank solutions and low complexity algorithms, we consider the Burer\u2013Monteiro factorization approach for solving SDPs. For a large class of SDPs, upon random perturbation of the cost matrix, with high probability, we show that all approximate second-order stationary points are approximate global optima for the penalty formulation of appropriately rank-constrained SDPs, as long as the number of constraints scales sub-quadratically with the desired rank.

Recently, concerns have been raised about whether the process of exploration could be viewed as unfair, placing too much burden on certain individuals or groups.  Motivated by these concerns, we initiate the study of the externalities of exploration\u2014the undesirable side effects that the presence of one party may impose on another\u2014under the linear contextual bandits model.  We introduce the notion of a group externality, measuring the extent to which the presence of one population of users (the majority) impacts the rewards of another (the minority). We show that this impact can, in some cases, be negative, and that, in a certain sense, no algorithm can avoid it.  We then move on to study externalities at the individual level, interpreting the act of exploration as an externality imposed on the current user of a system by future users. This drives us to ask under what conditions inherent diversity in the data makes explicit exploration unnecessary.  We build on a recent line of work on the smoothed analysis of the greedy algorithm that always chooses the action that currently looks optimal. We improve on prior results to show that a greedy approach almost matches the best possible Bayesian regret rate of any other algorithm on the same problem instance whenever the diversity conditions hold, and that this regret is at most $\\tilde{O}(T^{1/3})$. Returning to group-level effects, we show that under the same conditions, negative group externalities essentially vanish if one runs the greedy algorithm.

        "abstract": "The mean field approximation to the Ising model is a canonical variational tool that is used for analysis and inference in Ising models. We provide a simple and optimal bound for the KL error of the mean field approximation for Ising models on general graphs, and extend it to higher order Markov random fields. Our bound improves on previous bounds obtained in work in the graph limit literature by Borgs, Chayes, Lov{\u00e1}sz, S{\u00f3}s, and Vesztergombi and recent works by Basak and Mukherjee, and Eldan. Our bound is tight up to lower order terms.  Building on the methods used to prove the bound, along with techniques from combinatorics and optimization,  we study the algorithmic problem of estimating the (variational) free energy for Ising models and general Markov random fields. For a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and interaction matrix $J$ with Frobenius norm $\\|{J} \\|_F$, we provide algorithms that approximate the free energy within an additive error of $\\epsilon n \\|J\\|_F$ in time $\\exp(poly(1/\\epsilon))$.

Classical results in statistical physics show how, given an analytic formula of the free energy, it is possible to compute many key quantities associated with Markov random fields including quantities such as magnetization and the location of various phase transitions.

Results in the graph limit literature by Borgs, Chayes, Lov{\u00e1}sz, S{\u00f3}s, and Vesztergombi show that  for Ising models on $n$ nodes and interactions of strength $\\Theta(1/n)$, an $\\epsilon$ approximation to $\\log Z_n / n$ can be achieved by sampling a randomly induced model on $2^{O(1/\\epsilon^2)}$ nodes.
