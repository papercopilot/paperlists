        "abstract": "Significant progression has been made in active learning algorithms for graph networks in various tasks. However real-world applications frequently involve incomplete graphs with missing links, which pose the challenge that existing approaches might not adequately address. This paper presents an active learning approach tailored specifically for handling incomplete graphs, termed ALIN.

Our approach assumes that the density function is relatively stable (with lower variance) around normal samples. We have verified this hypothesis empirically using a wide range of real-world data. Then, we present a variance-stabilized density estimation problem for maximizing the likelihood of the observed samples while minimizing the variance of the density around normal samples. To obtain a reliable anomaly detector, we introduce a spectral ensemble of autoregressive models for learning the variance-stabilized distribution.

In this paper, we develop an algorithm, that we call AutoDrop, that realizes the learning rate drop automatically and stems from the properties of the learning dynamics of DL systems. Specifically, it is motivated by the observation that the angular velocity of the model parameters, i.e., the velocity of the changes of the convergence direction, for a fixed learning rate initially increases rapidly and then progresses towards soft saturation. At saturation, the optimizer slows down thus the angular velocity saturation is a good indicator for dropping the learning rate.

        "abstract": "Classic no-regret multi-armed bandit algorithms, including the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), Hedge, and EXP3, are inherently unfair by design. Their unfairness stems from their objective of playing the most rewarding arm as frequently as possible while ignoring the rest. In this paper, we consider a fair prediction problem in the stochastic setting with a guaranteed minimum rate of accrual of rewards for each arm. We study the problem in both full-information and bandit feedback settings. Combining queueing-theoretic techniques with adversarial bandits, we propose a new online policy called BanditQ that achieves the target reward rates while conceding a regret and target rate violation penalty of at most $O(T^{\\frac{3}{4}}).$ The regret bound in the full-information setting can be further improved to $O(\\sqrt{T})$ under either a monotonicity assumption or when considering time-averaged regret.

Their unfairness stems from their objective of playing the most rewarding arm as frequently as possible while ignoring the rest. In this paper, we consider a fair prediction problem in the stochastic setting with a guaranteed minimum rate of accrual of rewards for each arm. We study the problem in both full-information and bandit feedback settings. Combining queueing-theoretic techniques with adversarial bandits, we propose a new online policy called BanditQ that achieves the target reward rates while conceding a regret and target rate violation penalty of at most $O(T^{\\frac{3}{4}}).$ The regret bound in the full-information setting can be further improved to $O(\\sqrt{T})$ under either a monotonicity assumption or when considering time-averaged regret.

However, they often suffer from slow inference times. To address this challenge, Bayesian Pseudo-Coresets (BPC) have emerged as a promising solution. BPC methods aim to create a small synthetic dataset, known as pseudo-coresets, that approximates the posterior inference achieved with the original dataset. This approximation is achieved by optimizing a divergence measure between the true posterior and the pseudo-coreset posterior. Various divergence measures have been proposed for constructing pseudo-coresets, with forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence being the most successful.

Evidential deep learning methods address this by treating target distribution parameters as random variables with a learnable conjugate distribution, enabling efficient UQ. However, there\u2019s debate over whether these methods can accurately estimate epistemic uncertainty due to their single-network, sampling-free nature. In this paper, we combine the strengths of both approaches by distilling BNN knowledge into a Dirichlet-based model, endowing it with a Bayesian perspective and theoretical guarantees. Additionally, we introduce two enhancements to further improve the integration of Bayesian UQ with Dirichlet-based models. To relax the heavy computational load with BNNs, we introduce a self-regularized training strategy using Laplacian approximation (LA) for self-distillation. To alleviate the conjugate prior assumption, we employ an expressive normalizing flow for refining the model in a post-processing manner, where a few training iterations can enhance model performance.

Additionally, we introduce two enhancements to further improve the integration of Bayesian UQ with Dirichlet-based models. To relax the heavy computational load with BNNs, we introduce a self-regularized training strategy using Laplacian approximation (LA) for self-distillation. To alleviate the conjugate prior assumption, we employ an expressive normalizing flow for refining the model in a post-processing manner, where a few training iterations can enhance model performance. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed methods in both UQ accuracy and robustness.}\n}",

        "abstract": "Boolean matrix factorization (BMF) has been widely utilized in fields such as recommendation systems, graph learning, text mining, and -omics data analysis. Traditional BMF methods decompose a binary matrix into the Boolean product of two lower-rank Boolean matrices plus homoscedastic random errors. However, real-world binary data typically involves biases arising from heterogeneous row- and column-wise signal distributions. Such biases can lead to suboptimal fitting and unexplainable predictions if not accounted for. In this study, we reconceptualize the binary data generation as the Boolean sum of three components: a binary pattern matrix, a background bias matrix influenced by heterogeneous row or column distributions, and random flipping errors. We introduce a novel Disentangled Representation Learning for Binary matrices (DRLB) method, which employs a dual auto-encoder network to reveal the true patterns. DRLB can be seamlessly integrated with existing BMF techniques to facilitate bias-aware BMF. Our experiments with both synthetic and real-world datasets show that DRLB significantly enhances the precision of traditional BMF methods while offering high scalability. Moreover, the bias matrix detected by DRLB accurately reflects the inherent biases in synthetic data, and the patterns identified in the bias-corrected real-world data exhibit enhanced interpretability.",

The value of information obtained by asking the user\u2019s rating on an item is quantified by the distance from the region center embedding space that contains with high confidence the true embedding value of the user.

MAML learns the new task from meta-initialization parameters with an inner update and finds the meta-initialization parameters in the outer loop. In general, the injection of noise into the gradient of the model for augmenting the gradient is one of the widely used regularization methods. In this work, we propose a novel cooperative meta-learning framework dubbed CML which leverages gradient-level regularization with gradient augmentation. We inject learnable noise into the gradient of the model for the model generalization. The key idea of CML is introducing the co-learner which has no inner update but the outer loop update to augment gradients for finding better meta-initialization parameters. Since the co-learner does not update in the inner loop, it can be easily deleted after meta-training. Therefore, CML infers with only meta-learner without additional cost and performance degradation. We demonstrate that CML is easily applicable to gradient-based meta-learning methods and CML leads to increased performance in few-shot regression, few-shot image classification and few-shot node classification tasks.

In this work, we propose a novel cooperative meta-learning framework dubbed CML which leverages gradient-level regularization with gradient augmentation. We inject learnable noise into the gradient of the model for the model generalization. The key idea of CML is introducing the co-learner which has no inner update but the outer loop update to augment gradients for finding better meta-initialization parameters. Since the co-learner does not update in the inner loop, it can be easily deleted after meta-training. Therefore, CML infers with only meta-learner without additional cost and performance degradation. We demonstrate that CML is easily applicable to gradient-based meta-learning methods and CML leads to increased performance in few-shot regression, few-shot image classification and few-shot node classification tasks.

We derive minimum thresholding requirements to prevent performance degradation and define metrics to assess the applicability of uncertainty for failure recognition.

In practical applications, it is important for DNNs to have both high standard accuracy and robustness against out-of-distribution domains. One technique that achieves both of these improvements is disentangled learning with mixture distribution via auxiliary batch normalization layers (ABNs). This technique treats clean and transformed samples as different domains, allowing a DNN to learn better features from mixed domains. However, if we distinguish the domains of the samples based on entropy, we find that some transformed samples are drawn from the same domain as clean samples, and these samples are not completely different domains. To generate samples drawn from a completely different domain than clean samples, we hypothesize that transforming clean high-entropy samples to further increase the entropy generates out-of-distribution samples that are much further away from the in-distribution domain. On the basis of the hypothesis, we propose high entropy propagation\u00a0(EntProp), which feeds high-entropy samples to the network that uses ABNs. We introduce two techniques, data augmentation and free adversarial training, that increase entropy and bring the sample further away from the in-distribution domain.

The intrinsic geometric boundaries and adjacency of the Voronoi graph assist in fine-tuning the trajectory of local BO sampling.

In practice, save some special inference tasks, one averages over a sample of DAGs generated perfectly or approximately from the posterior. For the hard problem of perfect sampling, we give an algorithm that runs in $O(2.829^n)$ expected time, getting below $O(3^n)$ for the first time.

The goal is to compute a hypothesis regressor consistent with the underlying instance-labels.

RMABs have applications in cellular networks, anti-poaching, and in particular, healthcare. For such high-stakes use cases, allocations are often required to treat different groups of agents (e.g., defined by sensitive attributes) fairly. In addition to the fairness challenge, agents\u2019 transition probabilities are often unknown and need to be learned in real-world problems.   Thus, group fairness in RMABs requires us to simultaneously learn transition probabilities and how much budget we allocate to each group. Overcoming this key challenge ignored by previous work, we develop a decision-focused-learning pipeline to solve equitable RMABs, using a novel budget allocation algorithm to prevent disparity between groups. Our results on both synthetic and real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that incorporating fair planning into the learning step greatly improves equity with little sacrifice in utility.",

Its inherent NP-hardness has fostered considerable efforts towards the development of heuristic strategies. An emerging approach involves leveraging data-driven methods to automatically learn these heuristics. For example, using deep (reinforcement) learning to recurrently reoptimize an initial solution with Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) has demonstrated exceptional performance across numerous applications. A pivotal challenge within LNS lies in identifying an optimal subset of variables for reoptimization at each stage. Existing methods typically learn a policy to select a subset, either by maintaining a fixed cardinality or by decomposing the subset into independent binary decisions for each variable.

To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce ILP-FORMER, an innovative model that reimagines policy learning as a sequence-to-multi-label classification (MLC) problem.

However, noisy labels often have a serious negative impact on label integration. In this case, most existing works always focus on designing more complex label integration methods to infer unknown true labels more accurately from multiple noisy labels, but little attention has been paid to another perspective, i.e., purifying noisy labels before label integration. In this paper, we aim to purify noisy labels for existing label integration methods and propose a label consistency-based worker filtering (LCWF) algorithm. In LCWF, we consider that if all low-quality workers are filtered out and only high-quality workers remain, the label consistency should be high. Therefore, we utilize label consistency to filter out low-quality workers. Firstly, we directly transform the worker filtering problem into a discrete optimization problem and utilize label consistency to define the fitness function for this problem. Then, we search for the optimal solution to this problem by a genetic algorithm. Finally, we filter out all labels from low-quality workers according to the optimal solution we obtained.

In this study, we focus on the distributionally robust learning of continuous TPMs and address the challenge of distribution shift at test time by tackling the adversarial risk minimization problem within the framework of distributionally robust learning. Specifically, we demonstrate that the adversarial risk minimization problem can be efficiently addressed when the model permits exact log-likelihood evaluation and efficient learning on weighted data.

To address this, we propose *local discovery by partitioning* (LDP): a local causal discovery method that is tailored for downstream inference tasks without requiring parametric and pretreatment assumptions.

Asymptotic theoretical guarantees are numerically validated on synthetic graphs. Adjustment sets from LDP yield less biased and more precise average treatment effect estimates than baseline discovery algorithms, with LDP outperforming on confounder recall, runtime, and test count for VAS discovery.

        "abstract": "A neural architecture with randomly initialized weights, in the infinite width limit, is equivalent to a Gaussian Random Field whose covariance function is the so-called Neural Network Gaussian Process kernel (NNGP). We prove that a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) defined by the NNGP contains only functions that can be approximated by the architecture. To achieve a certain approximation error the required number of neurons in each layer is defined by the RKHS norm of the target function.

        "abstract": "Although recent advances in machine learning have shown its success to learn from independent and identically distributed (IID) data, it is vulnerable to out-of-distribution (OOD) data in an open world. Domain generalization (DG) deals with such an issue and it aims to learn a model from multiple source domains that can be generalized to unseen target domains. Existing studies on DG have largely focused on stationary settings with homogeneous source domains. However, in many applications,  domains may evolve along a specific direction (e.g., time, space).

Domain generalization (DG) deals with such an issue and it aims to learn a model from multiple source domains that can be generalized to unseen target domains. Existing studies on DG have largely focused on stationary settings with homogeneous source domains. However, in many applications,  domains may evolve along a specific direction (e.g., time, space).

Next, we study synthetic recommendation problems with known but latent item utilities, and frame them as Partially Observed Decision Processes (PODP).

When the number of facilities is $m>1$, the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of the FCFS game is not unique, thus the utility of the agents and the notion of truthfulness are not well-defined. To address these issues, we consider absolutely truthful mechanisms, i.e. mechanisms able to prevent agents from misreporting regardless of the strategies played during the FCFS game. We pair this more stringent truthfulness requirement with the notion of Equilibrium Stable (ES) mechanism, i.e. mechanisms whose Social Welfare does not depend on the NE of the FCFS game. We show that the class of percentile mechanisms is absolutely truthful and characterize under which conditions they are ES.

In this work, we analytically study the effect of standard DP-based regularization methods on the conditional distribution of the predicted label given the sensitive attribute. Our analysis shows that an imbalanced training dataset with a non-uniform distribution of the sensitive attribute could lead to a classification rule biased toward the sensitive attribute outcome holding the majority of training data.

A major limitation of the AMDP formalism, however, is pessimistic regret analysis results in the sense that although the cost function can change from one episode to the next, the evolution in many settings is not adversarial. To address this, we introduce and study a new variant of AMDP, which aims to minimize regret while utilizing a set of cost predictors. For this setting, we develop a new policy search method that achieves a sublinear optimistic regret with high probability, that is a regret bound which gracefully degrades with the estimation power of the cost predictors. Establishing such optimistic regret bounds is nontrivial given that (i) as we demonstrate, the existing importance-weighted cost estimators cannot establish optimistic bounds, and (ii) the feedback model of AMDP is different (and more realistic) than the existing optimistic online learning works. Our result, in particular, hinges upon developing a novel optimistically biased cost estimator that leverages cost predictors and enables a high-probability regret analysis without imposing restrictive assumptions. We further discuss practical extensions of the proposed scheme and demonstrate its efficacy numerically.",

To address this problem, techniques such as graph coarsening, condensation, and summarization have been developed to create a coarsened graph while preserving important properties of the original graph by considering both the graph matrix and the feature or attribute matrix of the original graph as inputs. However, existing graph coarsening techniques often neglect the label information during the coarsening process, which can result in a lower-quality coarsened graph and limit its suitability for downstream tasks.  To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Label-Aware Graph Coarsening (LAGC) algorithm, a semi-supervised approach that incorporates the graph matrix, feature matrix, and some of the node label information to learn a coarsened graph.

However, they are mostly designed for continuous outputs and are unsuitable for scenarios where discrete values are necessary. Although various quantization mechanisms were proposed recently to generate discrete outputs under differential privacy, the outcomes are either biased or have an inferior accuracy-privacy trade-off. In this paper, we propose a family of quantization mechanisms that is unbiased and differentially private. It has a high degree of freedom and we show that some existing mechanisms can be considered as special cases of ours.

        "author": "Aditya Challa; Soma Dhavala; Snehanshu Saha",
        "abstract": "Quantification of Uncertainty in predictions is a challenging problem. In the classification settings, although deep learning based models generalize well, class probabilities often lack reliability. Calibration errors are used to quantify uncertainty, and several methods exist to minimize calibration error. We argue that between the choice of having a minimum calibration error on original distribution which increases across distortions or having a (possibly slightly higher) calibration error which is constant across distortions, we prefer the latter We hypothesize that the reason for unreliability of deep networks is - The way neural networks are currently trained, the probabilities do not generalize across small distortions. We observe that quantile based approaches can potentially solve this problem.

In the classification settings, although deep learning based models generalize well, class probabilities often lack reliability.

We argue that between the choice of having a minimum calibration error on original distribution which increases across distortions or having a (possibly slightly higher) calibration error which is constant across distortions, we prefer the latter We hypothesize that the reason for unreliability of deep networks is - The way neural networks are currently trained, the probabilities do not generalize across small distortions.

This work introduces Random Linear Projections (RLP) loss, a novel approach that enhances training efficiency by leveraging geometric relationships within the data. Distinct from traditional loss functions that target minimizing pointwise errors, RLP loss operates by minimizing the distance between sets of hyperplanes connecting fixed-size subsets of feature-prediction pairs and feature-label pairs. Our empirical evaluations, conducted across benchmark datasets and synthetic examples, demonstrate that neural networks trained with RLP loss outperform those trained with traditional loss functions, achieving improved performance with fewer data samples, and exhibiting greater robustness to additive noise.

This work introduces Random Linear Projections (RLP) loss, a novel approach that enhances training efficiency by leveraging geometric relationships within the data. Distinct from traditional loss functions that target minimizing pointwise errors, RLP loss operates by minimizing the distance between sets of hyperplanes connecting fixed-size subsets of feature-prediction pairs and feature-label pairs. Our empirical evaluations, conducted across benchmark datasets and synthetic examples, demonstrate that neural networks trained with RLP loss outperform those trained with traditional loss functions, achieving improved performance with fewer data samples, and exhibiting greater robustness to additive noise.

Constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (C-POMDP) model this case with transition uncertainty and partial observability.

To address these drawbacks, we introduce the Recursively-Constrained POMDP (RC-POMDP), which imposes additional history-dependent cost constraints on the C-POMDP.

Our analysis yields a probabilistic convergence rate which, under the general noise, could reach at $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\sqrt{T})$.

We empirically demonstrate its benefits in experiments on synthetic and real-life data. The results show that RES reliably finds robust optima, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms.}\n}",

However, the efficacy of RFFs in kernel approximation and Bayesian kernel learning depends on the ability to tractably sample the kernel spectral measure and the quality of the generated samples. We introduce Stein random features (SRF), leveraging Stein variational gradient descent, which can be used to both generate high-quality RFF samples of known spectral densities as well as flexibly and efficiently approximate traditionally non-analytical spectral measure posteriors.

Then, we decouple the feature space (eliminating correlations among features) by modeling a weight assigner that is learned on this clean sample set, thus assigning weights to each sample of the original dataset.

The Gaussian Process (GP) offer a kernel-based framework that predicts and quantifies associated uncertainties. However, kernel-based methods often underperform ensemble-based decision tree approaches in regression tasks involving tabular and categorical data. Recently, Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs) were proposed as a novel feature-learning kernel which strengthens the capabilities of kernel machines. In this study, we harness the power of these RFMs in a probabilistic GP-based approach to enhance uncertainty estimation through feature extraction within kernel methods. We employ this learned kernel for in-depth uncertainty analysis. On tabular datasets, our RFM-based method surpasses other leading uncertainty estimation techniques, including NGBoost and CatBoost-ensemble.

The Gaussian Process (GP) offer a kernel-based framework that predicts and quantifies associated uncertainties. However, kernel-based methods often underperform ensemble-based decision tree approaches in regression tasks involving tabular and categorical data. Recently, Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs) were proposed as a novel feature-learning kernel which strengthens the capabilities of kernel machines. In this study, we harness the power of these RFMs in a probabilistic GP-based approach to enhance uncertainty estimation through feature extraction within kernel methods. We employ this learned kernel for in-depth uncertainty analysis. On tabular datasets, our RFM-based method surpasses other leading uncertainty estimation techniques, including NGBoost and CatBoost-ensemble.

        "abstract": "The goal of Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is recovering a posterior distribution over reward functions using a set of demonstrations from an expert optimizing for a reward unknown to the learner. The resulting posterior over rewards can then be used to synthesize an apprentice policy that performs well on the same or a similar task. A key challenge in Bayesian IRL is bridging the computational gap between the hypothesis space of possible rewards and the likelihood, often defined in terms of Q values: vanilla Bayesian IRL needs to solve the costly forward planning problem \u2013 going from rewards to the Q values \u2013 at every step of the algorithm, which may need to be done thousands of times. We propose to solve this by a simple change: instead of focusing on primarily sampling in the space of rewards, we can focus on primarily working in the space of Q-values, since the computation required to go from Q-values to reward is radically cheaper. Furthermore, this reversion of the computation makes it easy to compute the gradient allowing efficient sampling using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We propose ValueWalk \u2013 a new Markov chain Monte Carlo method based on this insight \u2013 and illustrate its advantages on several tasks.",

        "abstract": "A common type of zero-inflated data has certain true values incorrectly replaced by zeros due to data recording conventions (rare outcomes assumed to be absent) or details of data recording equipment (e.g. artificial zeros in gene expression data). Existing methods for zero-inflated data either fit the observed data likelihood via parametric mixture models that explicitly represent excess zeros, or aim to replace excess zeros by imputed values.  If the goal of the analysis relies on knowing true data realizations, a particular challenge with zero-inflated data is identifiability, since it is difficult to correctly determine which observed zeros are real and which are inflated. This paper views zero-inflated data as a general type of missing data problem, where the observability indicator for a potentially censored variable is itself unobserved whenever a zero is recorded. We show that, without additional assumptions, target parameters involving a zero-inflated variable are not identified. However, if a proxy of the missingness indicator is observed, a modification of the effect restoration approach of Kuroki and Pearl allows identification and estimation, given the proxy-indicator relationship is known. If this relationship is unknown, our approach yields a partial identification strategy for sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we show that only certain proxy-indicator relationships are compatible with the observed data distribution. We give an analytic bound for this relationship in cases with a categorical outcome, which is sharp in certain models. For more complex cases, sharp numerical bounds may be computed using methods in Duarte et al. [2023].

In order to aggregate the information from the backbone and binary filter, we introduce an adapter to merge local features into the transformer framework.
