        "abstract": "Panoramic 360\u00ba images taken under unconstrained conditions present a significant challenge to current state-of-the-art recognition pipelines, since the assumption of a mostly upright camera is no longer valid. In this work, we investigate how to solve this problem by fusing purely geometric cues, such as apparent vanishing points, with learned semantic cues, such as the expectation that some visual elements (e.g. doors) have a natural upright position. We train a deep neural network to leverage these cues to segment the image-space endpoints of an imagined \u201cvertical axis\u201d, which is orthogonal to the ground plane of a scene, thus levelling the camera. We show that our segmentation-based strategy significantly increases performance, reducing errors by half, compared to the current state-of-the-art on two datasets of 360\u00ba imagery. We also demonstrate the importance of 360\u00ba camera levelling by analysing its impact on downstream tasks, finding that incorrect levelling severely degrades the performance of real-world computer vision pipelines.\"",

Movements carry important social cues, but current methods are not able to robustly estimate pose and shape of animals, particularly for social animals such as birds, which are often occluded by each other and objects in the environment. To address this problem, we first introduce a model and multi-view optimization approach, which we use to capture the unique shape and pose space displayed by live birds. We then introduce a pipeline and experiments for keypoint, mask, pose, and shape regression that recovers accurate avian postures from single views. Finally, we provide extensive multi-view keypoint and mask annotations collected from a group of 15 social birds housed together in an outdoor aviary.

Polarization images are known to be able to capture polarized reflected lights that preserve rich geometric cues of an object, which has motivated its recent applications in reconstructing surface normal of the objects of interest. Inspired by the recent advances in human shape estimation from single color images, in this paper, we attempt at estimating human body shapes by leveraging the geometric cues from single polarization images. A dedicated two-stage deep learning approach, SfP, is proposed: given a polarization image, stage one aims at inferring the fined-detailed body surface normal; stage two gears to reconstruct the 3D body shape of clothing details. Empirical evaluations on a synthetic dataset (SURREAL) as well as a real-world dataset (PHSPD) demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative performance of our approach in estimating human poses and shapes. This indicates polarization camera is a promising alternative to the more conventional color or depth imaging for human shape estimation. Further, normal maps inferred from polarization imaging play a significant role in accurately recovering the body shapes of clothed people. \"",

        "abstract": "3D human shape and pose estimation from monocular images has been an active area of research in computer vision, having a substantial impact on the development of new applications, from activity recognition to creating virtual avatars. Existing deep learning methods for 3D human shape and pose estimation rely on relatively high-resolution input images; however, high-resolution visual content is not always available in several practical scenarios such as video surveillance and sports broadcasting. Low-resolution images in real scenarios can vary in a wide range of sizes, and a model trained in one resolution does not typically degrade gracefully across resolutions. Two common approaches to solve the problem of low-resolution input are applying super-resolution techniques to the input images which may result in visual artifacts, or simply training one model for each resolution, which is impractical in many realistic applications. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a novel algorithm called RSC-Net, which consists of a Resolution-aware network, a Self-supervision loss, and a Contrastive learning scheme. The proposed network is able to learn the 3D body shape and pose across different resolutions with a single model. The self-supervision loss encourages scale-consistency of the output, and the contrastive learning scheme enforces scale-consistency of the deep features. We show that both these new training losses provide robustness when learning 3D shape and pose in a weakly-supervised manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the RSC-Net can achieve consistently better results than the state-of-the-art methods for challenging low-resolution images.\"",

To do this, we introduce a deep network architecture that is specifically designed for volumetric TSDF data by featuring a specific tree net architecture. Our framework can handle a 3D resolution of $512^3$ by introducing a dedicated compression technique based on a modified autoencoder. Furthermore, we introduce a novel loss shaping technique for 3D data that guides the learning process towards regions where free and occupied space are close to each other.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new deep architecture for fusing camera and LiDAR sensors for 3D object detection. Because the camera and LiDAR sensor signals have different characteristics and distributions, fusing these two modalities is expected to improve both the accuracy and robustness of 3D object detection. One of the challenges presented by the fusion of cameras and LiDAR is that the spatial feature maps obtained from each modality are represented by significantly different views in the camera and world coordinates; hence, it is not an easy task to combine two heterogeneous feature maps without loss of information. To address this problem, we propose a method called 3D-CVF that combines the camera and LiDAR features using the cross-view spatial feature fusion strategy. First, the method employs auto-calibrated projection, to transform the 2D camera features to a smooth spatial feature map with the highest correspondence to the LiDAR features in the bird's eye view (BEV) domain. Then, a gated feature fusion network is applied to use the spatial attention maps to mix the camera and LiDAR features appropriately according to the region. Next, camera-LiDAR feature fusion is also achieved in the subsequent proposal refinement stage. The low-level LiDAR features and camera features are separately pooled using region of interest (RoI)-based feature pooling and fused with the joint camera-LiDAR features for enhanced proposal refinement. Our evaluation, conducted on the KITTI and nuScenes 3D object detection datasets, demonstrates that the camera-LiDAR fusion offers significant performance gain over the LiDAR-only baseline and that the proposed 3D-CVF achieves state-of-the-art performance in the KITTI benchmark.\"",

Towards this aim, we use Bingham distributions, to model the orientation of the camera pose, and a multivariate Gaussian to model the position, with an end-to-end deep neural network. By incorporating a Winner-Takes-All training scheme, we finally obtain a mixture model that is well suited for explaining ambiguities in the scene, yet does not suffer from mode collapse, a common problem with mixture density networks.

Such a partial transfer setting is realistic but challenging and existing methods always suffer from two key problems, negative transfer and uncertainty propagation. In this paper, we build on domain adversarial learning and propose a novel domain adaptation method BA$^3$US with two new techniques termed Balanced Adversarial Alignment (BAA) and Adaptive Uncertainty Suppression (AUS), respectively. On one hand, negative transfer results in misclassification of target samples to the classes only present in the source domain. To address this issue, BAA pursues the balance between label distributions across domains in a fairly simple manner. Specifically, it randomly leverages a few source samples to augment the smaller target domain during domain alignment so that classes in different domains are symmetric. On the other hand, a source sample would be denoted as uncertain if there is an incorrect class that has a relatively high prediction score, and such uncertainty easily propagates to unlabeled target data around it during alignment, which severely deteriorates adaptation performance. Thus we present AUS that emphasizes uncertain samples and exploits an adaptive weighted complement entropy objective to encourage incorrect classes to have uniform and low prediction scores. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate our BA$^3$US surpasses state-of-the-arts for partial domain adaptation tasks.

Using a gating mechanism that discriminates the unseen samples from the seen samples can decompose the GZSL problem to a conventional Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) problem and a supervised classification problem. However, training the gate is usually challenging due to the lack of data in the unseen domain. To resolve this problem, in this paper, we propose a boundary based Out-of-Distribution (OOD) classifier which classifies the unseen and seen domains by only using seen samples for training. First, we learn a shared latent space on a unit hyper-sphere where the latent distributions of visual features and semantic attributes are aligned class-wisely. Then we find the boundary and the center of the manifold for each class. By leveraging the class centers and boundaries, the unseen samples can be separated from the seen samples. After that, we use two experts to classify the seen and unseen samples separately. We extensively validate our approach on five popular benchmark datasets including AWA1, AWA2, CUB, FLO and SUN.

        "abstract": "Recent progress on few-shot learning largely relies on annotated data for meta-learning: base classes sampled from the same domain as the novel classes. However, in many applications, collecting data for meta-learning is infeasible or impossible. This leads to the cross-domain few-shot learning problem, where there is a large shift between base and novel class domains. While investigations of the cross-domain few-shot scenario exist, these works are limited to natural images that still contain a high degree of visual similarity. No work yet exists that examines few-shot learning across different imaging methods seen in real world scenarios, such as aerial and medical imaging. In this paper, we propose the Broader Study of Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (BSCD-FSL) benchmark, consisting of image data from a diverse assortment of image acquisition methods. This includes natural images, such as crop disease images, but additionally those that present with an increasing dissimilarity to natural images, such as satellite images, dermatology images, and radiology images. Extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark are performed to evaluate state-of-art meta-learning approaches, transfer learning approaches, and newer methods for cross-domain few-shot learning. The results demonstrate that state-of-art meta-learning methods are surprisingly outperformed by earlier meta-learning approaches, and all meta-learning methods underperform in relation to simple fine-tuning by 12.8% average accuracy. In some cases, meta-learning even underperforms networks with random weights. Performance gains previously observed with methods specialized for cross-domain few-shot learning vanish in this more challenging benchmark. Finally, accuracy of all methods tend to correlate with dataset similarity to natural images, verifying the value of the benchmark to better represent the diversity of data seen in practice and guiding future research. Code for all experiments in this work will be made available on GitHub.\"",

This skill is essential to solving the visual problems featured in the RAVEN and PGM datasets, yet, previous papers have scarcely tested how well models generalise across tasks. Additionally, we encounter a critical issue that allows existing models to inadvertently 'cheat' problems in RAVEN. We therefore propose a simple workaround to resolve this issue, and focus the conversation on generalisation performance, as this was severely affected in the process. We revise the existing evaluation, and introduce two relational models, Rel-Base and Rel-AIR, that significantly improve this performance. To our knowledge, Rel-AIR is the first method to employ unsupervised scene decomposition in solving abstract visual reasoning problems, and along with Rel-Base, sets states-of-the-art for image-only reasoning and generalisation across both RAVEN and PGM.\"",

        "abstract": "Recent advances of network architecture for point cloud processing are mainly driven by new designs of local aggregation operators. However, the impact of these operators to network performance is not carefully investigated due to different overall network architecture and implementation details in each solution. Meanwhile, most of operators are only applied in shallow architectures. In this paper, we revisit the representative local aggregation operators and study their performance using the same deep residual architecture. Our investigation reveals that depsite the different designs of these operators, all of these operators make surprisingly similar contributions to the network performance under the same network input and feature numbers and result in the state-of-the-art accuracy on standard benchmarks. This finding stimulate us to rethink the necessity of sophisticated design of local aggregation operator for point cloud processing. To this end, we propose a simple local aggregation operator without learnable weights, named Position Pooling (PosPool), which performs similarly or slightly better than existing sophisticated operators. In particular, a simple deep residual network with PosPool layers exhibits outstanding performance on all benchmarks, which outperforms the previous state-of-the methods on the challenging PartNet datasets by a large margin (6.4 mIoU). \"",

One limitation of the vanilla graph convolution is that it models the relationships between neighboring nodes via a shared weight matrix. This is suboptimal for articulated body modeling as the relations between different body joints are different. The objective of this paper is to have a comprehensive and systematic study of weight sharing in GCNs for 3D HPE. We first show there are two different ways to interpret a GCN depending on whether feature transformation occurs before or after feature aggregation. These two interpretations lead to five different weight sharing methods, and three more variants can be derived by decoupling the self-connections with other edges. We conduct extensive ablation study on these weight sharing methods under controlled settings and obtain new conclusions that will benefit the community.\"",

Each regional minimum is computed with a sequential quadratic programming scheme. These premises result in an algorithm that always determines the global minima of the perspective-n-point problem for any number of input correspondences, regardless of possible coplanar arrangements of the imaged 3D points.

Addressing this, we introduce the novel task FurnMove in which agents work together to move a piece of furniture through a living room to a goal. Unlike existing tasks, FurnMove requires agents to coordinate at every timestep. We identify two challenges when training agents to complete FurnMove: existing decentralized action sampling procedures do not permit expressive joint action policies and, in tasks requiring close coordination, the number of failed actions dominates successful actions. To confront these challenges we introduce SYNC-policies (synchronize your actions coherently) and CORDIAL (coordination loss). Using SYNC-policies and CORDIAL, our agents achieve a 58% completion rate on FurnMove, an impressive absolute gain of 25 percentage points over competitive decentralized baselines.

However, existing learning based burst denoising methods are limited by two factors. On one hand, most of the models are trained on video sequences with synthetic noise. When applied to real-world raw image sequences, visual artifacts often appear due to the different noise statistics. On the other hand, there lacks a real-world burst denoising benchmark of dynamic scenes because the generation of clean ground-truth is very difficult due to the presence of object motions. In this paper, a novel multi-frame CNN model is carefully designed, which decouples the learning of motion from the learning of noise statistics. Consequently, an alternating learning algorithm is developed to learn how to align adjacent frames from a synthetic noisy video dataset, and learn to adapt to the raw noise statistics from real-world noisy datasets of static scenes. Finally, the trained model can be applied to real-world dynamic sequences for burst denoising. Extensive experiments on both synthetic video datasets and real-world dynamic sequences demonstrate the leading burst denoising performance of our proposed method.\"",

        "abstract": "Video frame interpolation (VFI) aims at synthesizing new video frames in-between existing frames to generate smoother high frame rate videos. Current methods usually use the fixed pre-trained networks to generate interpolated-frames for different resolutions and scenes. However, the fixed pre-trained networks are difficult to be tailored for a variety of cases. Inspired by classical pyramid energy minimization optical flow algorithms, this paper proposes a recurrent residual pyramid network (RRPN) for video frame interpolation. In the proposed network, different pyramid levels share the same weights and base-network, named recurrent residual layer (RRL). In RRL, residual displacements between warped images are detected to gradually refine optical flows rather than directly predict the flows or frames. Owing to the flexible recurrent residual pyramid architecture, we can customize the number of pyramid levels, and make trade-offs between calculations and quality based on the application scenarios. Moreover, occlusion masks are also generated in this recurrent residual way to solve occlusion better. Finally, a refinement network is added to enhance the details for final output with contextual and edge information. Experimental results demonstrate that the RRPN is more flexible and efficient than current VFI networks but has fewer parameters. In particular, the RRPN, which avoid over-reliance on datasets and network structures, shows superior performance for large motion cases.\"",

We demonstrate that GHT subsumes three classic thresholding techniques as special cases: Otsu's method, Minimum Error Thresholding (MET), and weighted percentile thresholding. GHT thereby enables the continuous interpolation between those three algorithms, which allows thresholding accuracy to be improved significantly. GHT also provides a clarifying interpretation of the common practice of coarsening a histogram's bin width during thresholding. We show that GHT outperforms or matches the performance of all algorithms on a recent challenge for handwritten document image binarization (including deep neural networks trained to produce per-pixel binarizations), and can be implemented in a dozen lines of code or as a trivial modification to Otsu's method or MET.\"",

Specifically, different from existing graph-based schemes, GATES models the operations as the transformation of the propagating information, which mimics the actual data processing of neural architecture. GATES is a more reasonable modeling of the neural architectures, and can encode architectures from both the \"\"operation on node\"\" and \"\"operation on edge\"\" cell search spaces consistently. Experimental results on various search spaces confirm GATES's effectiveness in improving the performance predictor. Furthermore, equipped with the improved performance predictor, the sample efficiency of the predictor-based neural architecture search (NAS) flow is boosted.\"",

        "abstract": "Radon transform is a popular mathematical tool for shape analysis. However, it cannot handle affine deformation. Although its extended version, trace transform, allow us to construct affine invariants, they are less informative and computational expensive due to the loss of spatial relationship between trace lines and the extensive repeated calculation of transform. To address this issue, a novel line integral transform is proposed. We first use binding line pairs that have the desirable property of affine preserving as a reference frame to rewrite the diametrical dimension parameters of the lines in a relative manner which make them independent on affine transform. Along polar angle dimension of the line parameters, a moment-based normalization is then conducted to degrade the affine transform to similarity transform which can be easily normalized by Fourier transform. The proposed transform is not only invariant to affine transform, but also preserves the spatial relationship between line integrals which make it very informative. Another advantage of the proposed transform is that it is more efficient than the trace transform. Conducting it one time can allow us to achieve a 2D matrix of affine invariants. While conducting the trace transform once only generates a single feature and multiple trace transforms of different functionals are needed to derive more to make the descriptors informative. The effectiveness of the proposed transform has been validated on two types of standard shape test cases, affinely distorted contour shape dataset and region shape dataset, respectively.\"",

Given an input video of an actor performing some action, we aim to synthesize a video with the same action performed from a novel view with the help of an appearance prior. We propose an end-to-end deep network to solve this problem. The proposed network utilizes the change in viewpoint to transform the action from the input view to the novel view in feature space. The transformed action is integrated with the target appearance using the proposed recurrent transformer network, which provides a transformed appearance for each time-step in the action sequence. The recurrent transformer network utilize action key-points which are determined in an unsupervised approach using the encoded action features. We also propose a hierarchical structure for the recurrent transformation which further improves the performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments conducted on a large-scale multi-view action recognition NTU-RGB+D dataset. In addition, we show that the proposed method can transform the action to a novel viewpoint with an entirely different scene or actor.

It identifies the most critical issue in this problem---imbalanced data pairs. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple and effective framework to sample pairs in a batch of data for updating the model. The key to this framework is to define a robust loss for all pairs over a mini-batch of data, which is formulated by distributionally robust optimization. The flexibility in constructing the {\\it uncertainty decision set} of the dual variable allows us to recover state-of-the-art complicated losses and also to induce novel variants.

In this work, we design a single stream network to directly use the depth map to guide early fusion and middle fusion between RGB and depth, which saves the feature encoder of the depth stream and achieves a lightweight and real-time model. We tactfully utilize depth information from two perspectives: (1) Overcoming the incompatibility problem caused by the great difference between modalities, we build a single stream encoder to achieve the early fusion, which can take full advantage of ImageNet pre-trained backbone model to extract rich and discriminative features. (2) We design a novel depth-enhanced dual attention module (DEDA) to efficiently provide the fore-/back-ground branches with the spatially filtered features, which enables the decoder to optimally perform the middle fusion. Besides, we put forward a pyramidally attended feature extraction module (PAFE) to accurately localize the objects of different scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model performs favorably against most state-of-the-art methods under different evaluation metrics.

To address these issues, we propose a learning framework Subject Guidance Network (SGNet) for shot type recognition. SGNet separates the subject and background of a shot into two streams, serving as maps to guide scale and movement type classification respectively.

        "abstract": "Recently, substantial research efforts in Deep Metric Learning (DML) focused on designing complex pairwise-distance losses, which require convoluted schemes to ease optimization, such as sample mining or pair weighting. The standard cross-entropy loss for classification has been largely overlooked in DML. On the surface, the cross-entropy may seem unrelated and irrelevant to metric learning as it does not explicitly involve pairwise distances. However, we provide a theoretical analysis that links the cross-entropy to several well-known and recent pairwise losses. Our connections are drawn from two different perspectives: one based on an explicit optimization insight; the other on discriminative and generative views of the mutual information between the labels and the learned features. First, we explicitly demonstrate that the cross-entropy is an upper bound on a new pairwise loss, which has a structure similar to various pairwise losses: it minimizes intra-class distances while maximizing inter-class distances. As a result, minimizing the cross-entropy can be seen as an approximate bound-optimization (or Majorize-Minimize) algorithm for minimizing this pairwise loss. Second, we show that, more generally,minimizing the cross-entropy is actually equivalent to maximizing the mutual information, to which we connect several well-known pairwise losses. Furthermore, we show that various standard pairwise losses can be explicitly related to one another via bound relationships. Our findings indicate that the cross-entropy represents a proxy for maximizing the mutual information \u2013 as pairwise losses do \u2013 without the need for convoluted sample-mining heuristics. Our experiments\u2020over four standard DML benchmarks strongly support our findings. We obtain state-of-the-art results, outperforming recent and complex DML methods.\"",

Anchor boxes are densely proposed over the images and the network is trained to predict the boxes position offset as well as the classification confidence. Existing systems pre-define anchor box shapes and sizes and ad-hoc heuristic adjustments are used to define the anchor configurations. However, this might be sub-optimal or even wrong when a new dataset or a new model is adopted. In this paper, we study the problem of automatically optimizing anchor boxes for object detection. We first demonstrate that the number of anchors, anchor scales and ratios are crucial factors for a reliable object detection system. By carefully analyzing the existing bounding box patterns on the feature hierarchy, we design a flexible and tight hyper-parameter space for anchor configurations. Then we propose a novel hyper-parameter optimization method named AABO to determine more appropriate anchor boxes for a certain dataset, in which Bayesian Optimization and subsampling method are combined to achieve precise and efficient anchor configuration optimization. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on different detectors and datasets, e.g. achieving around 2.4% mAP improvement on COCO, 1.6% on ADE and 1.5% on VG, and the optimal anchors can bring 1.4% \u223c 2.4% mAP improvement on SOTA detectors by only optimizing anchor configurations, e.g. boosting Mask RCNN from 40.3% to 42.3%, and HTC detector from 46.8% to 48.2%.\"",

        "abstract": "Scene text spotting aims to detect and recognize the entire word or sentence with multiple characters in natural images. It is still challenging because ambiguity often occurs when the spacing between characters is large or the characters are evenly spread in multiple rows and columns, making many visually plausible groupings of the characters (e.g. \"\"BERLIN\"\" is incorrectly detected as \"\"BERL\"\" and \"\"IN\"\" in Fig. 1(c)). Unlike previous works that merely employed visual features for text detection, this work proposes a novel text spotter, named Ambiguity Eliminating Text Spotter (AE TextSpotter), which learns both visual and linguistic features to significantly reduce ambiguity in text detection. The proposed AE TextSpotter has three important benefits. 1) A carefully designed language module is utilized to reduce the detection confidence of incorrect text lines, making them easily pruned in the detection stage. 2) The linguistic representation is learned together with the visual representation in a framework. To our knowledge, it is the first time to improve text detection by using a language model. 3) Extensive experiments show that AE TextSpotter outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. For example, we carefully select a set of extremely ambiguous samples from the IC19-ReCTS dataset, where our approach surpasses other methods by more than 4%.\"",

The problems of GANs come from approximating the intrinsic discontinuous distribution transform map with continuous DNNs. The recently proposed AE-OT model addresses the discontinuity problem by explicitly computing the discontinuous optimal transform map in the latent space of the autoencoder. Though have no mode collapse/mixture, the generated images by AE-OT are blurry. In this paper, we propose the AE-OT-GAN model to utilize the advantages of the both models: generate high quality images and at the same time overcome the mode collapse/mixture problems. Specifically, we firstly embed the low dimensional image manifold into the latent space by training an autoencoder (AE). Then the extended semi-discrete optimal transport (SDOT) map from the uniform distribution to the empirical latent distribution is used to generate new latent codes. Finally, our GAN model is trained to generate high quality images from the latent distribution induced by the extended SDOT map. The distribution transform map from this dataset related latent distribution to the data distribution will be continuous, and thus can be well approximated by the continuous DNNs. Additionally, the paired data between the latent codes and the real images gives us further restriction about the genera-tor and stabilizes the training process. Experiments on simple MNIST dataset and complex datasets like CIFAR10 and CelebA show the advantages of the proposed method.\"",

        "abstract": "Guided refinement is a popular procedure of various image post-processing applications. It produces output image based on input and guided images. Input images are usually flawed estimates containing kinds of noises and outliers, which undermine the edge consistency between input and guided images. As improvements, they are refined into output images with similar intensities of input images and consistent edges of guided images. However, outliers are usually untraceable and simply treated as zero-mean noises, limiting the quality of such refinement. In this paper, we propose a general outlier detection method for guided refinement. We assume local linear relationship between output and guided images to express the expected edge consistency, based on which, the outlier likelihoods of input pixels are measured. The metric is termed as ALRe (anchored linear residual) since it is essentially the residual of local linear regression with an equality constraint exerted on the measured pixel. Valuable features of the ALRe are discussed. Its effectiveness is proven by applications and experiment.\"",

In this work, we propose an innovative adversarial-based mutual learning network (AMLN) that introduces process-driven learning beyond outcome-driven learning for augmented online knowledge distillation. A block-wise training module is designed which guides the information flow and mutual learning among peer networks adversarially throughout different learning stages, and this spreads until the final network layer which captures more high-level information.

As for the robust classification problem, a generative classifier typically models the distribution of inputs and labels, and thus can better handle off-manifold examples at the cost of a concise structure. On the contrary, a discriminative classifier only models the conditional distribution of labels given inputs, but benefits from effective optimization owing to its succinct structure. This work aims for a solution of generative classifiers that can profit from the merits of both. To this end, we propose an Anti-Perturbation Inference (API) method, which searches for anti-perturbations to maximize the lower bound of the joint log-likelihood of inputs and classes. By leveraging the lower bound to approximate Bayes' rule, we construct a generative classifier Anti-Perturbation Inference Net (API-Net) upon a single discriminator. It takes advantage of the generative properties to tackle off-manifold examples while maintaining a succinct structure for effective optimization. Experiments show that API successfully neutralizes adversarial perturbations, and API-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on prevailing benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, MNIST, and SVHN. \"",

The patches target several object categories for three COCO-trained detection models, and the photos represent natural variation in position, distance, lighting conditions, and viewing angle. Our analysis suggests that maintaining adversarial robustness in uncontrolled settings is highly challenging, but it is still possible to produce targeted detections under white-box and sometimes black-box settings. We establish baselines for defending against adversarial patches through several methods, including a detector supervised with synthetic data and unsupervised methods such as kernel density estimation, Bayesian uncertainty, and reconstruction error. Our results suggest that adversarial patches can be effectively flagged, both in a high-knowledge, attack-specific scenario, and in an unsupervised setting where patches are detected as anomalies in natural images. This dataset and the described experiments provide a benchmark for future research on the effectiveness of and defenses against physical adversarial objects in the wild.\"",

However, it remains challenging when extending to classification tasks with millions of classes. Previous studies are focused on solving this problem in a distributed fashion or using a sampling-based approach to reduce the computational cost caused by the softmax layer.However, these approaches still need high GPU memory in order to work with large models and it is non-trivial to extend them to parallel settings.To address these issues, we propose an efficient training framework to handle extreme classification tasks based onRandom Projection. The key idea is that we first train a slimmed model with a random projected softmax classifier and then we recover it to the original version. We also show a theoretical guarantee that this recovered classifier can approximate the original classifier with a small error. Later, we extend our framework to parallel scenarios by adopting a communication reduction technique. In our experiment, we demonstrate that the proposed frame-work is able to train deep learning models with millions of classes and achieve above 10\u00d7speedup compared to existing approaches.\"",

To overcome such problems, some research works have suggested to use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). But acquiring large scale dataset with polarization information is a very difficult task. If there is an accurate model which can describe a complicated phenomenon of polarization, we can easily produce synthetic polarized images with various situations to train CNN. In this paper, we propose a new polarimetric BRDF (pBRDF) model. We prove its accuracy by fitting our model to measured data with variety of light and camera conditions. We render polarized images using this model and use them to estimate surface normal. Experiments show that the CNN trained by our polarized images has more accuracy than one trained by RGB only.\"",

However, there are still two limitations. One hand is that the pooling and upsampling operations in FCNs might cause blur object boundaries. On the other hand, using an additional depth-network to extract depth features might lead to high computation and storage cost. The reliance on depth inputs during testing also limits the practical applications of current RGB-D models. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative learning framework where edge, depth and saliency are leveraged in a more efficient way, which solves those problems tactfully. The explicitly extracted edge information goes together with saliency to give more emphasis to the salient regions and object boundaries. Depth and saliency learning is innovatively integrated into the high-level feature learning process in a mutual-benefit manner. This strategy enables the network to be free of using extra depth networks and depth inputs to make inference. To this end, it makes our model more lightweight, faster and more versatile. Experiment results on seven benchmark datasets show its superior performance.\"",

This article provides new formulations for achieving epipolar geometry-consistent ACs, that, besides leading to linear solvers that are up to 30$ imes$ faster than the state-of-the-art alternatives, allow for a fast refinement scheme that significantly improves the quality of the noisy ACs. In addition, a tracker that automatically enforces the epipolar geometry is proposed, with experiments showing that it significantly outperforms competing methods in situations of low texture. This opens the way to application domains where the scenes are typically low textured, such as during arthroscopic procedures.\"",

In this study, however, we assume that the target scene may change over time, and propose a method for acquiring a dynamic light field (a moving scene) using a coded aperture camera and a convolutional neural network (CNN). To successfully handle scene motions, we develop a new configuration of image observation, called V-shape observation, and train the CNN using a dynamic-light-field dataset with pseudo motions.

        "abstract": "When a very fast dynamic event is recorded with a low-framerate camera, the resulting video suffers from severe motion blur (due to exposure time) and motion aliasing (due to low sampling rate in time). True Temporal Super-Resolution (TSR) is more than just Temporal-Interpolation (increasing framerate). It can also recover new high temporal frequencies beyond the temporal Nyquist limit of the input video, thus resolving both motion-blur and motion aliasing \u2013 effects that temporal frame interpolation (as sophisticated as it may be) cannot undo. In this paper we propose a \u201cDeep Internal Learning\u201d approach for true TSR. We train a video-specific FCN on examples extracted directly from the low-framerate input video. Our method exploits the strong recurrence of small space-time patches inside a single video sequence, both within and across different spatio-temporal scales of the video.We further observe (for the first time) that small space-time patches recur also across-dimensions of the video sequence \u2013 i.e., by swapping the spatial and temporal dimensions. In particular, the higher spatial resolution of video frames provides strong examples as to how to increase the temporal resolution of that video. Such internal video-specific examples give rise to strong self-supervision, requiring no data but the input video itself. This results in Zero-Shot Temporal-SR of complex videos, which removes both motion blur and motion aliasing, outperforming previous supervised methods trained on external video datasets.\"",

        "abstract": "The problem of action localization involves locating the action in the video, both over time and spatially in the image. The current dominant approaches use supervised learning to solve this problem. They require large amounts of annotated training data, in the form of frame-level bounding box annotations around the region of interest. In this paper, we present a new approach based on continual learning that uses feature-level predictions for self-supervision. It does not require any training annotations in terms of frame-level bounding boxes. The approach is inspired by cognitive models of visual event perception that propose a prediction-based approach to event understanding. We use a stack of LSTMs coupled with a CNN encoder, along with novel attention mechanisms, to model the events in the video and use this model to predict high-level features for the future frames. The prediction errors are used to learn the parameters of the models continuously. This self-supervised framework is not complicated as other approaches but is very effective in learning robust visual representations for both labeling and localization. It should be noted that the approach outputs in a streaming fashion, requiring only a single pass through the video, making it amenable for real-time processing. We demonstrate this on three datasets - UCF Sports, JHMDB, and THUMOS'13 and show that the proposed approach outperforms weakly-supervised and unsupervised baselines and obtains competitive performance compared to fully supervised baselines. Finally, we show that the proposed framework can generalize to egocentric videos and achieve state-of-the-art results on the unsupervised gaze prediction task.

In this paper, we present a conceptually simple, computationally efficient, and more precise action tubelet detection framework, termed as MovingCenter Detector (MOC-detector), by treating an action instance as a trajectory of moving points. Based on the insight that movement information could simplify and assist action tubelet detection, our MOC-detector is composed of three crucial head branches: (1) Center Branch for instance center detection and action recognition, (2) Movement Branch for movement estimation at adjacent frames to form trajectories of moving points, (3) Box Branch for spatial extent detection by directly regressing bounding box size at each estimated center. These three branches work together to generate the tubelet detection results, which could be further linked to yield video-level tubes with a matching strategy. Our MOC-detector outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods for both metrics of frame-mAP and video-mAP on the JHMDB and UCF101-24 datasets. The performance gap is more evident for higher video IoU, demonstrating that our MOC-detector is particularly effective for more precise action detection.

Annotating head centers is however a laborious and tedious process in dense crowds. In this paper, we present an active learning framework which enables accurate crowd counting with limited supervision: given a small labeling budget, instead of randomly selecting images to annotate, we first introduce an active labeling strategy to annotate the most informative images in the dataset and learn the counting model upon them. The process is repeated such that in every cycle we select the samples that are diverse in crowd density and dissimilar to previous selections. In the last cycle when the labeling budget is met, the large amount of unlabeled data are also utilized: a distribution classifier is introduced to align the labeled data with unlabeled data; furthermore, we propose to mix up the distribution labels and latent representations of data in the network to particularly improve the distribution alignment in-between training samples. We follow the popular density estimation pipeline for crowd counting. Extensive experiments are conducted on standard benchmarks i.e. ShanghaiTech, UCF CC 50, MAll, TRANCOS, and DCC. By annotating limited number of images (e.g. 10% of the dataset), our method reaches levels of performance not far from the state of the art which utilize full annotations of the dataset.\"",

One of the key challenges in VLN is how to conduct a robust navigation by mitigating the uncertainty caused by ambiguous instructions and insufficient observation of the environment. Agents trained by current approaches typically suffer from this and would consequently struggle to avoid random and inefficient actions at every step. In contrast, when humans face such a challenge, they can still maintain robust navigation by actively exploring the surroundings to gather more information and thus make more confident navigation decisions. This work draws inspiration from human navigation behavior and endows an agent with an active information gathering ability for a more intelligent vision-language navigation policy. To achieve this, we propose an end-to-end framework for learning an exploration policy that decides i) when and where to explore, ii) what information is worth gathering during exploration, and extbf{iii)} how to adjust the navigation decision after the exploration. The experimental results show promising exploration strategies emerged from training, which leads to significant boost in navigation performance.

In this work, we present the Conditional Domain Normalization (CDN) to bridge the domain distribution gap.

To achieve this, we first disentangle the domain-specific attribute out of the semantic features from source domain via a domain embedding module, which learns a domain-vector to characterize the domain attribute information. Then this domain-vector is used to encode the features from target domain through a conditional normalization, resulting in different domains' features carrying the same domain attribute. We incorporate CDN into various convolution stages of an object detector to adaptively address the domain shifts of different level's representation. In contrast to existing adaptation works that conduct domain confusion learning on semantic features to remove domain-specific factors, CDN aligns different domain distributions by modulating the semantic features of target domains conditioned on the learned domain-vector of the source domain. Extensive experiments show that CDN outperforms existing methods remarkably on both real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation benchmarks, including 2D image detection and 3D point cloud detection.\"",

In this paper, we investigate the problem of reducing the overall computation cost yet maintaining the high accuracy for 3D hand pose estimation from video sequences. A novel model, called Adaptive Computationally Efficient (ACE) network, is proposed, which takes advantage of a Gaussian kernel based Gate Module to dynamically switch the computation between a light model and a heavy network for feature extraction. Our model employs the light model to compute efficient features for most of the frames and invokes the heavy model only when necessary. Combined with the temporal context, the proposed model accurately estimates the 3D hand pose. We evaluate our model on two publicly available datasets, and achieve state-of-the-art performance at only 22% of the computation cost compared to the ordinary temporal models.\"",

        "abstract": "Data from new categories are continuously being discovered, which has sparked significant amount of research in developing approaches which generalizes to previously unseen categories, i.e. zero-shot setting. Zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval~(ZS-SBIR) is one such problem in the context of cross-domain retrieval, which has received lot of attention due to its various real-life applications. Since most real-world training data have a fair amount of imbalance; in this work, for the first time in literature, we extensively study the effect of training data imbalance on the generalization to unseen categories, with ZS-SBIR as the application area. We evaluate several state-of-the-art data imbalance mitigating techniques and analyze their results. Furthermore, we propose a novel framework AMDReg (Adaptive Margin Diversity Regularizer), which ensures that the embeddings of the sketch and images in the latent space are not only semantically meaningful, but they also are separated according to their class-representations in the training set. The proposed approach is model-independent, and it can be incorporated seamlessly with several state-of-the-art ZS-SBIR methods to improve their performance under imbalanced condition. Extensive experiments and analysis justifies the effectiveness of the proposed AMDReg for mitigating the effect of data imbalance for generalization to unseen classes in ZS-SBIR.\"",

Existing methods widely adopt density maps as the training targets to optimize the point-to-point loss. While in testing phase, we only focus on the differences between the crowd numbers and the global summation of density maps, which indicate the inconsistency between the training targets and the evaluation criteria. To solve this problem, we introduce a new target, named local counting map (LCM), to obtain more accurate results than density map based approaches. Moreover, we also propose an adaptive mixture regression framework with three modules in a coarse-to-fine manner to further improve the precision of the crowd estimation: scale-aware module (SAM), mixture regression module (MRM) and adaptive soft interval module (ASIM). Specifically, SAM fully utilizes the context and multi-scale information from different convolutional features; MRM and ASIM perform more precise counting regression on local patches of images. Compared with current methods, the proposed method reports better performances on the typical datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/xiyang1012/Local-Crowd-Counting .\"",

        "abstract": "Existing image-text matching approaches typically leverage triplet loss with online hard negatives to train the model. For each image or text anchor in a training mini-batch, the model is trained to distinguish between a positive and the most confusing negative of the anchor mined from the mini-batch (i.e. online hard negative). This strategy improves the model's capacity to discover fine-grained correspondences and non-correspondences between image and text inputs. However, the above approach has the following drawbacks: (1) the negative selection strategy still provides limited chances for the model to learn from very hard-to-distinguish cases. (2) The trained model has weak generalization capability from the training set to the testing set. (3) The penalty lacks hierarchy and adaptiveness for hard negatives with different ``hardness'' degrees. In this paper, we propose solutions by sampling negatives offline from the whole training set. It provides ``harder'' offline negatives than online hard negatives for the model to distinguish. Based on the offline hard negatives, a quintuplet loss is proposed to improve the model's generalization capability to distinguish positives and negatives. In addition, a novel loss function that combines the knowledge of positives, offline hard negatives and online hard negatives is created. It leverages offline hard negatives as the intermediary to adaptively penalize them based on their distance relations to the anchor. We evaluate the proposed training approach on three state-of-the-art image-text models on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets. Significant performance improvements are observed for all the models, proving the effectiveness and generality of our approach. Code is available at https://github.com/sunnychencool/AOQ.\"",

The key idea of meta-learning for few-shot classification is to mimic the few-shot situations faced at test time by randomly sampling classes in meta-training data to construct few-shot tasks for episodic training. While a rich line of work focuses solely on how to extract meta-knowledge across tasks, we exploit the complementary problem on how to generate informative tasks. We argue that the randomly sampled tasks could be sub-optimal and uninformative (e.g., the task of classifying ``dog\"\" from ``laptop\"\" is often trivial) to the meta-learner. In this paper, we propose an adaptive task sampling method to improve the generalization performance. Unlike instance based sampling, task based sampling is much more challenging due to the implicit definition of the task in each episode. Therefore, we accordingly propose a greedy class-pair based sampling method, which selects difficult tasks according to class-pair potentials. We evaluate our adaptive task sampling method on two few-shot classification benchmarks, and it achieves consistent improvements across different feature backbones, meta-learning algorithms and datasets.\"",

        "abstract": "Estimating age from a single facial image is a classic and challenging topic in computer vision. One of its most intractable issues is label ambiguity, i.e., face images from adjacent age of the same person are often indistinguishable. Some existing methods adopt distribution learning to tackle this issue by exploiting the semantic correlation between age labels. Actually, most of them set a fixed value to the variance of Gaussian label distribution for all the images. However, the variance is closely related to the correlation between adjacent ages and should vary across ages and identities. To model a sample-specific variance, in this paper, we propose an adaptive variance based distribution learning (AVDL) method for facial age estimation. AVDL introduces the data-driven optimization framework, meta-learning, to achieve this. Specifically, AVDL performs a meta gradient descent step on the variable (i.e. variance) to minimize the loss on a clean unbiased validation set. By adaptively learning proper variance for each sample, our method can approximate the true age probability distribution more effectively. Extensive experiments on FG-NET and MORPH II datasets show the superiority of our proposed approach to the existing state-of-the-art methods.\"",

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework that learns to adapt highlight detection to a user by exploiting the user's history in the form of highlights that the user has previously created. Our framework consists of two sub-networks: a fully temporal convolutional highlight detection network $H$ that predicts highlight for an input video and a history encoder network $M$ for user history. We introduce a newly designed temporal-adaptive instance normalization (T-AIN) layer to $H$ where the two sub-networks interact with each other. T-AIN has affine parameters that are predicted from $M$ based on the user history and is responsible for the user-adaptive signal to $H$. Extensive experiments on a large-scale dataset show that our framework can make more accurate and user-specific highlight predictions.\"",

We aim to address the following problems in current 3D point cloud adversarial attacks: they do not transfer well between different networks, and they are easy to defend against via simple statistical methods. To this extent, we develop a new point cloud attack (dubbed AdvPC) that exploits the input data distribution by adding an adversarial loss, after Auto-Encoder reconstruction, to the objective it optimizes. AdvPC leads to perturbations that are resilient against current defenses, while remaining highly transferable compared to state-of-the-art attacks. We test AdvPC using four popular point cloud networks: PointNet, PointNet++ (MSG and SSG), and DGCNN. Our proposed attack increases the attack success rate by up to 40% for those transferred to unseen networks (transferability), while maintaining a high success rate on the attacked network. AdvPC also increases the ability to break defenses by up to 38% as compared to other baselines on the ModelNet40 dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/ajhamdi/AdvPC .\"",

To further improve the performance, we build our network using two parallel branches which operate in an adversarial way: the first branch localizes the most salient activities of a video and the second one finds other supplementary activities from non-localized parts of the video. Extensive experiments performed on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is effective.

However, training these models frequently requires large labeled image sets whose creation is often very time and labor intensive, for example, in the context of 3D segmentations. Approaches capable of training deep segmentation networks with a limited number of labeled samples are therefore highly desirable. Data augmentation or semi-supervised approaches are commonly used to cope with limited labeled training data. However, the augmentation strategies for many existing approaches are either hand-engineered or require computationally demanding searches. To that end, we explore an augmentation strategy which builds statistical deformation models from unlabeled data via principal component analysis and uses the resulting statistical deformation space to augment the labeled training samples. Specifically, we obtain transformations via deep registration models. This allows for an intuitive control over plausible deformation magnitudes via the statistical model and, if combined with an appropriate deformation model, yields spatially regular transformations. To optimally augment a dataset we use an adversarial strategy integrated into our statistical deformation model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for the segmentation of knee cartilage from 3D magnetic resonance images. We show favorable performance to state-of-the-art augmentation approaches.\"",

The objective is to learn a model that explicitly captures temporal dependencies, providing a capability to forecast multiple, distinct future activities. Our adversarial grammar is designed so that it can learn stochastic production rules from the data distribution, jointly with its latent non-terminal representations. Being able to select multiple production rules during inference leads to different predicted outcomes, thus efficiently modeling many plausible futures.",

With the hypothesis that the shift between a given pair of domains is shared across tasks, we propose a new method for ZSDA by transferring domain shift from an irrelevant task (IrT) to the task of interest (ToI). Specifically, we first identify an IrT, where dual-domain samples are available, and capture the domain shift with a coupled generative adversarial networks (CoGAN) in this task. Then, we train a CoGAN for the ToI and restrict it to carry the same domain shift as the CoGAN for IrT does. In addition, we introduce a pair of co-training classifiers to regularize the training procedure of CoGAN in the ToI. The proposed method not only derives machine learning models for the non-available target-domain data, but also synthesizes the data themselves. We evaluate the proposed method on benchmark datasets and achieve the state-of-the-art performances. \"",

However, the vulnerability of DNN-based image ranking systems remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose two attacks against deep ranking systems, i.e., Candidate Attack and Query Attack, that can raise or lower the rank of chosen candidates by adversarial perturbations. Specifically, the expected ranking order is first represented as a set of inequalities, and then a triplet-like objective function is designed to obtain the optimal perturbation. Conversely, a defense method is also proposed to improve the ranking system robustness, which can mitigate all the proposed attacks simultaneously. Our adversarial ranking attacks and defense are evaluated on datasets including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Stanford-Online-Products. Experimental results demonstrate that a typical DNN-based ranking system can be effectively compromised by our attacks. Meanwhile, the system robustness can be moderately improved with our defense. Furthermore, the transferable and universal properties of our adversary illustrate the possibility of realistic black-box attack.\"",

Its major challenge lies in how to effectively learn motion representations from unlabeled data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been proved very effective at learning representations from unlabeled data in the image domain. However, few effective self-supervised approaches exist for 3D action recognition, and directly applying SSL for semi-supervised learning suffers from misalignment of representations learned from SSL and supervised learning tasks. To address these issues, we present Adversarial Self-Supervised Learning (ASSL), a novel framework that tightly couples SSL and the semi-supervised scheme via neighbor relation exploration and adversarial learning. Specifically, we design an effective SSL scheme to improve the discrimination capability of learned representations for 3D action recognition, through exploring the data relations within a neighborhood. We further propose an adversarial regularization to align the feature distributions of labeled and unlabeled samples. To demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed ASSL in semi-supervised 3D action recognition, we conduct extensive experiments on NTU and N-UCLA datasets. The results confirm its advantageous performance over state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods in the few label regime for 3D action recognition.\"",

The state-of-the-art methods suffer from insufficient examples of challenging cases such as symmetric appearance, heavy occlusion and nearby person.

We instead propose Semantic Data Augmentation (SDA), a method that augments images by pasting segmented body parts with various semantic granularity. Furthermore, we propose Adversarial Semantic Data Augmentation (ASDA), which exploits a generative network to dynamiclly predict tailored pasting configuration. Given off-the-shelf pose estimation network as discriminator, the generator seeks the most confusing transformation to increase the loss of the discriminator while the discriminator takes the generated sample as input and learns from it.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that models the effect of deformation for designing physical adversarial examples with respect to non-rigid objects such as T-shirts. We show that the proposed method achieves 74% and 57% attack success rates in the digital and physical worlds respectively against YOLOv2. In contrast, the state-of-the-art physical attack method to fool a person detector only achieves 18% attack success rate. Furthermore, by leveraging min-max optimization, we extend our method to the ensemble attack setting against two object detectors YOLO-v2 and Faster R-CNN simultaneously.\"",

Practically, adversarial training is by far the most effective approach for enhancing the robustness of neural networks against adversarial examples. The current adversarial training approach aims to maximize the posterior probability for adversarially perturbed training data. However, such a training strategy ignores the fact that the clean data and adversarial examples should have intrinsically different feature distributions despite that they are assigned with the same class label under adversarial training. We propose that this problem can be solved by explicitly modeling the deep feature distribution, for example as a Gaussian Mixture, and then properly introducing the likelihood regularization into the loss function. Specifically, by maximizing the likelihood of features of clean data and minimizing that of adversarial examples simultaneously, the neural network learns a more reasonable feature distribution in which the intrinsic difference between clean data and adversarial examples can be explicitly preserved. We call such a new robust training strategy the adversarial training with bi-directional likelihood regularization (ATBLR) method. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that the ATBLR method facilitates robust classification of both clean data and adversarial examples, and performs favorably against previous state-of-the-art methods for robust visual classification.\"",

Furthermore, we propose a supervision method to jointly and progressively optimize attention, reasoning, and task performance so that models learn to look at regions of interests by following a reasoning process.

First, we introduce an encoding mechanism for representing the fine-grained spatial layout of the human and object (a subtle cue) and also semantic context (a cue, represented by text embeddings of surrounding objects). Second, we use plausible future movements of humans and objects as a cue to constrain the space of possible interactions.

However, existing methods for action assessment are mostly limited to individual actions, especially lacking modeling of the asymmetric relations among agents (e.g., between persons and objects); and this limitation undermines their ability to assess actions containing asymmetrically interactive motion patterns, since there always exists subordination between agents in many interactive actions. In this work, we model the asymmetric interactions among agents for action assessment. In particular, we propose an asymmetric interaction module (AIM), to explicitly model asymmetric interactions between intelligent agents within an action, where we group these agents into a primary one (e.g., human) and secondary ones (e.g., objects). We perform experiments on JIGSAWS dataset containing surgical actions, and additionally collect a new dataset, TASD-2, for interactive sporting actions. The experimental results on two interactive action datasets show the effectiveness of our model, and our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The extended experiment on AQA-7 dataset also demonstrates the generalization capability of our framework to conventional action assessment.\"",

        "abstract": "The progressive clustering method and its variants, which iteratively generate pseudo labels for unlabeled data and perform feature learning, have shown great process in unsupervised person re-identification (re-id). However, they have an intrinsic problem of modeling the in-camera variability of images successfully, that is, pedestrian features extracted from the same camera tend to be clustered into the same class. This often results in a non-convergent model in the real world application of clustering based re-id models, leading to degenerated performance. In the present study, we propose an attention-driven two-stage clustering (ADTC) method to solve this problem. Specifically, our method consists of two strategies. Firstly, we use an unsupervised attention kernel to shift the learned features from the image background to the pedestrian foreground, which results in more informative clusters. Secondly, to aid the learning of the attention driven clustering model, we separate the clustering process into two stages. We first use kmeans to generate the centroids of clusters (stage 1) and then apply the k-reciprocal Jaccard distance (KRJD) metric to re-assign data points to each cluster (stage 2). By iteratively learning with the two strategies, the attentive regions are gradually shifted from the background to the foreground and the features become more discriminative. Using two benchmark datasets Market1501 and DukeMTMC, we demonstrate that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches for person re-id.\"",

We introduce four kinds of hyperprior learners by considering inductive vs. transductive, and epoch-dependent vs. epoch-independent, in the paradigm of meta-learning. We conduct extensive experiments for five-class few-shot learning tasks on three challenging benchmarks: miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, and FC100, and achieve top performance using the epoch-dependent transductive hyperprior learner, which captures the richest information. Our ablation study shows that both \"\"epoch-wise ensemble\"\" and \"\"empirical\"\" encourage high efficiency and robustness in the model performance.\"",

However, most of the pruning techniques are essentially trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity which lead to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance. To solve the problem, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity that comprises pattern and connectivity sparsity, and becoming both highly accurate and hardware friendly. With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning unprecedentedly and consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on different DNN structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework also achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning and weight training simultaneously. Our approach on the new pattern-based sparsity naturally fits into compiler optimization for highly efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that mobile devices achieve real-time inference for the large-scale DNN models thanks to the unique spatial property of pattern-based sparsity and the help of the code generation capability of compilers.\"",

The algorithm uses a transformation which transforms a multi-label problem to a 2-label problem on a much larger clique. Earlier algorithms based on this transformation could not handle problems larger than 16 labels on cliques of size 4. The proposed algorithm optimizes the resultant 2-label problem using the submodular polyhedron based Min Norm Point algorithm. The task is challenging because the state space of the transformed problem has a very large number of invalid states. For polyhedral based algorithms the presence of invalid states poses a challenge as apart from numerical instability, the transformation also increases the dimension of the polyhedral space making the straightforward use of known algorithms impractical. The approach reported in this paper allows us to bypass the large costs associated with invalid configurations, resulting in a stable, practical, optimal and efficient inference algorithm that, in our experiments, gives high-quality outputs on problems like pixel-wise object segmentation and stereo matching.\"",

        "abstract": "We present a self-supervised human mesh recovery framework to infer human pose and shape from monocular images in the absence of any paired supervision. Recent advances have shifted the interest towards directly regressing parameters of a parametric human model by supervising them on large-scale, images with 2D landmark annotations. This limits the generalizability of such approaches to operate on samples from unlabeled wild environments. Acknowledging this we propose a novel appearance consensus driven self-supervised objective. To effectively disentangle the foreground (FG) human we rely on image pairs depicting the same person (consistent FG) in varied pose and background (BG) which are obtained from unlabeled wild videos. The proposed FG appearance consistency objective makes use of a novel, differentiable extit{Color-recovery} module to obtain vertex colors without involving any trainable appearance extraction network; via efficient realization of color-picking and reflectional symmetry. We achieve state-of-the-art results on the standard model-based 3D pose estimation benchmarks at comparable supervision levels. Furthermore, the resulting colored mesh prediction opens up usage of our framework for a variety of appearance-related tasks beyond pose and shape estimation, thus establishing our superior generalizability.\"",

In this case, 3D convolution may destroy the appearance representation of person video clips, thus it is harmful to ReID. To address this problem, we propose Appearance-Preserving 3D Convolution (AP3D), which is composed of two components: an Appearance-Preserving Module (APM) and a 3D convolution kernel. With APM aligning the adjacent feature maps in pixel level, the following 3D convolution can model temporal information on the premise of maintaining the appearance representation quality. It is easy to combine AP3D with existing 3D ConvNets by simply replacing the original 3D convolution kernels with AP3Ds. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AP3D for video-based ReID and the results on three widely used datasets surpass the state-of-the-arts.

By a careful study, we find the root cause is that the ideal predictions are beyond the defined range. We design a new rotation detection baseline, to address the boundary problem by transforming angular prediction from a regression problem to a classification task with little accuracy loss, whereby high-precision angle classification is devised in contrast to previous works using coarse-granularity in rotation detection. We also propose a circular smooth label (CSL) technique to handle the periodicity of the angle and increase the error tolerance to adjacent angles. We further introduce four window functions in CSL and explore the effect of different window radius sizes on detection performance. Extensive experiments and visual analysis on two large-scale public datasets for aerial images i.e. DOTA, HRSC2016, as well as scene text dataset ICDAR2015 and MLT, show the effectiveness of our approach.

In this paper, we ask the question: can we find high-quality neural architectures using only images, but no human-annotated labels? To answer this question, we first define a new setup called Unsupervised Neural Architecture Search (UnNAS). We then conduct two sets of experiments. In sample-based experiments, we train a large number (500) of diverse architectures with either supervised or unsupervised objectives, and found that the architecture rankings produced with and without labels are highly correlated. In search-based experiments, we run a well-established NAS algorithm (DARTS) using various unsupervised objectives, and report that the architectures searched without labels can be competitive to their counterparts searched with labels. Together, these results reveal the potentially surprising finding that labels are not necessary, and the image statistics alone may be sufficient to identify good neural architectures. \"",

This expands the size of the effective novel training set by adding extra ``related base'' instances to the few novel ones, thereby allowing a constructive fine-tuning. We propose two associative alignment strategies: 1) a metric-learning loss for minimizing the distance between related base samples and the centroid of novel instances in the feature space, and 2) a conditional adversarial alignment loss based on the Wasserstein distance. Experiments on four standard datasets and three backbones demonstrate that combining our centroid-based alignment loss results in absolute accuracy improvements of 4.4%, 1.2%, and 6.2% in 5-shot learning over the state of the art for object recognition, fine-grained classification, and cross-domain adaptation, respectively. \"",

This information is then jointly reasoned over to produce the most likely explanation of the scene. We train and test our approach on a dataset of indoor scenes, and rigorously evaluate the merits of our joint reasoning approach.

In fact, there is another level of ambiguity that is often overlooked: if RGB and depth data are necessary to fit into the same network. In this paper, we propose an asymmetric two-stream architecture taking account of the inherent differences between RGB and depth data for saliency detection. First, we design a flow ladder module (FLM) for the RGB stream to fully extract global and local information while maintaining the saliency details. This is achieved by constructing four detail-transfer branches, each of which preserves the detail information and receives global location information from representations of other vertical parallel branches in an evolutionary way. Second, we propose a novel depth attention module (DAM) to ensure depth features with high discriminative power in location and spatial structure being effectively utilized when combined with RGB features in challenging scenes. The depth features can also discriminatively guide the RGB features via our proposed DAM to precisely locate the salient objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance over 13 state-of-the-art RGB-D approaches on the 7 datasets. Our code will be publicly available.\"",

We hypothesize that a direct regression to 3D is more effective. A 2D CNN extracts features from each image independently which are then back-projected and accumulated into a voxel volume using the camera intrinsics and extrinsics. After accumulation, a 3D CNN refines the accumulated features and predicts the TSDF values. Additionally, semantic segmentation of the 3D model is obtained without significant computation. This approach is evaluated on Scannet dataset where we significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines (deep multiview stereo followed by traditional TSDF fusion) both quantitatively and qualitatively.

The deployment of common semantic segmentation architectures is not feasible in such settings. In this paper we propose a method to gradually segment a scene given a sequence of partial observations. The main idea is to refine an agent's understanding of the environment by attending the areas it is most uncertain about. Our method includes a self-supervised attention mechanism and a specialized architecture to maintain and exploit spatial memory maps for filling-in the unseen areas in the environment. The agent can select and attend an area while relying on the cues coming from the visited areas to hallucinate the other parts. We reach a mean pixel-wise accuracy of 78.1%, 80.9% and 76.5% on CityScapes, CamVid, and Kitti datasets by processing only 18% of the image pixels (10 retina-like glimpses). We perform an ablation study on the number of glimpses, input image size and effectiveness of retina-like glimpses. We compare our method to several baselines and show that the optimal results are achieved by having access to a very low resolution view of the scene at the first timestep.\"",

        "abstract": "Anomaly localization is an important problem in computer vision which involves localizing anomalous regions within images with applications in industrial inspection, surveillance, and medical imaging. This task is challenging due to the small sample size and pixel coverage of the anomaly in real-world scenarios. Most prior works need to use anomalous training images to compute a class-specific threshold to localize anomalies. Without the need of anomalous training images, we propose Convolutional Adversarial Variational autoencoder with Guided Attention (CAVGA), which localizes the anomaly with a convolutional latent variable to preserve the spatial information. In the unsupervised setting, we propose an attention expansion loss where we encourage CAVGA to focus on all normal regions in the image. Furthermore, in the weakly-supervised setting we propose a complementary guided attention loss, where we encourage the attention map to focus on all normal regions while minimizing the attention map corresponding to anomalous regions in the image. CAVGA outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) anomaly localization methods on MVTec Anomaly Detection (MVTAD), modified ShanghaiTech Campus (mSTC) and Large-scale Attention based Glaucoma (LAG) datasets in the unsupervised setting and when using only 2% anomalous images in the weakly-supervised setting. CAVGA also outperforms SOTA anomaly detection methods on the MNIST, CIFAR-10,Fashion-MNIST, MVTAD, mSTC and LAG datasets.\"",

        "abstract": "Query expansion is a technique widely used in image search consisting in combining highly ranked images from an original query into an expanded query that is then reissued, generally leading to increased recall and precision. An important aspect of query expansion is choosing an appropriate way to combine the images into a new query. Interestingly, despite the undeniable empirical success of query expansion, ad-hoc methods with different caveats have dominated the landscape, and not a lot of research has been done on learning how to do query expansion. In this paper we propose a more principled framework to query expansion, where one trains, in a discriminative manner, a model that learns how images should be aggregated to form the expanded query. Within this framework, we propose a model that leverages a self-attention mechanism to effectively learn how to transfer information between the different images before aggregating them. Our approach obtains higher accuracy than existing approaches on standard benchmarks. More importantly, our approach is the only one that consistently shows high accuracy under different regimes, overcoming caveats of existing methods.\"",

Our goal is to eliminate such bias and enhance the robustness of the learnt features. To this end, we propose an Attention-Driven Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (ADD-GCN) to dynamically generate a specific graph for each image. ADD-GCN adopts a Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (D-GCN) to model the relation of content-aware category representations that are generated by a Semantic Attention Module (SAM).

Towards a principled way of applying attention to videos, we address the task of spatiotemporal attention cell search. We propose a novel search space for spatiotemporal attention cells, which allows the search algorithm to flexibly explore various design choices in the cell.

Instead of learning a single affine transformation, AN learns a mixture of affine transformations and utilizes their weighted-sum as the final affine transformation applied to re-calibrate features in an instance-specific way. The weights are learned by leveraging channel-wise feature attention. In experiments, we test the proposed AN using four representative neural architectures (ResNets, DenseNets, MobileNets-v2 and AOGNets) in the ImageNet-1000 classification benchmark and the MS-COCO 2017 object detection and instance segmentation benchmark. AN obtains consistent performance improvement for different neural architectures in both benchmarks with absolute increase of top-1 accuracy in ImageNet-1000 between 0.5% and 2.7%, and absolute increase up to 1.8% and 2.2% for bounding box and mask AP in MS-COCO respectively. We observe that the proposed AN provides a strong alternative to the widely used Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) module. Our reproducible source code is publicly available.\"",

Our contributions include (1) a new embedding structure to encode relative spatial relationships between features by applying a capsule network; (2) a new triplet loss designated to enhance the semantic feature embedding where similar samples are close to each other while dissimilar samples are farther apart; and (3) an effective non-parametric classifier termed attentive prototypes in place of the simple prototypes in current few-shot learning. The proposed attentive prototype aggregates all of the instances in a support class which are weighted by their importance, defined by the reconstruction error for a given query. The reconstruction error allows the classification posterior probability to be estimated, which corresponds to the classification confidence score.

The novel setting of the semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) problem shares the challenges with the domain adaptation problem and the semi-supervised learning problem. However, a recent study shows that conventional domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning methods often result in less effective or negative transfer in the SSDA problem. In order to interpret the observation and address the SSDA problem, in this paper, we raise the intra-domain discrepancy issue within the target domain, which has never been discussed so far. Then, we demonstrate that addressing the intra-domain discrepancy leads to the ultimate goal of the SSDA problem. We propose an SSDA framework that aims to align features via alleviation of the intra-domain discrepancy. Our framework mainly consists of three schemes, i.e., attraction, perturbation, and exploration. First, the attraction scheme globally minimizes the intra-domain discrepancy within the target domain. Second, we demonstrate the incompatibility of the conventional adversarial perturbation methods with SSDA. Then, we present a domain adaptive adversarial perturbation scheme, which perturbs the given target samples in a way that reduces the intra-domain discrepancy. Finally, the exploration scheme locally aligns features in a class-wise manner complementary to the attraction scheme by selectively aligning unlabeled target features complementary to the perturbation scheme. We conduct extensive experiments on domain adaptation benchmark datasets such as DomainNet, Office-Home, and Office. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performances on all datasets.\"",

In this work, we study the problem of attributional robustness (i.e. models having robust explanations) by showing an upper bound for attributional vulnerability in terms of spatial correlation between the input image and its explanation map. We propose a training methodology that learns robust features by minimizing this upper bound using soft-margin triplet loss.

We propose an efficient alternative for optimal synthetic data generation, based on a novel differentiable approximation of the objective. This allows us to optimize the simulator, which may be non-differentiable, requiring only one objective evaluation at each iteration with a little overhead. We demonstrate on a state-of-the-art photorealistic renderer that the proposed method finds the optimal data distribution faster (up to 50 times), with significantly reduced training data generation and better accuracy than previous methods.\"",

        "abstract": "We consider graph-based semi-supervised learning that leverages a similarity graph across data points to better exploit data structure exposed in unlabeled data. One challenge that arises in this problem context is that conventional matrix completion which can serve to construct a similarity graph entails heavy computational overhead, since it re-trains the graph independently whenever model parameters of an interested classifier are updated. In this paper, we propose a holistic approach that employs a parameterized neural-net-based autoencoder for matrix completion, thereby enabling simultaneous training between models of the classifier and matrix completion. We find that this approach not only speeds up training time (around a three-fold improvement over a prior approach), but also offers a higher prediction accuracy via a more accurate graph estimate. We demonstrate that our algorithm obtains state-of-the-art performances by respectful margins on benchmark datasets: Achieving the error rates of 0.57\\% on MNIST with 100 labels; 3.48\\% on SVHN with 1000 labels; and 6.87\\% on CIFAR-10 with 4000 labels.\"",

Taking inspiration from autoregressive generative models, that predict the current pixel from past pixels in a raster-scan ordering created with masked convolutions, we propose different autoregressive orderings over the inputs using various forms of masked convolutions to construct different views of the data. For a given input, the model produces a pair of predictions with two valid orderings, and is then trained to maximize the mutual information between the two outputs. These outputs can either be low-dimensional features for representation learning or output clusters corresponding to semantic labels for clustering. While masked convolutions are used during training, in inference, no masking is applied and we fall back to the standard convolution where the model has access to the full input. The proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art on unsupervised image segmentation. It is simple and easy to implement, and can be extended to other visual tasks and integrated seamlessly into existing unsupervised learning methods requiring different views of the data.\"",

Recent works prove it possible to stack self-attention layers to obtain a fully attentional network by restricting the attention to a local region. In this paper, we attempt to remove this constraint by factorizing 2D self-attention into two 1D self-attentions. This reduces computation complexity and allows performing attention within a larger or even global region. In companion, we also propose a position-sensitive self-attention design. Combining both yields our position-sensitive axial-attention layer, a novel building block that one could stack to form axial-attention models for image classification and dense prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on four large-scale datasets. In particular, our model outperforms all existing stand-alone self-attention models on ImageNet. Our Axial-DeepLab improves 2.8% PQ over bottom-up state-of-the-art on COCO test-dev.

We design these steps by constraining the joint angles to respect the kinematic constraints of the human body and by using accurate mesh convolution-based networks to capture identity-specific surface variation. We provide quantitative results on the problem of reconstructing a collection of 3D human scans, and show that we obtain improvements in reconstruction accuracy when comparing to a SMPL-type baseline.

Hence, we propose the utilization of backpropagated gradients as representations to characterize model behavior on anomalies and, consequently, detect such anomalies.

To reveal the secrets behind the scene, we present VALUE (Vision-And-Language Understanding Evaluation), a set of meticulously designed probing tasks (e.g., Visual Coreference Resolution, Visual Relation Detection) generalizable to standard pre-trained V+L models, to decipher the inner workings of multimodal pre-training (e.g., implicit knowledge garnered in individual attention heads, inherent cross-modal alignment learned through contextualized multimodal embeddings). Through extensive analysis of each archetypal model architecture via these probing tasks, our key observations are: (i) Pre-trained models exhibit a propensity for attending over text rather than images during inference. (ii) There exists a subset of attention heads that are tailored for capturing cross-modal interactions. (iii) Learned attention matrix in pre-trained models demonstrates patterns coherent with the latent alignment between image regions and textual words. (iv) Plotted attention patterns reveal visually-interpretable relations among image regions. (v) Pure linguistic knowledge is also effectively encoded in the attention heads.

        "abstract": "Recently, deep learning based 3D face reconstruction methods have shown promising results in both quality and efficiency. However, most of their training data is constructed by 3D Morphable Model, whose space spanned is only a small part of the shape space. As a result, the reconstruction results lose the fine-grained geometry and look different from real faces. To alleviate this issue, we first propose a solution to construct large-scale fine-grained 3D data from RGB-D images, which are expected to be massively collected as the proceeding of hand-held depth camera. A new dataset Fine-Grained 3D face (FG3D) with 200k samples is constructed to provide sufficient data for neural network training. Secondly, we propose a Fine-Grained reconstruction Network (FGNet) that can concentrate on shape modification by warping the network input and output to the UV space. Through FG3D and FGNet, we successfully generate reconstruction results with fine-grained geometry. The experiments on several benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method compared to several baselines and other state-of-the-art methods. \"",

Whilst various outdoor benchmarks exist that target lighting, weather and seasonal changes, far less attention has been paid to appearance changes that occur indoors. This has led to a mismatch between popular indoor benchmarks, which focus on static scenes, and indoor environments that are of interest for many real-world applications. In this paper, we adapt 3RScan -- a recently introduced indoor RGB-D dataset designed for object instance re-localization -- to create RIO10, a new long-term camera re-localization benchmark focused on indoor scenes. We propose new metrics for evaluating camera re-localization and explore how state-of-the-art camera re-localizers perform according to these metrics. We also examine in detail how different types of scene change affect the performance of different methods, based on novel ways of detecting such changes in a given RGB-D frame. Our results clearly show that long-term indoor re-localization is an unsolved problem. Our benchmark and tools are publicly available at waldjohannau.github.io/RIO10\"",

We argue that deforming the grid to better align with the high-frequency image content is a more effective strategy. We introduce mph{Deformable Grid} (Defgrid), a learnable neural network module that predicts location offsets of vertices of a 2-dimensional triangular grid such that the edges of the deformed grid align with image boundaries. We showcase our Defgrid in a variety of use cases, i.e., by inserting it as a module at various levels of processing. We utilize Defgrid as an end-to-end mph{learnable geometric downsampling} layer that replaces standard pooling methods for reducing feature resolution when feeding images into a deep CNN. We show significantly improved results at the same grid resolution compared to using CNNs on uniform grids for the task of semantic segmentation. We also utilize Defgrid at the output layers for the task of object mask annotation, and show that reasoning about object boundaries on our predicted polygonal grid leads to more accurate results over existing pixel-wise and curve-based approaches. We finally showcase DefGrid as a standalone module for unsupervised image segmentation, showing superior performance over existing superpixel-based approaches.

Most existing de-rain algorithms use only one single input image and aim to recover a clean image. Few work has exploited stereo images. Moreover, even for single image based monocular deraining, many current methods fail to complete the task satisfactorily because they mostly rely on per pixel loss functions and ignoring semantic information. In this paper, we present a Paired Rain Removal Network (PRRNet), which exploits both stereo images and semantic information. Specifically, we develop a Semantic-Aware Deraining Module (SADM) which solves both tasks of semantic segmentation and deraining of scenes, and a Semantic-Fusion Network (SFNet) and a View-Fusion Network (VFNet) which fuses semantic information and multi-view information respectively. We also propose a new stereo based rainy datasets for benchmarking. Experiments on both monocular and the newly proposed stereo rainy datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.\"",

        "abstract": "Adversarial examples are inputs with imperceptible perturbations that easily misleading deep neural networks (DNNs). Recently, adversarial patch, with noise confined to a small and localized patch, has emerged for its easy feasibility in real-world scenarios. However, existing strategies failed to generate adversarial patches with strong generalization ability. In other words, the adversarial patches were input-specific and failed to attack images from all classes, especially unseen ones during training. To address the problem, this paper proposes a bias-based framework to generate class-agnostic universal adversarial patches with strong generalization ability, which exploits both the perceptual and semantic bias of models. Regarding the perceptual bias, since DNNs are strongly biased towards textures, we exploit the hard examples which convey strong model uncertainties and extract a textural patch prior from them by adopting the style similarities. The patch prior is more close to decision boundaries and would promote attacks. To further alleviate the heavy dependency on large amounts of data in training universal attacks, we further exploit the semantic bias. As the class-wise preference, prototypes are introduced and pursued by maximizing the multi-class margin to help universal training. Taking Automatic Check-out (ACO) as the typical scenario, extensive experiments including white-box/black-box settings in both digital-world (RPC, the largest ACO related dataset) and physical-world scenario (Taobao and JD, the world\u2019s largest online shopping platforms) are conducted. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial patch attack methods. \"",

        "abstract": "Neural architecture search (NAS) methods have shown promising results discovering models that are both accurate and fast. For NAS, training a one-shot model has became a popular strategy to rank the relative quality of different architectures (child models) using a single set of shared weights. However, while one-shot model weights can effectively rank different network architectures, the absolute accuracies from these shared weights are typically far below those obtained from stand-alone training. To compensate, existing methods assume that the weights must be retrained, finetuned, or otherwise post-processed after the search is completed. These steps significantly increase the compute requirements and complexity of the architecture search and model deployment. In this work, we propose BigNAS, an approach that challenges the conventional wisdom that post-processing of the weights is necessary to get good prediction accuracies. Without extra retraining or post-processing steps, we are able to train a single set of shared weights on ImageNet and use these weights to obtain child models whose sizes range from 200 to 1000 MFLOPs. Our discovered model family, BigNASModels, achieve top-1 accuracies ranging from 76.5% to 80.9%, surpassing state-of-the-art models in this range including EfficientNets and Once-for-All networks without extra retraining or post-processing. We present ablative study and analysis to further understand the proposed BigNASModels.\"",

        "abstract": "We present BioMetricNet: a novel framework for deep unconstrained face verification which learns a regularized metric to compare facial features. Differently from popular methods such as FaceNet, the proposed approach does not impose any specific metric on facial features; instead, it shapes the decision space by learning a latent representation in which matching and non-matching pairs are mapped onto clearly separated and well-behaved target distributions. In particular, the network jointly learns the best feature representation, and the best metric that follows the target distributions, to be used to discriminate face images. In this paper we present this general framework, first of its kind for facial verification, and tailor it to Gaussian distributions. This choice enables the use of a simple linear decision boundary that can be tuned to achieve the desired trade-off between false alarm and genuine acceptance rate, and leads to a loss function that can be written in closed form. Extensive analysis and experimentation on publicly available datasets such as Labeled Faces in the wild (LFW), Youtube faces (YTF), Celebrities in Frontal-Profile in the Wild (CFP), and challenging datasets like cross-age LFW (CALFW), cross-pose LFW (CPLFW), In-the-wild Age Dataset (AgeDB) show a significant performance improvement and confirms the effectiveness and superiority of BioMetricNet over existing state-of-the-art methods.\"",

        "abstract": "Recent reference-based face restoration methods have received considerable attention due to their great capability in recovering high-frequency details on real low-quality images. However, most of these methods require a high-quality reference image of the same identity, making them only applicable in limited scenes. To address this issue, this paper suggests a deep face dictionary network (termed as DFDNet) to guide the restoration process of degraded observations. To begin with, we use K-means to generate deep dictionaries for perceptually significant face components (i.e., left/right eyes, nose and mouth) from high-quality images. Next, with the degraded input, we match and select the most similar component features from their corresponding dictionaries and transfer the high-quality details to the input via the proposed dictionary feature transfer (DFT) block. In particular, component AdaIN is leveraged to eliminate the style diversity between the input and dictionary features (e.g., illumination), and a confidence score is proposed to adaptively fuse the dictionary feature to the input. Finally, multi-scale dictionaries are adopted in a progressive manner to enable the coarse-to-fine restoration. Experiments show that our proposed method can achieve plausible performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluation, and more importantly, can generate realistic and promising results on real degraded images without requiring an identity-belonging reference.

To more effectively utilize the source dataset, we propose to iteratively transfer the knowledge from the source domain by a one-class universal detector and learn the target-domain detector. The box-level pseudo ground truths mined by the target-domain detector in each iteration effectively improve the one-class universal detector. Therefore, the knowledge in the source dataset is more thoroughly exploited and leveraged. Extensive experiments are conducted with Pascal VOC 2007 as the target weakly-annotated dataset and COCO/ImageNet as the source fully-annotated dataset. With the proposed solution, we achieved an mAP of $59.7\\%$ detection performance on the VOC test set and an mAP of $60.2\\%$ after retraining a fully supervised Faster RCNN with the mined pseudo ground truths.

        "abstract": "Recently, temporal action localization (TAL), extit{i.e.}, finding specific action segments in untrimmed videos, has attracted increasing attentions of the computer vision community. State-of-the-art solutions for TAL involves evaluating the frame-level probabilities of three action-indicating phases, extit{i.e.} starting, continuing, and ending; and then post-processing these predictions for the final localization. This paper delves deep into this mechanism, and argues that existing methods, by modeling these phases as individual classification tasks, ignored the potential temporal constraints between them. This can lead to incorrect and/or inconsistent predictions when some frames of the video input lack sufficient discriminative information. To alleviate this problem, we introduce two regularization terms to mutually regularize the learning procedure: the Intra-phase Consistency (IntraC) regularization is proposed to make the predictions verified inside each phase; and the Inter-phase Consistency (InterC) regularization is proposed to keep consistency between these phases. Jointly optimizing these two terms, the entire framework is aware of these potential constraints during an end-to-end optimization process. Experiments are performed on two popular TAL datasets, THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3. Our approach clearly outperforms the baseline both quantitatively and qualitatively. The proposed regularization also generalizes to other TAL methods ( extit{e.g.}, TSA-Net and PGCN). code: https://github.com/PeisenZhao/Bottom-Up-TAL-with-MR\"",

In this paper, we propose the bounding-box channels, a novel architecture capable of relating the semantic, spatial, and image features strongly. Our network learns bounding-box channels, which are initialized according to the position of the objects and the label of objects, and concatenated to the image features extracted from the objects. Then, they are input together to the relationship estimator. Our method can retain the spatial information in the image features, and strongly associate them with the semantic and spatial features. This way, our method is capable of effectively emphasizing the features in the object area for a better modeling of the relationships within objects. In addition, we experimentally show that our bounding-box channels have a high generalization ability. Our evaluation results show the efficacy of our architecture outperforming previous works in visual relationship detection. \"",

In this paper, we present a unified formulation of these two constructs, where a scene graph is seen as an image-conditioned instantiation of a commonsense knowledge graph. Based on this new perspective, we re-formulate scene graph generation as the inference of a bridge between the scene and commonsense graphs, where each entity or predicate instance in the scene graph has to be linked to its corresponding entity or predicate class in the commonsense graph. To this end, we propose a novel graph-based neural network that iteratively propagates information between the two graphs, as well as within each of them, while gradually refining their bridge in each iteration. Our Graph Bridging Network, GB-Net, successively infers edges and nodes, allowing to simultaneously exploit and refine the rich, heterogeneous structure of the interconnected scene and commonsense graphs.

In BroadFace, a linear classifier learns optimal decision boundaries among identities from a large number of embedding vectors accumulated over past iterations. By referring more instances at once, the optimality of the classifier is naturally increased on the entire datasets. Thus, the encoder is also globally optimized by referring the weight matrix of the classifier. Moreover, we propose a novel compensation method to increase the number of referenced instances in the training stage. BroadFace can be easily applied on many existing methods to accelerate a learning process and obtain a significant improvement in accuracy without extra computational burden at inference stage. We perform extensive ablation studies and experiments on various datasets to show the effectiveness of BroadFace, and also empirically prove the validity of our compensation method. BroadFace achieves the state-of-the-art results with significant improvements on nine datasets in 1:1 face verification and 1:N face identification tasks, and is also effective in image retrieval.\"",

Long exposures can improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) but undesirable motion blur can occur when capturing dynamic scenes. As a result, imaging pipelines often rely on computational photography to improve SNR by fusing multiple short exposures. Recent deep neural network-based methods have been shown to generate visually pleasing results by fusing these exposures in a sophisticated manner, but often at a higher computational cost.",

In this paper we present B\u00e9zierSketch, a novel generative model for fully vector sketches that are automatically scalable and high-resolution. To this end, we first introduce a novel inverse graphics approach to stroke embedding that trains an encoder to embed each stroke to its best fit B\u00e9zier curve.

In this work, we address this shortcoming by introducing CAD-Deform, a method which obtains more accurate CAD-to-scan fits by non-rigidly deforming retrieved CAD models. Our key contribution is a new non-rigid deformation model incorporating smooth transformations and preservation of sharp features, that simultaneously achieves very tight fits from CADs to the 3D scan and in addition maintains the clean, high-quality surface properties of hand-modeled CAD objects.

There have been some works in multi-domain transfer problem focusing on facial attribute editing employing Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). These methods have reported some successes but they also result in unintended changes in facial regions - meaning the generator alters regions unrelated to the specified attributes. To address this unintended altering problem, we propose a novel GAN model which is designed to edit only the parts of a face pertinent to the target attributes by the concept of Complementary Attention Feature (CAFE). CAFE identifies the facial regions to be transformed by considering both target attributes as well as nquote{complementary attributes}, which we define as those attributes absent in the input facial image. In addition, we introduce a complementary feature matching to help in training the generator for utilizing the spatial information of attributes. Effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by analysis and comparison study with state-of-the-art methods.\"",

Compared to conventional depth losses manually defined on a per-pixel basis, the proposed hierarchical loss can be learned in a data-driven manner. As verified by our experiments, the hierarchical loss even learned without additional labels can capture multi-scale context information, is more robust to local outliers, and thus delivers superior performance. To further improve depth accuracy, a cross level identity feature fusion network (CLIFFNet) is proposed, where low-level features with finer details are refined using more reliable high-level cues. Through end-to-end training, CLIFFNet can learn to select the optimal combinations of low-level and high-level features, leading to more effective cross level feature fusion.

        "abstract": "Unsupervised image-to-image translation intends to learn a mapping of an image in a given domain to an analogous image in a different domain, without explicit supervision of the mapping. Few-shot unsupervised image-to-image translation further attempts to generalize the model to an unseen domain by leveraging example images of the unseen domain provided at inference time. While remarkably successful, existing few-shot image-to-image translation models find it difficult to preserve the structure of the input image while emulating the appearance of the unseen domain, which we refer to as the extit{content loss} problem. This is particularly severe when the poses of the objects in the input and example images are very different. To address the issue, we propose a new few-shot image translation model, COCO-FUNIT, which computes the style embedding of the example images conditioned on the input image and a new module called the constant style bias. Through extensive experimental validations with comparison to the state-of-the-art, our model shows effectiveness in addressing the extit{content loss} problem.

If this new technology is to find practical uses, we need to achieve a level of control over generative networks which, without sacrificing realism, is on par with that seen in computer graphics and character animation. To this end we propose ConfigNet, a neural face model that allows for controlling individual aspects of output images in semantically meaningful ways and that is a significant step on the path towards finely-controllable neural rendering. ConfigNet is trained on real face images as well as synthetic face renders. Our novel method uses synthetic data to factorize the latent space into elements that correspond to the inputs of a traditional rendering pipeline, separating aspects such as head pose, facial expression, hair style, illumination, and many others which are very hard to annotate in real data. The real images, which are presented to the network without labels, extend the variety of the generated images and encourage realism. Finally, we propose an evaluation criterion using an attribute detection network combined with a user study and demonstrate state-of-the-art individual control over attributes in the output images.\"",

In this paper we circumvent this problem by focusing on parsing the content of both the input text and the synthesized image thoroughly to model the text-to-image consistency in the semantic level. Particularly, we design a memory structure to parse the textual content by exploring semantic correspondence between each word in the vocabulary to its various visual contexts across relevant images during text encoding. Meanwhile, the synthesized image is parsed to learn its semantics in an object-aware manner. Moreover, we customize a conditional discriminator to model the fine-grained correlations between words and image sub-regions to push for the text-image semantic alignment.

To address above challenges, we develop a new Critical Semantic-Consistent Learning (CSCL) model, which mitigates the discrepancy of both domain-wise and category-wise distributions. Specifically, a critical transfer based adversarial framework is designed to highlight transferable domain-wise knowledge while neglecting untransferable knowledge. Transferability-critic guides transferability-quantizer to maximize positive transfer gain under reinforcement learning manner, although negative transfer of untransferable knowledge occurs. Meanwhile, with the help of confidence-guided pseudo labels generator of target samples, a symmetric soft divergence loss is presented to explore inter-class relationships and facilitate category-wise distribution alignment.

This allows us to recover metric 3D reconstructions without explicitly estimating the cameras' focal length or radial distortion parameters. The weaker projection model makes initializing the reconstruction especially difficult. To handle this additional challenge we propose two novel minimal solvers for radial trifocal tensor estimation.

        "abstract": "The ubiquity of smartphone cameras has led to more and more documents being captured by cameras rather than scanned. Unlike flatbed scanners, photographed documents are often folded and crumpled, resulting in large local variance in text structure. The problem of document rectification is fundamental to the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process on documents, and its ability to overcome geometric distortions significantly affects recognition accuracy. Despite the great progress in recent OCR systems, most still rely on a pre-process that ensures the text lines are straight and axis aligned. Recent works have tackled the problem of rectifying document images taken in-the-wild using various supervision signals and alignment means. However, they focused on global features that can be extracted from the document's boundaries, ignoring various signals that could be obtained from the document's content. We present CREASE: Content Aware Rectification using Angle Supervision, the first learned method for document rectification that relies on the document's content, the location of the words and specifically their orientation, as hints to assist in the rectification process. We utilize a novel pixel-wise angle regression approach and a curvature estimation side-task for optimizing our rectification model. Our method surpasses previous approaches in terms of OCR accuracy, geometric error and visual similarity.",

        "abstract": "The advances over the past several years have pushed the performance of face recognition to an amazing level. This great success, to a large extent, is built on top of millions of annotated samples. However, as we endeavor to take the performance to the next level, the reliance on annotated data becomes a major obstacle. We desire to explore an alternative approach, namely using captioned images for training, as an attempt to mitigate this difficulty. Captioned images are widely available on the web, while the captions often contain the names of the subjects in the images. Hence, an effective method to leverage such data would significantly reduce the need of human annotations. However, an important challenge along this way needs to be tackled: the names in the captions are often noisy and ambiguous, especially when there are multiple names in the captions or multiple people in the photos. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method, which trains a face recognition model by progressively expanding the labeled set via both selective propagation and caption-driven expansion. We build a large-scale dataset of captioned images, which contain 6.3M faces from 305K subjects. Our experiments show that using the proposed method, we can train a state-of-the-art face recognition model without manual annotation (99.65% in LFW). This shows the great potential of caption-supervised face recognition.\"",

A major technical challenge for detecting salient objects in RGB-D images is to fully leverage the two complementary data sources. The existing works either simply distill prior knowledge from the corresponding depth map to handle the RGB-image or blindly fuse color and geometric information to generate the depth-aware representations, hindering the performance of RGB-D saliency detectors. In this work, we introduce Cascade Graph Neural Networks (Cas-Gnn), a unified framework which is capable of comprehensively distilling and reasoning the mutual benefit between these two data sources through a set of cascade graphs, to learn powerful representations for RGB-D salient object detection. Cas-Gnn processes the two data sources separately and employs a novel Cascade Graph Reasoning (CGR) module to learn the powerful dense feature embeddings so that the saliency map can be easily inferred. Different from previous approaches, Cas-Gnn, by explicitly modeling and reasoning high-level relations between complementary data sources, can overcome many challenges like occlusions and ambiguities. Extensive experiments on several widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that CasGnn achieves significantly better performance than all existing RGB-D SOD approaches.\"",

In this paper we combine a gradient-based fitting procedure with a parametric neural image synthesis module that is capable of implicitly representing the appearance, shape and pose of entire object categories, thus rendering the need for explicit CAD models per object instance unnecessary. The image synthesis network is designed to efficiently span the pose configuration space so that model capacity can be used to capture the shape and local appearance (i.e., texture) variations jointly. At inference time the synthesized images are compared to the target via an appearance based loss and the error signal is backpropagated through the network to the input parameters, i.e. poses and appearances. Keeping the network parameters fixed, this allows for iterative optimization of the object pose, shape and appearance in a joint manner and we experimentally show that the method can recover orientation of objects with high accuracy from 2D images alone. When provided with depth measurements, to overcome scale ambiguities, the method can accurately recover the full 6DOF pose successfully. \"",

Among them, face anti-spoofing emerges as an important area, whose objective is to identify whether a presented face is live or spoof. Though promising progress has been achieved, existing works still have difficulty in handling complex spoof attacks and generalizing to real-world scenarios. The main reason is that current face anti-spoofing datasets are limited in both quantity and diversity. To overcome these obstacles, we contribute a large-scale face anti-spoofing dataset, extbf{CelebA-Spoof}, with the following appealing properties: extit{1) Quantity:} CelebA-Spoof comprises of 625,537 pictures of 10,177 subjects, significantly larger than the existing datasets. extit{2) Diversity:} The spoof images are captured from 8 scenes (2 environments all_papers.txt decode_tex_noligatures.sh decode_tex_noligatures.sh~ decode_tex.sh decode_tex.sh~ ECCV_abstracts.csv ECCV_abstracts_good.csv ECCV_abstracts_good.csv.old ECCV_abstracts_ori.csv ECCV.csv ECCV.csv~ ECCV_new.csv generate_list.sh generate_list.sh~ generate_overview.sh generate_overview.sh~ gen.sh pdflist pdflist.copied RCS snippet.html 4 illumination conditions) with more than 10 sensors. extit{3) Annotation Richness:} CelebA-Spoof contains 10 spoof type annotations, as well as the 40 attribute annotations inherited from the original CelebA dataset.

The fact that two-stage detectors are generally slow makes it difficult to apply in real-time scenarios. Moreover, adapting directly existing methods to a one-stage detector is inefficient or infeasible. In this work, we introduce a method based on a one-stage detector called CenterNet. We propagate the previous reliable long-term detection in the form of heatmap to boost results of upcoming image. Our method achieves the online real-time performance on ImageNet VID dataset with 76.7% mAP at 37 FPS and the offline performance 78.4% mAP at 34 FPS.\"",

        "abstract": "Existing Multiple-Object Tracking (MOT) methods either follow the tracking-by-detection paradigm to conduct object detection, feature extraction and data association separately, or have two of the three subtasks integrated to form a partially end-to-end solution. Going beyond these sub-optimal frameworks, we propose a simple online model named Chained-Tracker (CTracker), which naturally integrates all the three subtasks into an end-to-end solution (the first as far as we know). It chains paired bounding boxes regression results estimated from overlapping nodes, of which each node covers two adjacent frames. The paired regression is made attentive by object-attention (brought by a detection module) and identity-attention (ensured by an ID verification module). The two major novelties: chained structure and paired attentive regression, make CTracker simple, fast and effective, setting new MOTA records on MOT16 and MOT17 challenge datasets (67.6 and 66.6, respectively), without relying on any extra training data. The source code of CTracker can be found at: github.com/pjl1995/CTracker.\"",

In this paper, we propose a novel challenge-aware neural network to handle the modality-shared challenges (e.g., fast motion, scale variation and occlusion) and the modality-specific ones (e.g., illumination variation and thermal crossover) for RGBT tracking. In particular, we design several parameter-shared branches in each layer to model the target appearance under the modality-shared challenges, and several parameter-independent branches under the modality-specific ones. Based on the observation that the modality-specific cues of different modalities usually contains the complementary advantages, we propose a guidance module to transfer discriminative features from one modality to another one, which could enhance the discriminative ability of some weak modality. Moreover, all branches are aggregated together in an adaptive manner and parallel embedded in the backbone network to efficiently form more discriminative target representations. These challenge-aware branches are able to model the target appearance under certain challenges so that the target representations can be learnt by a few parameters even in the situation of insufficient training data. From the experimental results we will show that our method operates at a real-time speed while performing well against the state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets.\"",

        "abstract": "A scene text spotter is composed of text detection and recognition modules. Many studies have been conducted to unify these modules into an end-to-end trainable model to achieve better performance. A typical architecture places detection and recognition modules into separate branches, and a RoI pooling is commonly used to let the branches share a visual feature. However, there still exists a chance of establishing a more complimentary connection between the modules when adopting recognizer that uses attention-based decoder and detector that represents spatial information of the character regions. This is possible since the two modules share a common sub-task which is to find the location of the character regions. Based on the insight, we construct a tightly coupled single pipeline model. This architecture is formed by utilizing detection outputs in the recognizer and propagating the recognition loss through the detection stage. The use of character score map helps the recognizer attend better to the character center points, and the recognition loss propagation to the detector module enhances the localization of the character regions. Also, a strengthened sharing stage allows feature rectification and boundary localization of arbitrary-shaped text regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in publicly available straight and curved benchmark dataset.\"",

Different from video generation that focuses on maintaining the continuity of generated images (frames), story visualization emphasizes preserving the global consistency of characters and scenes across different story pictures, which is very challenging since story sentences only provide sparse signals for generating images. Therefore, we propose a new framework named Character-Preserving Coherent Story Visualization (CP-CSV) to tackle the challenges. CP-CSV effectively learns to visualize the story by three critical modules: story and context encoder (story and sentence representation learning), figure-ground segmentation (auxiliary task to provide information for preserving character and story consistency), and figure-ground aware generation (image sequence generation by incorporating figure-ground information). Moreover, we propose a metric named Fr\\'{e}chet Story Distance (FSD) to evaluate the performance of story visualization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CP-CSV maintains the details of character information and achieves high consistency among different frames, while FSD better measures the performance of story visualization.\"",

To build such an efficient paradigm, we reduce the potential redundancy by carefully extracting useful samples from the original images, assembling samples in a Montage manner as input, and using an ERF-adaptive dense classification strategy for model pre-training. These designs include not only a new input pattern to improve the spatial utilization but also a novel learning objective to expand the effective receptive field of the pre-trained model. The efficiency and effectiveness of Montage pre-training are validated by extensive experiments on the MS-COCO dataset, where the results indicate that the models using Montage pre-training are able to achieve on-par or even better detection performances compared with the ImageNet pre-training.",

        "abstract": "Despite great progress in supervised semantic segmentation, a large performance drop is usually observed when deploying the model in the wild. Domain adaptation methods tackle the issue by aligning the source domain and the target domain. However, most existing methods attempt to perform the alignment from a holistic view, ignoring the underlying class-level data structure in the target domain. To fully exploit the supervision in the source domain, we propose a fine-grained adversarial learning strategy for class-level feature alignment while preserving the internal structure of semantics across domains. We adopt a fine-grained domain discriminator that not only plays as a domain distinguisher, but also differentiates domains at class level. The traditional binary domain labels are also generalized to domain encodings as the supervision signal to guide a fine-grained feature alignment. An analysis with Class Center Distance (CCD) validates that our fine-grained adversarial strategy achieves better class-level alignment compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Our method is easy to implement and its effectiveness is evaluated on three classical domain adaptation tasks, i.e., GTA5 $ o$ Cityscapes, SYNTHIA $ o$ Cityscapes, Cityscapes $ o$ Cross-City. Large performance gains show that our method outperforms other global feature alignment based and class-wise alignment based counterparts.

Since the abnormal events are usually different from normal events in appearance and/or in motion behavior, we address this issue by designing a novel convolution autoencoder architecture to separately capture spatial and temporal informative representation. The spatial part reconstructs the last individual frame (LIF), and the temporal part generates the RGB difference between the rest of video frames and the LIF, where the fast obtained RGB difference cue can learn useful motion features. Two sub-modules independently learn the regularity from appearance and motion feature space, the abnormal events which are irregular in appearance or in motion behavior lead to a large reconstruction error. Besides, we design a deep k-means cluster constraint to force both the appearance encoder and the motion encoder to extract common factors of variation within the dataset by penalizing the distance of each data representation to cluster centers. Experiments on some publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method which detects abnormal events in videos with competitive performance.\"",

        "abstract": "Within medical imaging, organ/pathology segmentation models trained on current publicly available and fully-annotated datasets usually do not well-represent the heterogeneous modalities, phases, pathologies, and clinical scenarios encountered in real environments. On the other hand, there are tremendous amounts of unlabelled patient imaging scans stored by many modern clinical centers. In this work, we present a novel segmentation strategy, co-heterogenous andadaptive segmentation (CHASe), which only requires a small labeled cohort of single phase data to adapt to any unlabeled cohort of heterogenous multi-phase data with possibly new clinical scenarios and pathologies. To do this, we develop a versatile framework that fuses appearance-based semi-supervision, mask-based adversarial domain adaptation, and pseudo-labeling. We also introduce co-heterogeneous training, which is a novel integration of co-training and hetero-modality learning. We evaluate CHASe using a clinically comprehensive and challenging dataset of multi-phase computed tomography (CT) imaging studies (1147 patients and 4577 3D volumes), with a test set of 100 patients. Compared to previous state-of-the-art baselines, CHASe can further improve pathological liver mask Dice-S\u00f8rensen coefficients by ranges of 4.2% to 9.4%, depending on the phase combinations, e.g., from 84.6% to 94.0% on non-contrast CTs.\"",

Building on common encoder-decoder architectures for this task, we propose three extensions: (1) ray-traced skip connections that propagate local 2D information to the output 3D volume in a physically correct manner; (2) a hybrid 3D volume representation that enables building translation equivariant models, while at the same time encoding fine object details without an excessive memory footprint; (3) a reconstruction loss tailored to capture overall object geometry. Furthermore, we adapt our model to address the harder task of reconstructing multiple objects from a single image. We reconstruct all objects jointly in one pass, producing a coherent reconstruction, where all objects live in a single consistent 3D coordinate frame relative to the camera and they do not intersect in 3D space. We also handle occlusions and resolve them by hallucinating the missing object parts in the 3D volume. We validate the impact of our contributions experimentally both on synthetic data from ShapeNet as well as real images from Pix3D. Our method improves over the state-of-the-art single-object methods on both datasets. Finally, we evaluate performance quantitatively on multiple object reconstruction with synthetic scenes assembled from ShapeNet objects. \"",

Our model concerns Collaborative Ternary Relations (CoTeRe), where the ternary relation involves channel (C, for implicit), temporal (T, for implicit), and spatial (S, for explicit) relation (R). We devise a flexible and effective CTSR module to collaborate ternary relations for 3D-CNNs, and then construct CoTeRe-Nets for action recognition. Extensive experiments on both ablation study and performance evaluation demonstrate that our CTSR module is significantly effective with approximate 3% gains and our CoTeRe-Nets outperform state-of-the-art approaches on three popular benchmarks. Boosts analysis and relations visualization also validate that relations of both implicit and explicit cues are discovered with efficacy by our method.

To this end, we propose a self-coordinate knowledge amalgamation network (SOKA-Net) for learning the multi-talent student model. This is achieved via a dual-step adaptive competitive-cooperation training approach, where the knowledge of the heterogeneous teachers are in the first step amalgamated to guide the shared parameter learning of the student network, and followed by a gradient-based competition-balancing strategy to learn the multi-head prediction network as well as the loss weightings of the distinct tasks in the second step. The two steps, which we term as the collaboration and competition step respectively, are performed alternatively until the balance of the competition is reached for the ultimate collaboration. Experimental results demonstrate that, the learned student not only comes with a smaller size but all achieves performances on par with or even superior to those of the teachers.\"",

In addition, a novel multi-order feature analysis method is introduced which learns posture and multi-order motion information from the intermediate feature maps of videos effectively and efficiently. Due to the exploitation of joint-aware features in common, the proposed technique is capable of learning gesture recognition and 3D hand pose estimation even when only gesture or pose labels are available, and this enables weakly supervised network learning with much reduced data labeling efforts. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method achieves superior gesture recognition and 3D hand pose estimation performance as compared with the state-of-the-art.

Pre-trained detectors applied to unlabeled dataset always suffer from the difference of dataset distribution, also called domain shift. Domain adaptation for object detection tries to adapt the detector from labeled datasets to unlabeled ones for better performance. In this paper, we are the first to reveal that the region proposal network (RPN) and region proposal classifier (RPC) in the endemic two-stage detectors (e.g., Faster RCNN) demonstrate significantly different transferability when facing large domain gap. The region classifier shows preferable performance but is limited without RPN's high-quality proposals while simple alignment in the backbone network is not effective enough for RPN adaptation. We delve into the consistency and the difference of RPN and RPC, treat them individually and leverage high-confidence output of one as mutual guidance to train the other. Moreover, the samples with low-confidence are used for discrepancy calculation between RPN and RPC and minimax optimization. Extensive experimental results on various scenarios have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method in both domain-adaptive region proposal generation and object detection.

Our CFBI implicitly imposes the feature embedding from the target foreground object and its corresponding background to be contrastive, promoting the segmentation results accordingly.

        "abstract": "Vision perception is one of the most important components for a computer or robot to understand the surrounding scene and achieve autonomous applications. However, most of the vision models are based on the RGB sensors, which in general are vulnerable to the insufficient lighting condition. In contrast, the depth camera, another widely-used visual sensor, is capable of perceiving 3D information and being more robust to the lack of illumination, but unable to obtain appearance details of the surrounding environment compared to RGB cameras. To make RGB-based vision models workable for the low-lighting scenario, prior methods focus on learning the colorization on depth maps captured by depth cameras, such that the vision models can still achieve reasonable performance on colorized depth maps. However, the colorization produced in this manner is usually unrealistic and constrained to the specific vision model, thus being hard to generalize for other tasks to use. In this paper, we propose a depth map colorization method via disentangling appearance and structure factors, so that our model could 1) learn depth-invariant appearance features from an appearance reference and 2) generate colorized images by combining a given depth map and the appearance feature obtained from any reference. We conduct extensive experiments to show that our colorization results are more realistic and diverse in comparison to several image translation baselines.\"",

However, they can only produce static surfaces that are not controllable, which provides limited ability to modify the resulting model by editing its pose or shape parameters. Nevertheless, such features are essential in building flexible models for both computer graphics and computer vision. In this work, we present methodology that combines detail-rich implicit functions and parametric representations in order to reconstruct 3D models of people that remain controllable and accurate even in the presence of clothing. Given sparse 3D point clouds sampled on the surface of a dressed person, we use an Implicit Part Network (IP-Net) to jointly predict the outer 3D surface of the dressed person, the inner body surface, and the semantic correspondences to a parametric body model. We subsequently use correspondences to fit the body model to our inner surface and then non-rigidly deform it (under a parametric body + displacement model) to the outer surface in order to capture garment, face and hair detail. In quantitative and qualitative experiments with both full body data and hand scans we show that the proposed methodology generalizes, and is effective even given incomplete point clouds collected from single-view depth images.

We propose to learn the underlying class-agnostic commonalities that can be generalized from mask-annotated categories to novel categories. Specifically, we parse two types of commonalities: 1) shape commonalities which are learned by performing supervised learning on instance boundary prediction; and 2) appearance commonalities which are captured by modeling pairwise affinities among pixels of feature maps to optimize the separability between instance and the background. Incorporating both the shape and appearance commonalities, our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both partially supervised setting and few-shot setting for instance segmentation on COCO dataset.

        "abstract": "A wide range of image captioning models has been developed, achieving significant improvement based on popular metrics, such as BLEU, CIDEr, and SPICE. However, although the generated captions can accurately describe the image, they are generic for similar images and lack distinctiveness, i.e., cannot properly describe the uniqueness of each image. In this paper, we aim to improve the distinctiveness of image captions through training with sets of similar images. First, we propose a distinctiveness metric --- between-set CIDEr (CIDErBtw) to evaluate the distinctiveness of a caption with respect to those of similar images. Our metric shows that the human annotations of each image are not equivalent based on distinctiveness. Thus we propose several new training strategies to encourage the distinctiveness of the generated caption for each image, which are based on using CIDErBtw in a weighted loss function or as a reinforcement learning reward. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted, showing that our proposed approach significantly improves both distinctiveness (as measured by CIDErBtw and retrieval metrics) and accuracy (e.g., as measured by CIDEr) for a wide variety of image captioning baselines. These results are further confirmed through a user study.\"",

DRealSR establishes a new SR benchmark with diverse real-world degradation processes, mitigating the limitations of conventional simulated image degradation. In general, the targets of SR vary with image regions with different low-level image components, e.g., smoothness preserving for flat regions, sharpening for edges, and detail enhancing for textures. Learning an SR model with conventional pixel-wise loss usually is easily dominated by flat regions and edges, and fails to infer realistic details of complex textures. We propose a Component Divide-and-Conquer (CDC) model and a Gradient-Weighted (GW) loss for SR. Our CDC parses an image with three components, employs three Component-Attentive Blocks (CABs) to learn attentive masks and intermediate SR predictions with an intermediate supervision learning strategy, and trains an SR model following a divide-and-conquer learning principle. Our GW loss also provides a feasible way to balance the difficulties of image components for SR. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our CDC and the challenging aspects of our DRealSR dataset related to diverse real-world scenarios.

In contrast, we propose to solve instance segmentation from a new perspective. Instead of using instance-wise ROIs as inputs to a network of fixed weights, we employ dynamic instance-aware networks, conditioned on instances. CondInst enjoys two advantages: 1) Instance segmentation is solved by a fully convolutional network, eliminating the need for ROI cropping and feature alignment. 2) Due to the much improved capacity of dynamically-generated conditional convolutions, the mask head can be very compact (e.g., 3 conv. layers, each having only 8 channels), leading to significantly faster inference. We demonstrate a simpler instance segmentation method that can achieve improved performance in both accuracy and inference speed.

We first show that a simple architecture modeling the entropy between the image latent codes is as competitive as other neural video compression works and video codecs while being much faster and easier to implement. We then propose a novel internal learning extension on top of this architecture that brings an additional 10% bitrate savings without trading off decoding speed. Importantly, we show that our approach outperforms H.265 and other deep learning baselines in MS-SSIM on higher bitrate UVG video, and against all video codecs on lower framerates, while being thousands of times faster in decoding than deep models utilizing an autoregressive entropy model. \"",

The usage of human language is the rose among horns for this purpose, because the language is friendly to users but poses great difficulties for the model in associating relevant words with the semantically ambiguous regions. To resolve this issue, we propose a delicate mechanism which bridges the semantic chasm between the language input and the generated visual content. The state-of-the-art image compositing techniques pose a latent ceiling of fidelity for the composited content during the adversarial training process. In this work, we improve the compositing by breaking through the latent ceiling using a novel piecewise value function.

        "abstract": "Photo retouching aims at enhancing the aesthetic visual quality of images that suffer from photographic defects such as over/under exposure, poor contrast, inharmonious saturation. Practically, photo retouching can be accomplished by a series of image processing operations. In this paper, we investigate some commonly-used retouching operations and mathematically find that these pixel-independent operations can be approximated or formulated by multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Based on this analysis, we propose an extremely light-weight framework - Conditional Sequential Retouching Network (CSRNet) - for efficient global image retouching. CSRNet consists of a base network and a condition network. The base network acts like an MLP that processes each pixel independently and the condition network extracts the global features of the input image to generate a condition vector. To realize retouching operations, we modulate the intermediate features using Global Feature Modulation (GFM), of which the parameters are transformed by condition vector. Benefiting from the utilization of $1 imes1$ convolution, CSRNet only contains less than 37k trainable parameters, which is orders of magnitude smaller than existing learning-based methods. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset quantitively and qualitatively.

In brief, our approach builds a set of autoencoders, one for each object class, appropriately trained so as to output a discrepancy between the input and output if a perturbation was added to the sample and trigger context violation.

        "abstract": "Image-text matching plays a central role in bridging vision and language. Most existing approaches only rely on the image-text instance pair to learn their representations, thereby exploiting their matching relationships and making the corresponding alignments. Such approaches only exploit the superficial associations contained in the instance pairwise data, with no consideration of any external commonsense knowledge, which may hinder their capabilities to reason the higher-level relationships between image and text. In this paper, we propose a Consensus-aware Visual-Semantic Embedding (CVSE) model to incorporate the consensus information, namely the commonsense knowledge shared between both modalities, into image-text matching. Specifically, the consensus information is exploited by computing the statistical co-occurrence correlations between the semantic concepts from the image captioning corpus and deploying the constructed concept correlation graph to yield the consensus-aware concept (CAC) representations. Afterwards, CVSE learns the associations and alignments between image and text based on the exploited consensus as well as the instance-level representations for both modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets verify that the exploited consensus makes significant contributions to constructing more meaningful visual-semantic embeddings, with the superior performances over the state-of-the-art approaches on the bidirectional image and text retrieval task.

The model takes two temporal stereo pairs as input, and predicts disparity and scene flow. The model self-adapts at test time by iteratively refining its predictions. The refinement process is guided by a consistency loss, which combines stereo and temporal photo-consistency with a geometric term that couples disparity and 3D motion. To handle inherent modeling error in the consistency loss (e.g. Lambertian assumptions) and for better generalization, we further introduce a learned, output refinement network, which takes the initial predictions, the loss, and the gradient as input, and efficiently predicts a correlated output update. In multiple experiments, including ablation studies, we show that the proposed model can reliably predict disparity and scene flow in challenging imagery, achieves better generalization than the state-of-the-art, and adapts quickly and robustly to unseen domains. \"",

Here, we propose to unify unlabeled sample selection and model training towards minimizing labeling cost, and make two contributions towards that end. First, we exploit both labeled and unlabeled data using semi-supervised learning (SSL) to distill information from unlabeled data during the training stage. Second, we propose a consistency-based sample selection metric that is coherent with the training objective such that the selected samples are effective at improving model performance. We conduct extensive experiments on image classification tasks. The experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method with limited labeled data, compared to the existing methods and the alternative AL and SSL combinations. Additionally, we also study an important yet under-explored problem -- ``When can we start learning-based AL selection?\"\".

In this paper, we present a physics-based method for inferring 3D human motion from video sequences that takes initial 2D and 3D pose estimates as input. We first estimate ground contact timings with a novel prediction network which is trained without hand-labeled data. A physics-based trajectory optimization then solves for a physically-plausible motion, based on the inputs. We show this process produces motions that are significantly more realistic than those from purely kinematic methods, substantially improving quantitative measures of both kinematic and dynamic plausibility. We demonstrate our method on character animation and pose estimation tasks on dynamic motions of dancing and sports with complex contact patterns.\"",

However, previous works suffer from error propagation, which stems from the accumulation of reconstructed error in inter predictive coding. Meanwhile, previous learning based video codecs are also not adaptive to different video contents. To address these two problems, we propose a content adaptive and error propagation aware video compression system. Specifically, our method employs a joint training strategy by considering the compression performance of multiple consecutive frames instead of a single frame. Based on the learned long-term temporal information, our approach effectively alleviates error propagation in reconstructed frames. More importantly, instead of using the hand-crafted coding modes in the traditional compression systems, we design an online encoder updating scheme for the learned video compression. The proposed approach updates the parameters for encoder according to the rate-distortion criterion but keeps the decoder unchanged in the inference stage. Therefore, the encoder is adaptive to different video contents and achieves better compression efficiency by reducing the domain gap between the training and testing datasets. Our method is simple yet effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art learning based video codec on benchmark datasets without increasing the model size or decreasing the decoding speed.\"",

It is usually done by extracting and matching sparse feature points, which are error-prone in low-light and low-texture images. On the other hand, previous deep homography approaches use either synthetic images for supervised learning or aerial images for unsupervised learning, both ignoring the importance of handling depth disparities and moving objects in real world applications. To overcome these problems, in this work we propose an unsupervised deep homography method with a new architecture design. In the spirit of the RANSAC procedure in traditional methods, we specifically learn an outlier mask to only select reliable regions for homography estimation. We calculate loss with respect to our learned deep features instead of directly comparing image content as did previously. To achieve the unsupervised training, we also formulate a novel triplet loss customized for our network. We verify our method by conducting comprehensive comparisons on a new dataset that covers a wide range of scenes with varying degrees of difficulties for the task. Experimental results reveal that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art including deep solutions and feature-based solutions.\"",

Different from most previous explorations that often aim at developing adversarial-based domain alignment solutions, we tackle this challenging task from a new perspective, mph{i.e.}, content-consistent matching (CCM). The target of CCM is to acquire those synthetic images that share similar distribution with the real ones in the target domain, so that the domain gap can be naturally alleviated by employing the content-consistent synthetic images for training. To be specific, we facilitate the CCM from two aspects, mph{i.e.}, semantic layout matching and pixel-wise similarity matching. First, we use all the synthetic images from the source domain to train an initial segmentation model, which is then employed to produce coarse pixel-level labels for the unlabeled images in the target domain. With the coarse/accurate label maps for real/synthetic images, we construct their semantic layout matrixes from both horizontal and vertical directions and perform the matrixes matching to find out the synthetic images with similar semantic layout to real images. Second, we choose those predicted labels with high confidence to generate feature embeddings for all classes in the target domain, and further perform the pixel-wise matching on the mined layout-consistent synthetic images to harvest the appearance-consistent pixels. With the proposed CCM, only those content-consistent synthetic images are taken into account for learning the segmentation model, which can effectively alleviate the domain bias caused by those content-irrelevant synthetic images. Extensive experiments are conducted on two popular domain adaptation tasks, mph{i.e.}, GTA5$\\xrightarrow{}$Cityscapes and SYNTHIA$\\xrightarrow{}$Cityscapes. Our CCM yields consistent improvements over the baselines and performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts.\"",

In this work, we first empirically find the recognition accuracy is highly correlated with the bounding box size of an actor, and thus higher resolution of actors contributes to better performance. However, video models require dense sampling in time to achieve accurate recognition. To fit in GPU memory, the frames to backbone network must be kept low-resolution, resulting in a coarse feature map in RoI-Pooling layer. Thus, we revisit RCNN for actor-centric action recognition via cropping and resizing image patches around actors before feature extraction with I3D deep network. Moreover, we found that expanding actor bounding boxes slightly and fusing the context features can further boost the performance. Consequently, we develop a surpringly effective baseline (Context-Aware RCNN) and it achieves new state-of-the-art results on two challenging action detection benchmarks of AVA and JHMDB. Our observations challenge the conventional wisdom of RoI-Pooling based pipeline and encourage researchers rethink the importance of resolution in actor-centric action recognition. Our approach can serve as a strong baseline for video action detection and is expected to inspire new ideas for this filed. The code is available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/CRCNN-Action. \"",

Many efforts have been recently devoted to complementing CNNs with the global modeling ability, especially by a family of works on global feature interaction. In these works, the global context information is incorporated into local features before they are fed into convolutional layers. However, research on neuroscience reveals that the neurons' ability of modifying their functions dynamically according to context is essential for the perceptual tasks, which has been overlooked in most of CNNs. Motivated by this, we propose one novel Context-Gated Convolution (CGC) to explicitly modify the weights of convolutional layers adaptively under the guidance of global context. As such, being aware of the global context, the modulated convolution kernel of our proposed CGC can better extract representative local patterns and compose discriminative features. Moreover, our proposed CGC is lightweight and applicable with modern CNN architectures, and consistently improves the performance of CNNs according to extensive experiments on image classification, action recognition, and machine translation.

        "abstract": "Requirement of large annotated datasets restricts the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for many practical applications. The problem can be mitigated by using active learning (AL) techniques which, under a given annotation budget, allow to select a subset of data that yields maximum accuracy upon fine tuning. State of the art AL approaches typically relies on measures of visual diversity or prediction uncertainty, which are unable to effectively capture the variations in the spatial context. On the other hand, modern CNN architectures make heavy use of spatial context for achieving highly accurate predictions. Since the context is difficult to evaluate in the absence of ground-truth labels, we introduce the notion of contextual diversity that captures the confusion associated with spatially co-occurring classes. Contextual Diversity (CD) hinges on a crucial observation that the probability vector predicted by a CNN for a region of interest typically contains information from a larger receptive field. Exploiting this observation, we use the proposed CD measure within two AL frameworks: (1) a core-set based strategy and (2) a reinforcement learning based policy, for the active frame selection. Our extensive empirical evaluation establishes state of the art results for active learning on benchmark datasets of Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection and Image classification. Our ablation studies show clear advantages of using contextual diversity for active learning.\"",

However, most existing works address the domain discrepancy by aligning the data distributions of two domains at a global image level whereas the local consistencies are largely neglected. This paper presents an innovative local contextual-relation consistent domain adaptation (CrCDA) technique that aims to achieve local-level consistencies during the global-level alignment. The idea is to take a closer look at region-wise feature representations and align them for local-level consistencies. Specifically, CrCDA learns and enforces the prototypical local contextual-relations explicitly in the feature space of a labelled source domain while transferring them to an unlabelled target domain via backpropagation-based adversarial learning. An adaptive entropy max-min adversarial learning scheme is designed to optimally align these hundreds of local contextual-relations across domain without requiring discriminator or extra computation overhead. The proposed CrCDA has been evaluated extensively over two challenging domain adaptive segmentation tasks (e.g., GTA5 to Cityscapes and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes), and experiments demonstrate its superior segmentation performance as compared with state-of-the-art methods.\"",

        "abstract": "Phrase grounding, the problem of associating image regions to caption words, is a crucial component of vision-language tasks. We show that phrase grounding can be learned by optimizing word-region attention to maximize a lower bound on mutual information between images and caption words. Given pairs of images and captions, we maximize compatibility of the attention-weighted regions and the words in the corresponding caption, compared to non-corresponding pairs of images and captions. A key idea is to construct effective negative captions for learning through language model guided word substitutions. Training with our negatives yields a $\\sim10\\%$ absolute gain in accuracy over randomly-sampled negatives from the training data. Our weakly supervised phrase grounding model trained on COCO-Captions shows a healthy gain of $5.7\\%$ to achieve $76.7\\%$ accuracy on Flickr30K Entities benchmark.

Each view is noisy and incomplete, but important factors, such as physics, geometry, and semantics, tend to be shared between all views (e.g., a ``dog\"\" can be seen, heard, and felt). We investigate the classic hypothesis that a powerful representation is one that models view-invariant factors. We study this hypothesis under the framework of multiview contrastive learning, where we learn a representation that aims to maximize mutual information between different views of the same scene but is otherwise compact. Our approach scales to any number of views, and is view-agnostic. We analyze key properties of the approach that make it work, finding that the contrastive loss outperforms a popular alternative based on cross-view prediction, and that the more views we learn from, the better the resulting representation captures underlying scene semantics.\"",

While demonstrating promising results, most implicit approaches are limited to comparably simple geometry of single objects and do not scale to more complicated or large-scale scenes. The key limiting factor of implicit methods is their simple fully-connected network architecture which does not allow for integrating local information in the observations or incorporating inductive biases such as translational equivariance. In this paper, we propose Convolutional Occupancy Networks, a more flexible implicit representation for detailed reconstruction of objects and 3D scenes. By combining convolutional encoders with implicit occupancy decoders, our model incorporates inductive biases, enabling structured reasoning in 3D space. We investigate the effectiveness of the proposed representation by reconstructing complex geometry from noisy point clouds and low-resolution voxel representations. We empirically find that our method enables the fine-grained implicit 3D reconstruction of single objects, scales to large indoor scenes, and generalizes well from synthetic to real data.\"",

To address these issues, we propose a NOVEL pixel translation framework called mph{Cooperative GAN (CooGAN)} for HR facial image editing. This framework features a local path for fine-grained local facial patch generation (\\ie, patch-level HR, LOW memory) and a global path for global low-resolution (LR) facial structure monitoring (\\ie, image-level LR, LOW memory), which largely reduce memory requirements. Both paths work in a cooperative manner under a local-to-global consistency objective (\\ie, for smooth stitching). In addition, we propose a lighter selective transfer unit for more efficient multi-scale features fusion, yielding higher fidelity facial attributes manipulation. Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ well demonstrate the memory efficiency as well as the high image generation quality of the proposed framework. \\keywords{Generative Adversarial Networks, Conditional GANs, Face Attributes Editing\"",

This paper proposes a novel anchor-free, two-stage framework which first extracts a number of object proposals by finding potential corner keypoint combinations and then assigns a class label to each proposal by a standalone classification stage. We demonstrate that these two stages are effective solutions for improving recall and precision, respectively, and they can be integrated into an end-to-end network. Our approach, dubbed Corner Proposal Network (CPN), enjoys the ability to detect objects of various scales and also avoids being confused by a large number of false-positive proposals. On the MS-COCO dataset, CPN achieves an AP of 49.2% which is competitive among state-of-the-art object detection methods. CPN also fits the scenario of computational efficiency, which achieves an AP of 41.6%/39.7% at 26.2/43.3 FPS, surpassing most competitors with the same inference speed.

First, we present a single-view single-object 6D pose estimation method, which we use to generate 6D object pose hypotheses. Second, we develop a robust method for matching individual 6D object pose hypotheses across different input images in order to jointly estimate camera viewpoints and 6D poses of all objects in a single consistent scene. Our approach explicitly handles object symmetries, does not require depth measurements, is robust to missing or incorrect object hypotheses, and automatically recovers the number of objects in the scene. Third, we develop a method for global scene refinement given multiple object hypotheses and their correspondences across views. This is achieved by solving an object-level bundle adjustment problem that refines the poses of cameras and objects to minimize the reprojection error in all views. We demonstrate that the proposed method, dubbed Cosy-Pose, outperforms current state-of-the-art results for single-view and multi-view 6D object pose estimation by a large margin on two challenging benchmarks: the YCB-Video and T-LESS datasets.

We introduce a count-weighted detection loss function that assigns higher weights to the detection errors occurring at highly overlapping pedestrians. The proposed loss function is utilized at both stages of the two-stage detector.

One of the problems of the VLN task is data scarcity since it is difficult to collect enough navigation paths with human-annotated instructions for interactive environments. In this paper, we explore the use of counterfactual thinking as a human-inspired data augmentation method that results in robust models. Counterfactual thinking is a concept that describes the human propensity to create possible alternatives to life events that have already occurred. We propose an adversarial-driven counterfactual reasoning model that can consider effective conditions instead of low-quality augmented data. In particular, we present a model-agnostic adversarial path sampler (APS) that learns to sample challenging paths that force the navigator to improve based on the navigation performance. APS also serves to do pre-exploration of unseen environments to strengthen the model's ability to generalize. We evaluate the influence of APS on the performance of different VLN baseline models using the room-to-room dataset (R2R). The results show that the adversarial training process with our proposed APS benefits VLN models under both seen and unseen environments. And the pre-exploration process can further gain additional improvements under unseen environments.\"",

We make these two representations synergistic by introducing novel consistency losses that ensure that the surface created from the atlas aligns with the level-set of the implicit function. Our hybrid architecture outputs results which are superior to the output of the two equivalent single-representation networks, yielding smoother explicit surfaces with more accurate normals, and a more accurate implicit occupancy function.

CUCaNet is capable of adaptively learning spectral and spatial response functions from HS-MS correspondences by enforcing reasonable consistency assumptions on the networks. Moreover, a cross-attention module is devised to yield more effective spectral-spatial information transfer in networks.

However, most existing methods focus on transfer of style and appearance, rather than on shape translation. The latter task is challenging, due to its intricate non-local nature, which calls for additional supervision. We mitigate this by descending the deep layers of a pre-trained network, where the deep features contain more semantics, and applying the translation between these deep features. Our translation is performed in a cascaded, deep-to-shallow, fashion, along the deep feature hierarchy: we first translate between the deepest layers that encode the higher-level semantic content of the image, proceeding to translate the shallower layers, conditioned on the deeper ones. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of using pre-trained deep features in the context of unconditioned image generation. \"",

Given a source image(s) and a driving video, our networks animate the subject in the source images according to the motion in the driving video. In our attention mechanism, dense similarities between the learned keypoints in the source and the driving images are computed in order to retrieve the appearance information from the source images. Taking a different approach from the well-studied warping based models, our attention-based model has several advantages. By reassembling non-locally searched pieces from the source contents, our approach can produce more realistic outputs. Furthermore, our system can make use of multiple observations of the source appearance (e.g. front and sides of faces) to make the results more accurate. To reduce the training-testing discrepancy of the self-supervised learning, a novel cross-identity training scheme is additionally introduced. With the training scheme, our networks is trained to transfer motions between different subjects, as in the real testing scenario. Experimental results validate that our method produces visually pleasing results in various object domains, showing better performances compared to previous works.\"",

These modules use Depth-to-RGB Weighing (DW) and RGB-to-RGB Weighting (RW) to allow rich cross-modal and cross-scale interactions among feature layers generated by different network blocks. To effectively train the proposed Cross-Modal Weighting Network (CMWNet), we design a composite loss function that summarizes the errors between intermediate predictions and ground truth over different scales. With all these novel components working together, CMWNet effectively fuses information from RGB and depth channels, and meanwhile explores object localization and details across scales. Thorough evaluations demonstrate CMWNet consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods on seven popular benchmarks.\"",

Inspired by how humans learn, Curriculum DeepSDF organizes the learning task in ascending order of difficulty according to the following two criteria: surface accuracy and sample difficulty. The former considers stringency in supervising with ground truth, while the latter regards the weights of hard training samples near complex geometry and fine structure. More specifically, Curriculum DeepSDF learns to reconstruct coarse shapes at first, and then gradually increases the accuracy and focuses more on complex local details. Experimental results show that a carefully-designed curriculum leads to significantly better shape reconstructions with the same training data, training epochs and network architecture as DeepSDF.

The curriculum manager, an independent network module, constantly updates the curriculum during training and iteratively learns which domains or samples are best suited for aligning to the target. The intuition behind is to force the curriculum manager to constantly re-measure the tranferability of latent domains over time to adversarially raise the error rate of the domain discriminator. CMSS does not require any knowledge of the domain labels yet it outperforms other methods on four well-known benchmarks by significant margins.

        "abstract": "We address the curve lane detection problem which poses more real-world challenges than conventional lane detection for better facilitating modern assisted/autonomous driving systems. Current hand-designed lane detection methods are not robust enough to capture the curve lanes especially the remote ones due to the lack of modeling both long-range contextual information and detailed curve trajectory. In this paper, we propose a novel lane-sensitive architecture search framework named CurveLane-NAS to automatically capture both long-ranged coherent and accurate short-range curve information while unifying both architecture search and post-processing on curve lane predictions via point blending. It consists of three search modules: a) a feature fusion search module to find a better fusion of the local and global context for multi-level hierarchy features; b) an elastic backbone search module to explore an efficient feature extractor with good semantics and latency; c) an adaptive point blending module to search a multi-level post-processing refinement strategy to combine multi-level head prediction. The unified framework ensures lane-sensitive predictions by the mutual guidance between NAS and adaptive point blending. Furthermore, we also steer forward to release a more challenging benchmark named CurveLanes for addressing the most difficult curve lanes. It consists of 150K images with 680K labels. Experiments on the new CurveLanes show that the SOTA lane detection methods suffer substantial performance drop while our model can still reach an 80+% F1-score. Extensive experiments on traditional lane benchmarks such as CULane also demonstrate the superiority of our CurveLane-NAS, e.g. achieving a new SOTA result 74.8% of F1-score on CULane dataset.\"",

We introduce a different unsupervised method that allows us to learn pedestrian embeddings from raw videos, without resorting to pseudo labels. The goal is to construct a self-supervised pretext task that matches the person re-ID objective. Inspired by the mph{data association} concept in multi-object tracking, we propose the extbf{Cyc}le extbf{As}sociation ( extbf{CycAs}) task: after performing data association between a pair of video frames forward and then backward, a pedestrian instance is supposed to be associated to itself. To fulfill this goal, the model must learn a meaningful representation that can well describe correspondences between instances in frame pairs. We adapt the discrete association process to a differentiable form, such that end-to-end training becomes feasible. Experiments are conducted in two aspects: We first compare our method with existing unsupervised re-ID methods on seven benchmarks and demonstrate CycAs' superiority. Then, to further validate the practical value of CycAs in real-world applications, we perform training on self-collected videos and report promising performance on the standard test sets.\"",

        "abstract": "Efficient search is a core issue in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). It is difficult for conventional NAS algorithms to directly search the architectures on large-scale tasks like ImageNet. In general, the cost of GPU hours for NAS grows with regard to training dataset size and candidate set size. One common way is searching on a smaller proxy dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10) and then transferring to the target task (e.g., ImageNet). These architectures optimized on proxy data are not guaranteed to be optimal on the target task. Another common way is learning with a smaller candidate set, which may require expert knowledge and indeed betrays the essence of NAS. In this paper, we present DA-NAS that can directly search the architecture for large-scale target tasks while allowing a large candidate set in a more efficient manner. Our method is based on an interesting observation that the learning speed for blocks in deep neural networks is related to the difficulty of recognizing distinct categories. We carefully design a progressive data adapted pruning strategy for efficient architecture search. It will quickly trim low performed blocks on a subset of target dataset) and then gradually find the best blocks on the whole target dataset. At this time, the original candidate set becomes as compact as possible, providing a faster search in the target task. Experiments on ImageNet verify the effectiveness of our approach. It is $ extbf{2}oldsymbol{ imes}$ faster than previous methods while the accuracy is currently state-of-the-art, at $ extbf{76.2%}$ under small FLOPs constraint. It supports an argument search space (i.e., more candidate blocks) to efficiently search the best-performing architecture.\"",

Conventional approaches to the visual localization problem rely on handcrafted features or human-made objects on the road.

In this work, we seek to exploit the deep attention mechanism to search for salient, distinctive and stable features that are good for long-term matching in the scene through a novel end-to-end deep neural network. Furthermore, our learned feature descriptors are demonstrated to be competent to establish robust matches and therefore successfully estimate the optimal camera poses with high precision. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness of our method using a freshly collected dataset with high-quality ground truth trajectories and hardware synchronization between sensors. Results demonstrate that our method achieves a competitive localization accuracy when compared to the LiDAR-based localization solutions under various challenging circumstances, leading to a potential low-cost localization solution for autonomous driving.\"",

The pioneering AutoAugment automated the search for optimal DA policies with reinforcement learning. However, AutoAugment is extremely computationally expensive, limiting its wide applicability. Followup works such as Population Based Augmentation (PBA) and Fast AutoAugment improved efficiency, but their optimization speed remains a bottleneck. In this paper, we propose Differentiable Automatic Data Augmentation (DADA) which dramatically reduces the cost. DADA relaxes the discrete DA policy selection to a differentiable optimization problem via Gumbel-Softmax. In addition, we introduce an unbiased gradient estimator, RELAX, leading to an efficient and effective one-pass optimization strategy to learn an efficient and accurate DA policy. We conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of Auto DA in pre-training for downstream detection problems. Results show our DADA is at least one order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art while achieving very comparable accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/VDIGPKU/DADA.\"",

Distinct from cost volume approaches, we propose an efficient depth estimation approach by first (a) detecting and evaluating descriptors for interest points, then (b) learning to match and triangulate a small set of interest points, and finally densifying this sparse set of 3D points using CNNs. An end-to-end network efficiently performs all three steps within a deep learning framework and trained with intermediate 2D image and 3D geometric supervision, along with depth supervision. Crucially, our first step complements pose estimation using interest point detection and descriptor learning. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on depth estimation with lower compute for different scene lengths. Furthermore, our method generalizes to newer environments and the descriptors output by our network compare favorably to strong baselines. \"",

The embedded deformation layer (EDL) is a differentiable deformable geometric proxy which explicitly models point displacements of non-rigid deformations in a lower dimensional space and serves as a local rigidity regularizer. DEMEA decouples the parameterization of the deformation from the final mesh resolution since the deformation is defined over a lower dimensional embedded deformation graph. We perform a large-scale study on four different datasets of deformable objects. Reasoning about the local rigidity of meshes using EDL allows us to achieve higher-quality results for highly deformable objects, compared to directly regressing vertex positions. We demonstrate multiple applications of DEMEA, including non-rigid 3D reconstruction from depth and shading cues, non-rigid surface tracking, as well as the transfer of deformations over different meshes.\"",

        "abstract": "Deep generative models are often used for human motion prediction as they are able to model multi-modal data distributions and characterize diverse human behavior. While much care has been taken into designing and learning deep generative models, how to efficiently produce diverse samples from a deep generative model after it has been trained is still an under-explored problem. To obtain samples from a pretrained generative model, most existing generative human motion prediction methods draw a set of independent Gaussian latent codes and convert them to motion samples. Clearly, this random sampling strategy is not guaranteed to produce diverse samples for two reasons: (1) The independent sampling cannot force the samples to be diverse; (2) The sampling is based solely on likelihood which may only produce samples that correspond to the major modes of the data distribution. To address these problems, we propose a novel sampling method, Diversifying Latent Flows (DLow), to produce a diverse set of samples from a pretrained deep generative model. Unlike random (independent) sampling, the proposed DLow sampling method samples a single random variable and then maps it with a set of learnable mapping functions to a set of correlated latent codes. The correlated latent codes are then decoded into a set of correlated samples. During training, DLow uses a diversity-promoting prior over samples as an objective to optimize the latent mappings to improve sample diversity. The design of the prior is highly flexible and can be customized to generate diverse motions with common features (e.g., similar leg motion but diverse upper-body motion). Our experiments demonstrate that DLow outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of sample diversity and accuracy.\"",

Achieving this level of details is key for a number of applications that require understanding the interactions of the people with each other or with the environment. The main challenge is the lack of in-the-wild data with labeled whole-body 3D poses. In previous work, training data has been annotated or generated for simpler tasks focusing on bodies, hands or faces separately. In this work, we propose to take advantage of these datasets to train independent experts for each part, namely a body, a hand and a face expert, and distill their knowledge into a single deep network designed for whole-body 2D-3D pose detection. In practice, given a training image with partial or no annotation, each part expert detects its subset of keypoints in 2D and 3D and the resulting estimations are combined to obtain whole-body pseudo ground-truth poses. A distillation loss encourages the whole-body predictions to mimic the experts' outputs. Our results show that this approach significantly outperforms the same whole-body model trained without distillation while staying close to the performance of the experts. Importantly, DOPE is computationally less demanding than the ensemble of experts and can achieve real-time performance.

The metric compares two 3D shapes by measuring distances between multi-view images differentiably rendered from the shapes. Importantly, the image-space distance is also differentiable and measures visual similarity, rather than pixel-wise distortion. Specifically, the similarity is defined by mean-squared errors over HardNet features computed from probabilistic keypoint maps of the compared images. Our differential visual shape similarity metric can be easily plugged into various 3D reconstruction networks, replacing their distortion-based losses, such as Chamfer or Earth Mover distances, so as to optimize the network weights to produce reconstructions with better structural fidelity and visual quality. We demonstrate this both objectively, using well-known shape metrics for retrieval and classification tasks that are independent from our new metric, and subjectively through a perceptual study.\"",

        "abstract": "Budgeted pruning is the problem of pruning under resource constraints. In budgeted pruning, how to distribute the resources across layers (i.e., sparsity allocation) is the key problem. Traditional methods solve it by discretely searching for the layer-wise pruning ratios, which lacks efficiency. In this paper, we propose Differentiable Sparsity Allocation (DSA), an efficient end-to-end budgeted pruning flow. Utilizing a novel differentiable pruning process, DSA finds the layer-wise pruning ratios with gradient-based optimization. It allocates sparsity in continuous space, which is more efficient than methods based on discrete evaluation and search. Furthermore, DSA could work in a pruning-from-scratch manner, whereas traditional budgeted pruning methods are applied to pre-trained models. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that DSA could achieve superior performance than current iterative budgeted pruning methods, and shorten the time cost of the overall pruning process by at least 1.5x in the meantime.\"",

The proposed DTVNet consists of two submodules: mph{Optical Flow Encoder} (OFE) and mph{Dynamic Video Generator} (DVG). The OFE maps a sequence of optical flow maps to a mph{normalized motion vector} that encodes the motion information inside the generated video. The DVG contains motion and content streams that learn from the motion vector and the single image respectively, as well as an encoder and a decoder to learn shared content features and construct video frames with corresponding motion respectively. Specifically, the mph{motion stream} introduces multiple mph{adaptive instance normalization} (AdaIN) layers to integrate multi-level motion information that are processed by linear layers. In the testing stage, videos with the same content but various motion information can be generated by different mph{normalized motion vectors} based on only one input image. We further conduct experiments on Sky Time-lapse dataset, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods for generating high-quality and dynamic videos, as well as the variety for generating videos with various motion information.\"",

        "abstract": "To get clear street-view and photo-realistic simulation in autonomous driving, we present an automatic video inpainting algorithm that can remove traffic agents from videos and synthesize missing regions with the guidance of depth/point cloud. By building a dense 3D map from stitched point clouds, frames within a video are geometrically correlated via this common 3D map. In order to fill a target inpainting area in a frame, it is straightforward to transform pixels from other frames into the current one with correct occlusion. Furthermore, we are able to fuse multiple videos through 3D point cloud registration, making it possible to inpaint a target video with multiple source videos. The motivation is to solve the long-time occlusion problem where an occluded area has never been visible in the entire video. This happens quite often for street view videos when there is a vehicle in the front. In this case, we can capture the scene a second time when the desired area becomes visible and do video fusion inpainting. To our knowledge, we are the first to fuse multiple videos for video inpainting. In order to evaluate our method, we collected 5 hour synchronized lidar and camera data from autonomous driving cars in the urban roads. To address long-time occlusion problems, we collect data for the same road in different days and times. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for all the criteria, especially the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) has been reduced by about %13.\"",

Achieving satisfactory region is essential to the success of these techniques. Motivated to assist diversiform region-based cartoon applications, we invite artists to annotate regions for in-the-wild cartoon images with several application-oriented goals: (1) To assist image-based cartoon rendering, relighting, and cartoon intrinsic decomposition literature, artists identify object outlines and eliminate lighting-and-shadow boundaries. (2) To assist cartoon inking tools, cartoon structure extraction applications, and cartoon texture processing techniques, artists clean-up texture or deformation patterns and emphasize cartoon structural boundary lines. (3) To assist region-based cartoon digitalization, clip-art vectorization, and animation tracking applications, artists inpaint and reconstruct broken or blurred regions in cartoon images. Given the typicality of these involved applications, this dataset is also likely to be used in other cartoon techniques. We detail the challenges in achieving this dataset and present a human-in-the-loop workflow namely Feasibility-based Assignment Recommendation (FAR) to enable large-scale annotating. The FAR tends to reduce artist trails-and-errors and encourage their enthusiasm during annotating. Finally, we present a dataset that contains a large number of artistic region compositions paired with corresponding cartoon illustrations. We also invite multiple professional artists to assure the quality of each annotation.\"",

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks are widely deployed on edge devices (g, for computer vision and speech recognition). Users either perform the inference locally (\\ie, edge-based) or send the data to the cloud and run inference remotely (\\ie, cloud-based). However, both solutions have their limitations: edge devices are heavily constrained by insufficient hardware resources and cannot afford to run large models; cloud servers, if not trustworthy, will raise serious privacy issues. In this paper, we mediate between the resource-constrained edge devices and the privacy-invasive cloud servers by introducing a novel extit{privacy-preserving edge-cloud inference} framework, \\method. We off-load the majority of the computations to the cloud and leverage a pair of mixing and de-mixing operation, inspired by mixup, to protect the privacy of the data transmitted to the cloud. Our framework has three advantages. First, it is extit{privacy-preserving} as the mixing cannot be inverted without the user's private mixing coefficients. Second, our framework is extit{accuracy-preserving} because our framework takes advantage of the space spanned by images, and we train the model in a mixing-aware manner to maintain accuracy. Third, our solution is extit{efficient} on the edge since the majority of the workload is delegated to the cloud, and our mixing and de-mixing processes introduce very few extra computations. Also, our framework introduces small communication overhead and maintains high hardware utilization on the cloud. Extensive experiments on multiple computer vision and speech recognition datasets demonstrate that our framework can greatly reduce the local computations on the edge (to fewer than 20% of FLOPs) with negligible loss of accuracy and no leakages of private information.\"",

Nevertheless, how to efficiently model the spatial-temporal skeleton graph without introducing extra computation burden is a challenging problem for industrial deployment. In this paper, we rethink the spatial aggregation in existing GCN-based skeleton action recognition methods and discover that they are limited by coupling aggregation mechanism. Inspired by the decoupling aggregation mechanism in CNNs, we propose decoupling GCN to boost the graph modeling ability with no extra computation, no extra latency, no extra GPU memory cost, and less than 10% extra parameters. Another prevalent problem of GCNs is over-fitting. Although dropout is a widely used regularization technique, it is not effective for GCNs, due to the fact that activation units are correlated between neighbor nodes. We propose DropGraph to discard features in correlated nodes, which is particularly effective on GCNs. Moreover, we introduce an attention-guided drop mechanism to enhance the regularization effect. All our contributions introduce zero extra computation burden at deployment. We conduct experiments on three datasets (NTU-RGBD, NTU-RGBD-120, and Northwestern-UCLA) and exceed the state-of-the-art performance with less computation cost.\"",

However, further adoption of the joint models are hindered: 1) the diversity of augmentation data is reduced limiting the further enhancement of segmentation, 2) misaligned regions in weakly supervised data disturb the training process, 3) lack of label-based region constraints in few-shot situation limits the registration performance. We propose a novel Deep Complementary Joint Model (DeepRS) for complex scene registration and few-shot segmentation. We embed a perturbation factor in the registration to increase the activity of deformation thus maintaining the augmentation data diversity. We take a pixel-wise discriminator to extract alignment confidence maps which highlight aligned regions in weakly supervised data so the misaligned regions' disturbance will be suppressed via weighting. The outputs from segmentation model are utilized to implement deep-based region constraints thus relieving the label requirements and bringing fine registration. Extensive experiments on the CT dataset of MM-WHS 2017 Challenge show great advantages of our DeepRS that outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models.\"",

Unlike existing methods that directly finetune the model in the target domain with pseudo labels generated by the source pre-trained model, our DCML method adaptively mines credible samples for training to avoid the misleading from noise labels. Specifically, we design two credibility metrics for sample mining including the k-Nearest Neighbor similarity for density evaluation and the prototype similarity for centrality evaluation.

The appropriate supervision and explicit calibration by the information of the physic model can enhance the neural network learning and its practical performance. In this paper, inspired by the geometry that data can be decomposed by two components from the null-space of the forward operator and the range space of its pseudo-inverse, we train neural networks to learn the two components and therefore learn the decomposition, i.e. we explicitly reformulate the neural network layers as learning range-nullspace decomposition functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We empirically show that the proposed framework demonstrates superior performance over recent deep residual learning, unrolled learning and nullspace learning on tasks including compressive sensing medical imaging and natural image super-resolution.

We propose to fill this gap by introducing DeepFashion3D, the largest collection to date of 3D garment models, with the goal of establishing a novel benchmark and dataset for the evaluation of image-based garment reconstruction systems. Deep Fashion3D contains 2078 models reconstructed from real garments, which covers 10 different categories and 563 garment instances. It provides rich annotations including 3D feature lines, 3D body pose and the corresponded multi-view real images. In addition, each garment is randomly posed to enhance the variety of real clothing deformations. To demonstrate the advantage of \\datasetName{}, we propose a novel baseline approach for single-view garment reconstruction, which leverages the merits of both mesh and implicit representations. A novel adaptable template is proposed to enable the learning of all types of clothing in a single network. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the proposed dataset to verify its significance and usefulness. We will make Deep Fashion3D publicly available upon publication. \"",

The key idea is to leverage the feedback signal provided by the forward process and learn an iterative update model. Specifically, in each iteration, the neural network takes the feedback as input and outputs an update on current estimation. Our approach does not have any restrictions on the forward process; it does not require any prior knowledge either. Through the feedback information, our model not only can produce accurate estimations that are coherent to the input observation but also is capable of recovering from early incorrect predictions. We verify the performance of our model over a wide range of inverse problems, including 6-DOF pose estimation, illumination estimation, as well as inverse kinematics. Comparing to traditional optimization-based methods, we can achieve comparable or better performance while being two to three orders of magnitude faster.

Although voxel-based convolutions are useful for feature aggregation, they produce ambiguous or wrong predictions if a voxel contains points from different classes.

But their high memory and computational costs (such as for neighborhood search and ball-querying) limit their ability and accuracy for large-scale point cloud processing. To address these issues, we propose a deep fusion network architecture (FusionNet) with a unique voxel-based ``mini-PointNet'' point cloud representation and a new feature aggregation module (fusion module) for large-scale 3D semantic segmentation. Our FusionNet can learn more accurate point-wise predictions when compared to voxel-based convolutional networks. It can realize more effective feature aggregations with lower memory and computational complexity for large-scale point cloud segmentation when compared to the popular point-wise convolutions.

On the contrary, we actively select a small quantity of informative samples for annotation to provide effective pairwise supervision so that discriminative hash codes can be obtained with limited annotation budget. Specifically, we generalize the structural risk minimization principle and obtain three criteria for the pairwise supervision acquisition: uncertainty, representativeness and diversity. Accordingly, samples involved in the following training pairs should be labeled: pairs with most uncertain similarity, pairs that minimize the discrepancy between labeled and unlabeled data, and pairs which are most different from the annotated data, so that the discriminality and generalization ability of the learned hash codes are significantly strengthened. Moreover, our DH-APS can also be employed as a plug-and-play module for semi-supervised hashing methods to further enhance the performance. Experiments demonstrate that the presented DH-APS achieves the accuracy of supervised hashing methods with only $30\\%$ labeled training samples and improves the semi-supervised binary codes by a sizable margin.\"",

Prior methods take line detection as a special case of object detection, while neglect the inherent characteristics of lines, leading to less efficient and suboptimal results. We propose a one-shot end-to-end framework by incorporating the classical Hough transform into deeply learned representations. By parameterizing lines with slopes and biases, we perform Hough transform to translate deep representations to the parametric space and then directly detect lines in the parametric space. More concretely, we aggregate features along candidate lines on the feature map plane and then assign the aggregated features to corresponding locations in the parametric domain. Consequently, the problem of detecting semantic lines in the spatial domain is transformed to spotting individual points in the parametric domain, making the post-processing steps, i.e. non-maximal suppression, more efficient. Furthermore, our method makes it easy to extract contextual line features, that are critical to accurate line detection. Experimental results on a public dataset demonstrate the advantages of our method over state-of-the-arts. Code and models will be publicly released.\"",

We add line priors through a trainable Hough transform block into a deep network. Hough transform provides the prior knowledge about global line parameterizations, while the convolutional layers can learn the local gradient-like line features.

In addition, the conventional methods rarely guarantee real-time pupil center detection in a general-purpose computer environment due to high complexity. Thus, we propose more accurate pupil center detection by improving the representation quality of the network in charge of pupil center detection. This is realized by representation learning based on mutual information. Also, the latency of the entire system is greatly reduced by using non-local block and self-attention block with large receptive field, which makes it accomplish real-time operation.

To address this problem we introduce Deep Local Shapes (DeepLS), a deep shape representation that enables high-quality 3D shape representation without prohibitive memory requirements. DeepLS replaces the dense volumetric signed distance function (SDF) representation used in traditional surface reconstruction systems with a learned continuous SDF defined by a neural network, inspired by recent work such as DeepSDF. Unlike DeepSDF, which represents an object-level SDF with a neural network and a single latent code, we store a grid of independent latent codes, each responsible for storing information about surfaces in a small local neighborhood. This decomposition of scenes into local shapes simplifies the prior distribution that the network must learn, and also enables efficient inference. %We enforce global shape consistency implicitly by fitting local shape codes from an receptive field that overlaps with neighboring voxels. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization power of DeepLS by showing object shape encoding and reconstructions of full scenes, where DeepLS delivers high compression, accuracy, and local shape completion.\"",

In this paper, we propose an approach that achieves decoupling of angular and spatial information by establishing correspondences in the angular domain, then employs regularization to enforce a rotational invariance. As opposed to relying on the Lambertian surface assumption, we align the angular domain by estimating sub-pixel displacements using the Fourier transform. The network takes sparse inputs, i.e. sub-views along particular directions, to gain structural information about the angular domain. A novel regularization technique further improves generalization by weight sharing and max-pooling among different directions. The proposed approach outperforms any previously reported method on multiple datasets. The accuracy gain over 2D images is improved by a factor of 1.5. Extensive ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the significance of each component.\"",

        "abstract": "We propose a new deep neural network which takes a colored 3D point cloud of a scene, and directly synthesizes a photo-realistic image from an arbitrary viewpoint. Key contributions of this work include a deep point feature extraction module, an image synthesis module, and an image refinement module. Our PointEncoder network extracts discriminative features from the point cloud that contain both local and global contextual information about the scene. Next, the multi-level point features are aggregated to form multi-layer feature maps. These are fed into our ImageDecoder network in order to generate a synthetic RGB image. Finally, the coarse output of the ImageDecoder network is refined using our RefineNet module, supplying more fine details and suppressing unwanted visual artifacts. To generate virtual camera viewpoints in the scene, we rotate and translate the 3D point cloud in order to synthesize new images from novel perspectives. We conduct numerous experiments on public datasets to validate our method, with respect to the quality of the synthesized views, and outperform state-of-the-art significantly.\"",

        "abstract": "Sketch-based image editing aims to synthesize and modify photos based on the structural information provided by the human-drawn sketches. Since sketches are difficult to collect, previous methods mainly use edge maps instead of sketches to train models (referred to as edge-based models). However, human-drawn sketches display great structural discrepancy with edge maps, thus failing edge-based models. Moreover, sketches often demonstrate huge variety among different users, demanding even higher generalizability and robustness for the editing model to work. In this paper, we propose Deep Plastic Surgery, a novel, robust and controllable image editing framework that allows users to interactively edit images using hand-drawn sketch inputs. We present a sketch refinement strategy, as inspired by the coarse-to-fine drawing process of the artists, which we show can help our model well adapt to casual and varied sketches without the need for real sketch training data. Our model further provides a refinement level control parameter that enables users to flexibly define how ``reliable'' the input sketch should be considered for the final output, balancing between sketch faithfulness and output verisimilitude (as the two goals might contradict if the input sketch is drawn poorly). To achieve the multi-level refinement, we introduce a style-based module for level conditioning, which allows adaptive feature representations for different levels in a singe network. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in improving the visual quality and user controllablity of image editing over the state-of-the-art methods. \"",

This allows us to optimize the scene volumes to minimize the error between their rendered images and the captured images. Our method is able to reconstruct real scenes with challenging non-Lambertian reflectance and complex geometry with occlusions and shadowing. Moreover, it accurately generalizes to novel viewpoints and lighting, including non-collocated lighting, rendering photorealistic images that are significantly better than state-of-the-art mesh-based methods.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of jointly upsampling videos both in space and time, which is becoming more important with advances in display systems. One solution for this is to run VSR and FI, one by one, independently. This is highly inefficient as heavy deep neural networks (DNN) are involved in each solution. To this end, we propose an end-to-end DNN framework for the space-time video upsampling by efficiently merging VSR and FI into a joint framework. In our framework, a novel weighting scheme is proposed to fuse input frames effectively without explicit motion compensation for efficient processing of videos. The results show better results both quantitatively and qualitatively, while reducing the computation time (x7 faster) and the number of parameters (30%) compared to baselines.

        "abstract": "Coded aperture is a promising approach for capturing the 4-D light field (LF), in which the 4-D data are compressively modulated into 2-D coded measurements that are further decoded by reconstruction algorithms. The bottleneck lies in the reconstruction algorithms, resulting in rather limited reconstruction quality. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel learning-based framework for the reconstruction of high-quality LFs from acquisitions via learned coded apertures. The proposed method incorporates the measurement observation into the deep learning framework elegantly to avoid relying entirely on data-driven priors for LF reconstruction. Specifically, we first formulate the compressive LF reconstruction as an inverse problem with an implicit regularization term. Then, we construct the regularization term with an efficient deep spatial-angular convolutional sub-network to comprehensively explore the signal distribution free from the limited representation ability and inefficiency of deterministic mathematical modeling. Experimental results show that the reconstructed LFs not only achieve much higher PSNR/SSIM but also preserve the LF parallax structure better, compared with state-of-the-art methods on both real and synthetic LF benchmarks. In addition, experiments show that our method is efficient and robust to noise, which is an essential advantage for a real camera system.

        "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising for enabling low-power event-driven data analytics. The best performing SNNs for image recognition tasks are obtained by converting a trained deep learning Analog Neural Network (ANN) composed of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation to SNN consisting of Integrate-and-Fire (IF) neurons with \"\"proper\"\" firing thresholds. However, this has come at the cost of accuracy loss and higher inference latency due to lack of a notion of time. In this work, we propose an ANN to SNN conversion methodology that uses a time-based coding scheme, named Temporal-Switch-Coding (TSC), and a corresponding TSC spiking neuron model. Each input image pixel is presented using two spikes and the timing between the two spiking instants is proportional to the pixel intensity. The real-valued ReLU activations in ANN are encoded using the spike-times of the TSC neurons in the converted TSC-SNN. At most two memory accesses and two addition operations are performed for each synapse during the whole inference, which significantly improves the SNN energy efficiency. We demonstrate the proposed TSC-SNN for VGG-16, ResNet-20 and ResNet-34 SNNs on datasets including CIFAR-10 (93.63% top-1), CIFAR-100 (70.97% top-1) and ImageNet (73.46% top-1 accuracy). It surpasses the best inference accuracy of the converted rate-encoded SNN with 7-14.5 times lesser inference latency, and 30-60 times fewer addition operations and memory accesses per inference across datasets.\"",

However, they assume distant (i.e., parallel) lights, which can in practical settings only be approximately realized, and they fail in near-light conditions. Near-light photometric stereo methods address near-light conditions but previous works are limited to over-simplified reflectances, such as Lambertian reflectance. The proposed method takes a hybrid approach of distant- and near-light models, where the surface normal of a small area (corresponding to a pixel) is computed locally with a distant light assumption, and the reconstruction error is assessed based on a near-light image formation model. This paper is the first work to solve unknown, spatially varying, diverse reflectances in near-light photometric stereo. \"",

We design a neural network that extracts pose-invariant correspondences between raw point clouds and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters and two differentiable compute blocks that recover the optimal transformation from matched GMM parameters. This construction allows the network learn an SE(3)-invariant feature space, producing a global registration method that is real-time, generalizable, and robust to noise.

We design our system to be trained in an end-to-end and weakly-supervised manner; therefore, it does not require groundtruth meshes.

In this work, we design a physical driven architecture, namely DeepSFM, inspired by traditional Bundle Adjustment (BA), which consists of two cost volume based architectures for depth and pose estimation respectively, iteratively running to improve both. The explicit constraints on both depth (structure) and pose (motion), when combined with the learning components, bring the merit from both traditional BA and emerging deep learning technology. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both depth and pose estimation with superior robustness against less number of inputs and the noise in initialization.\"",

Specifically, we consider the low dimensional manifold structure of natural images, and empirically verify that the leakage of the gradient (w.r.t input) along the (approximately) perpendicular direction to the tangent space of data manifold is a reason for the vulnerability over adversarial attacks. Based on our investigation, we further present a new robust learning algorithm which encourages a larger gradient component in the tangent space of data manifold, suppressing the gradient leaking phenomenon consequently.

        "abstract": "Defocus Blur Detection (DBD) aims to separate in-focus and out-of-focus regions from a single image pixel-wisely. This task has been paid much attention since bokeh effects are widely used in digital cameras and smartphone photography. However, identifying obscure homogeneous regions and borderline transitions in partially defocus images are still challenging. To solve these problems, we introduce depth information into DBD for the first time. When the camera parameters are fixed, we argue that the accuracy of DBD is highly related to scene depth. Hence, we consider the depth information as the approximate soft label of DBD and propose a joint learning framework inspired by knowledge distillation. In detail, we learn the defocus blur from ground truth and the depth distilled from a well-trained depth estimation network at the same time. Thus, the sharp region will provide a strong prior for depth estimation while the blur detection also gains benefits from the distilled depth. Besides, we propose a novel decoder in the fully convolutional network (FCN) as our network structure. In each level of decoder, we design the Selective Reception Field Block (SRFB) for merging multi-scale features efficiently and reuse the side outputs as Supervision-guided Attention Block(SAB). Unlike previous methods, the proposed decoder builds reception field pyramids and emphasizes salient regions simply and efficiently. Experiments show that our approach outperforms 11 other state-of-the-art methods on two popular datasets. Our method also runs at over 30 fps on a single GPU, which is 2x faster than previous works.\"",

Correcting defocus blur is challenging because the blur is spatially varying and difficult to estimate. We propose an effective defocus deblurring method that exploits data available on dual-pixel (DP) sensors found on most modern cameras. DP sensors are used to assist a camera's auto-focus by capturing two sub-aperture views of the scene in a single image shot. The two sub-aperture images are used to calculate the appropriate lens position to focus on a particular scene region and are discarded afterwards. We introduce a deep neural network (DNN) architecture that uses these discarded sub-aperture images to reduce defocus blur. A key contribution of our effort is a carefully captured dataset of 500 scenes (2000 images) where each scene has: (i) an image with defocus blur captured at a large aperture; (ii) the two associated DP sub-aperture views; and (iii) the corresponding all-in-focus image captured with a small aperture. Our proposed DNN produces results that are significantly better than conventional single image methods in terms of both quantitative and perceptual metrics -- all from data that is already available on the camera but ignored.",

However, given a finite collection of 3D shapes, even the closest model to a query may not be satisfactory. This motivates us to apply 3D model deformation techniques to adapt the retrieved model so as to better fit the query. Yet, certain restrictions are enforced in most 3D deformation techniques to preserve important features of the original model that prevent a perfect fitting of the deformed model to the query. This gap between the deformed model and the query induces mph{asymmetric} relationships among the models, which cannot be handled by typical metric learning techniques. Thus, to retrieve the best models for fitting, we propose a novel deep embedding approach that learns the asymmetric relationships by leveraging location-dependent egocentric distance fields. We also propose two strategies for training the embedding network. We demonstrate that both of these approaches outperform other baselines in our experiments with both synthetic and real data.

Our novel hybrid recurrent multi-view stereo net consists of two core modules: 1) a light DRENet (Dense Reception Expanded) module to extract dense feature maps of original size with multi-scale context information, 2) a hybrid HRU-LSTM (Hybrid Recurrent U-LSTM) to regularize 3D matching volume into predicted depth map, which efficiently aggregates different scale information by coupling LSTM and U-Net architecture. To further improve the accuracy and completeness of reconstructed point clouds, we leverage a dynamic consistency checking strategy instead of prefixed parameters and strategies widely adopted in existing methods for dense point cloud reconstruction. In doing so, we dynamically aggregate geometric consistency matching error among all the views.

In this paper, we study the problem of describing visual attributes of texture on a novel dataset containing rich descriptions of textures, and conduct a systematic study of current generative and discriminative models for grounding language to images on this dataset. We find that while these models capture some properties of texture, they fail to capture several compositional properties, such as the colors of dots. We provide critical analysis of existing models by generating synthetic but realistic textures with different descriptions. Our dataset also allows us to train interpretable models and generate language-based explanations of what discriminative features are learned by deep networks for fine-grained categorization where texture plays a key role. We present visualizations of several fine-grained domains and show that texture attributes learned on our dataset offer improvements over expert-designed attributes on the Caltech-UCSD Birds dataset.\"",

Specifically, one of the intelligent agents - Q-BOT - is given two static frames from the beginning and the end of the video, as well as a finite number of opportunities to ask relevant natural language questions before describing the unseen video. A-BOT, the other agent who has already seen the entire video, assists Q-BOT to accomplish the goal by providing answers to those questions. We propose a QA-Cooperative Network with a dynamic dialog history update learning mechanism to transfer knowledge from A-BOT to Q-BOT, thus helping Q-BOT to better describe the video. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-BOT can effectively learn to describe an unseen video by the proposed model and the cooperative learning method, achieving the promising performance where Q-BOT is given the full ground truth history dialog.\"",

We investigate a phenomenon: patches designed to suppress real face detection appear face-like. This phenomenon holds generally across different initialization, locations, scales of patches, backbones, and state-of-the-art face detection frameworks. We propose new optimization-based approaches to automatic design of universal adversarial patches for varying goals of the attack, including scenarios in which true positives are suppressed without introducing false positives.

In this work, instead of using a global feature to recover the whole complete surface, we explore multi-level features by hierarchical feature learning and represent the existing-part and the missing-part respectively. We propose two different feature aggregation strategies, named global & local feature aggregation(GLFA) and residual feature aggregation(RFA), to express the two parts features and reconstruct coordinates from the combined features. In addition, we also design a refinement component to prevent the generated point from non-uniform distribution and outliers.

For effective generalization, however, such an image representation needs to capture a diverse range of data characteristics. To this end, we propose and study multiple complementary learning tasks, targeting conceptually different data relationships by only resorting to the available training samples and labels of a standard DML setting.

It boosts the performance of a miniaturized student network with the supervision of the output distribution and feature maps from a sophisticated teacher network. Some recent works introduce multi-teacher distillation to provide more supervision to the student network. However, the effectiveness of multi-teacher distillation methods are accompanied by costly computation resources. To tackle with both the efficiency and the effectiveness of knowledge distillation, we introduce the feature aggregation to imitate the multi-teacher distillation in the single-teacher distillation framework by extracting informative supervision from multiple teacher feature maps. Specifically, we introduce DFA, a two-stage Differentiable Feature Aggregation search method that motivated by DARTS in neural architecture search, to efficiently find the aggregations. In the first stage, DFA formulates the searching problem as a bi-level optimization and leverages a novel bridge loss, which consists of a student-to-teacher path and a teacher-to-student path, to find appropriate feature aggregations. The two paths act as two players against each other, trying to optimize the unified architecture parameters to the opposite directions while guaranteeing both expressivity and learnability of the feature aggregation simultaneously. In the second stage, DFA performs knowledge distillation with the derived feature aggregation. Experimental results show that DFA outperforms existing methods on CIFAR-100 and CINIC-10 datasets under various teacher-student settings, verifying the effectiveness and robustness of the design.\"",

Previous methods can be divided into two streams, \\ie top-down and bottom-up methods. The top-down methods localize keypoints after human detection, while the bottom-up methods localize keypoints directly and then cluster/group them for different persons, which are generally more efficient than top-down methods. However, in existing bottom-up methods, the keypoint grouping is usually solved independently from keypoint detection, making them not end-to-end trainable and have sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we investigate a new perspective of human part grouping and reformulate it as a graph clustering task. Especially, we propose a novel differentiable Hierarchical Graph Grouping (HGG) method to learn the graph grouping in bottom-up multi-person pose estimation task. Moreover, HGG is easily embedded into main-stream bottom-up methods. It takes human keypoint candidates as graph nodes and clusters keypoints in a multi-layer graph neural network model. The modules of HGG can be trained end-to-end with the keypoint detection network and is able to supervise the grouping process in a hierarchical manner. To improve the discrimination of the clustering, we add a set of edge discriminators and macro-node discriminators. Extensive experiments on both COCO and OCHuman datasets demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance of bottom-up pose estimation methods.\"",

While previous works always consider pruning and quantization separately, our method enables users to find the optimal trade-off between both in a single training procedure. To utilize the method for more efficient hardware inference, we extend DJPQ to integrate structured pruning with power-of-two bit-restricted quantization. We show that DJPQ significantly reduces the number of Bit-Operations (BOPs) for several networks while maintaining the top-1 accuracy of original floating-point models (e.g.,53x BOPs reduction in ResNet18 on ImageNet, 43x in MobileNetV2). Compared to the conventional two-stage approach, which optimizes pruning and quantization independently, our scheme outperforms in terms of both accuracy and BOPs. Even when considering bit-restricted quantization, DJPQ achieves larger compression ratios and better accuracy than the two-stage approach.\"",

Characteristic spectral features make many pure materials identifiable from their visible-to-infrared spectra, but quantifying their presence within a mixture is a challenging task due to nonlinearities and factors of variation. In this paper, spectral variation is considered from a physics-based approach and incorporated into an end-to-end spectral unmixing algorithm via differentiable programming. The dispersion model is introduced to simulate realistic spectral variation, and an efficient method to fit the parameters is presented. Then, this dispersion model is utilized as a generative model within an analysis-by-synthesis spectral unmixing algorithm. Further, a technique for inverse rendering using a convolutional neural network to predict parameters of the generative model is introduced to enhance performance and speed when training data is available. Results achieve state-of-the-art on both infrared and visible-to-near-infrared (VNIR) datasets, and show promise for the synergy between physics-based models and deep learning in hyperspectral unmixing in the future.\"",

When light passes through a diffraction grating, it disperses as a function of wavelength. We exploit this principle to recover 2D and even 3D positions from only line images. We derive a detailed image formation model and a learning-based algorithm for 2D position estimation. We show several extensions of our system to improve the accuracy of the 2D positioning and expand the effective field of view. We demonstrate our approach in two applications: (a) fast passive imaging of sparse light sources like street lamps, headlights at night and LED-based motion capture, and (b) structured light 3D scanning with line illumination and line sensing. Line imaging has several advantages over 2D sensors: high frame rate, high dynamic range, high fill-factor with additional on-chip computation, low-cost beyond the visible spectrum, and high energy efficiency when used with line illumination. Thus, our system is able to achieve high-speed and high-accuracy 2D positioning of light sources and 3D scanning of scenes.\"",

Previously, the research community tries to tackle it by aggregating the elements in a group based on an extit{indicator} either defined by humans such as the extit{quality} and extit{saliency}, or generated by a black box such as the attention score. This article provides a more essential and explicable view. We claim the most significant indicator to show whether the group representation can be benefited from one of its element is not the quality or an inexplicable score, but the extit{discriminability w.r.t.} the model. We explicitly design the extit{discrimiability} using embedded class centroids on a proxy set. We show the discrimiability knowledge has good properties that can be distilled by a light-weight distillation network and can be generalized on the unseen target set. The whole procedure is denoted as extit{discriminability distillation learning} (DDL). The proposed DDL can be flexibly plugged into many group-based recognition tasks without influencing the original training procedures. Comprehensive experiments on various tasks have proven the effectiveness of DDL for both accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, it pushes forward the state-of-the-art results on these tasks by an impressive margin.\"",

        "abstract": "Domain adaptation (DA) has been a fundamental building block for Transfer Learning (TL) which assumes that source and target domain share the same label space. A more general and realistic setting is that the label space of target domain is a subset of the source domain, as termed by Partial domain adaptation (PDA). Previous methods typically match the whole source domain to target domain, which causes negative transfer due to the source-negative classes in source domain that does not exist in target domain. In this paper, a novel Discriminative Partial Domain Adversarial Network (DPDAN) is developed. We first propose to use hard binary weighting to differentiate the source-positive and source-negative samples in the source domain. The source-positive samples are those with labels shared by two domains, while the rest in the source domain are treated as source-negative samples. Based on the above binary relabeling strategy, our algorithm maximizes the distribution divergence between source-negative samples and all the others (source-positive and target samples), meanwhile minimizes domain shift between source-positive samples and target domain to obtain discriminative domain-invariant features. We empirically verify DPDAN can effectively reduce the negative transfer caused by source-negative classes, and also theoretically show it decreases negative transfer caused by domain shift. Experiments on four benchmark domain adaptation datasets show DPDAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.\"",

We also observe that the two terms trained alone tend to model different visual clues, e.g. the whitened pairwise term learns within-region relationships while the unary term learns salient boundaries. However, the two terms are tightly coupled in the non-local block, which hinders the learning of each. Based on these findings, we present the disentangled non-local block, where the two terms are decoupled to facilitate learning for both terms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the decoupled design on various tasks, including semantic segmentation, object detection and action recognition. The code will be made publicly available.\"",

UR3D formulates different tasks of detection by exploiting the scale information, to reduce model capacity requirement and achieve accurate monocular 3D object detection. Besides, distance estimation is enhanced by a distance-guided NMS, which automatically selects candidate boxes with better distance estimates. In addition, an efficient fully convolutional cascaded point regression method is proposed to infer accurate locations of the projected 2D corners and centers of 3D boxes, which can be used to recover object physical size and orientation by a projection-consistency loss.

The Distribution-Balanced Loss tackles these issues through two key modifications to the standard binary cross-entropy loss: 1) a new way to re-balance the weights that takes into account the impact caused by label co-occurrence, and 2) a negative tolerant regularization to mitigate the over-suppression of negative labels.

Due to partial observability in these dynamical scenes, directly obtaining the posterior distribution over future agent trajectories remains a challenging problem. In realistic embodied environments, each agent's future trajectories should be both diverse since multiple plausible sequences of actions can be used to reach its intended goals, and admissible since they must obey physical constraints and stay in drivable areas. In this paper, we propose a model that synthesizes multiple input signals from the multimodal world|the environment's scene context and interactions between multiple surrounding agents|to best model all diverse and admissible trajectories. We compare our model with strong baselines and ablations across two public datasets and show a significant performance improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we offer new metrics incorporating admissibility criteria to further study and evaluate the diversity of predictions. Codes are at: https://github.com/kami93/CMU-DATF\"",

        "abstract": "In the conventional person Re-ID setting, it is assumed that cropped images are the person images within the bounding box for each individual. However, in a crowded scene, off-shelf-detectors may generate bounding boxes involving multiple people, where the large proportion of background pedestrians or human occlusion exists. The representation extracted from such cropped images, which contain both the target and the interference pedestrians, might include distractive information. This will lead to wrong retrieval results. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel deep network termed Pedestrian-Interference Suppression Network (PISNet). PISNet leverages a Query-Guided Attention Block (QGAB) to enhance the feature of the target in the gallery, under the guidance of the query. Furthermore, the involving Guidance Reversed Attention Module and the Multi-Person Separation Loss promote QGAB to suppress the interference of other pedestrians. Our method is evaluated on two new pedestrian-interference datasets and the results show that the proposed method performs favorably against existing Re-ID methods.\"",

        "abstract": "The 2D virtual try-on task has recently attracted a great interest from the research community, for its direct potential applications in online shopping as well as for its inherent and non-addressed scientific challenges. This task requires fitting an in-shop cloth image on the image of a person, which is highly challenging because it involves cloth warping, image compositing, and synthesizing. Casting virtual try-on into a supervised task faces a difficulty: available datasets are composed of pairs of pictures (cloth, person wearing the cloth). Thus, we have no access to ground-truth when the cloth on the person changes. State-of-the-art models solve this by masking the cloth information on the person with both a human parser and a pose estimator. Then, image synthesis modules are trained to reconstruct the person image from a masked person image and a cloth image. This procedure has several caveats: firstly, human parsers are prone to errors; secondly, it is a costly pre-processing step, which also has to be applied at inference time; finally, it makes the task harder than it is since the mask covers information that should be kept such as hands or accessories. In this paper, we propose a novel student-teacher paradigm where the teacher is trained in the standard way (reconstruction) before guiding the student to focus on the initial task (changing the cloth). The student additionally learns from an adversarial loss, which pushes it to follow the distribution of the real images. Consequently, the student exploits information that is masked to the teacher. A student trained without the adversarial loss would not use this information. Also, getting rid of both human parser and pose estimator at inference time allows obtaining a real-time virtual try-on.\"",

In this paper, we share our findings on employing a hierarchical semantic segmentation network for this task of structure extraction. We propose a prior based deep hierarchical CNN network architecture that enables document structure extraction using very high resolution(1800 x 1000) images. We divide the document image into overlapping horizontal strips such that the network segments a strip and uses its prediction mask as prior for predicting the segmentation of the subsequent strip. We perform experiments establishing the effectiveness of our strip based network architecture through ablation methods and comparison with low-resolution variations. Further, to demonstrate our network's capabilities, we train it on only one type of documents (Forms) and achieve state-of-the-art results over other general document datasets. We introduce our new human-annotated forms dataset and show that our method significantly outperforms different segmentation baselines on this dataset in extracting hierarchical structures.Our method is currently being used in Adobe's AEM Forms for automated conversion of paper and PDF forms to modern HTML based forms.\"",

However, this transfer is challenging since simulated and real-world visual experiences vary dramatically. Our core observation is that for certain tasks, such as image recognition, datasets are plentiful. They exist in any interesting domain, simulated or real, and are easy to label and extend. We use these recognition datasets to link up a source and target domain to transfer models between them in a task distillation framework. Our method can successfully transfer navigation policies between drastically different simulators: ViZDoom, SuperTuxKart, and CARLA. Furthermore, it shows promising results on standard domain adaptation benchmarks.\"",

        "abstract": "Conventional object detection models inevitably encounter a performance drop as the domain disparity exists. Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection is proposed recently to reduce the disparity between domains, where the source domain is label-rich while the target domain is label-agnostic. The existing models follow a parameter shared siamese structure for adversarial domain alignment, which, however, easily leads to the collapse and out-of-control risk of the source domain and brings negative impact to feature adaption. The main reason is that the labeling unfairness (asymmetry) between source and target makes the parameter sharing mechanism unable to adapt. Therefore, in order to avoid the source domain collapse risk caused by parameter sharing, we propose an asymmetric tri-way Faster-RCNN (ATF) for domain adaptive object detection. Our ATF model has two distinct merits: 1) A ancillary net supervised by source label is deployed to learn ancillary target features and simultaneously preserve the discrimination of source domain, which enhances the structural discrimination (object classification vs. bounding box regression) of domain alignment. 2) The asymmetric structure consisting of a chief net and an independent ancillary net essentially overcomes the parameter sharing aroused source risk collapse. The adaption safety of the proposed ATF detector is guaranteed. Extensive experiments on a number of datasets, including Cityscapes, Foggy-cityscapes, KITTI, Sim10k, Pascal VOC, Clipart and Watercolor, demonstrate the SOTA performance of our method.\"",

The weak labels may be obtained based on a model prediction for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), or from a human oracle in a new weakly-supervised domain adaptation (WDA) paradigm for semantic segmentation. Using weak labels is both practical and useful, since (i) collecting image-level target annotations is comparably cheap in WDA and incurs no cost in UDA, and (ii) it opens the opportunity for category-wise domain alignment. Our framework uses weak labels to enable the interplay between feature alignment and pseudo-labeling, improving both in the process of domain adaptation. Specifically, we develop a weak-label classification module to enforce the network to attend to certain categories, and then use such training signals to guide the proposed category-wise alignment method. In experiments, we show considerable improvements with respect to the existing state-of-the-arts in UDA and present a new benchmark in the WDA setting.\"",

For addressing this issue, this paper leverages domain-specific mappings for remapping latent features in the shared content space to domain-specific content spaces. This way, images can be encoded more properly for style transfer. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms previous style transfer methods, particularly on challenging scenarios that would require semantic correspondences between images.

The success of deep neural network in denoising stimulates the research of noise generation, aiming at synthesizing more pairs of clean-noisy images to facilitate the training of deep. In this work, we propose a novel unified framework to simultaneously deal with the noise removal and noise generation tasks. Instead of only inferring the posterior distribution of the latent clean image conditioned on the observed noisy image in traditional MAP framework, it learns the joint distribution of the clean-noisy image pairs. Specifically, we approximate the joint distribution with two different factorized forms, which can be formulated as a denoiser mapping the noisy image to the clean one and a generator mapping the clean to the noisy one. The learned joint distribution implicitly contains all the information between the noisy and clean images, avoiding the necessity of manually designing the image priors and noise assumptions as traditional. Besides, the performance of our denoiser can be further improved by augmenting the original training dataset with the learned generator. Moreover, we propose two metrics to assess the quality of the generated noisy image, for which, to the best of our knowledge, such metrics are first proposed along this research line. Extensive experiments have conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-arts in terms of both the real noise removal and noise generation tasks.\"",

        "abstract": "Recent advances on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) rely on adversarial learning to disentangle the explanatory and transferable features for domain adaptation. However, there are two issues with the existing methods. First, the discriminability of the latent space cannot be fully guaranteed without considering the class-aware information in the target domain. Second, samples from the source and target domains alone are not sufficient for domain-invariant feature extracting in the latent space. In order to alleviate the above issues, we propose a dual mixup regularized learning (DMRL) method for UDA, which not only guides the classifier in enhancing consistent predictions in-between samples, but also enriches the intrinsic structures of the latent space. The DMRL jointly conducts category and domain mixup regularizations on pixel level to improve the effectiveness of models. A series of empirical studies on four domain adaptation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach can achieve the state-of-the-art.\"",

Generic detection algorithms can not work well when we use them directly in the underwater scene. To address these problems, we propose an underwater detection framework with feature enhancement and anchor refinement. It has a composite connection backbone to boost the feature representation and introduces a receptive field augmentation module to exploit multi-scale contextual features. The developed underwater object detection framework also provides a prediction refinement scheme according to six prediction layers, it can refine multi-scale features to better align with anchors by learning from offsets, which solve the problem of sample imbalance to a certain extent. We also construct a new underwater detection dataset, denoted as UWD, which has more than 10,000 train-val and test underwater images. The extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and UWD demonstrate the favorable performance of the proposed underwater detection framework against the states-of-the-arts methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.

DDS is a generic framework to represent and compare data of different feature dimensions. We validate our approach on the Taskonomy dataset by measuring the correspondence between actual transfer learning performance rankings on 17 taskonomy tasks and predicted rankings. Computing DDS based ranking for $17 imes17$ transfers requires less than 2 minutes and shows a high correlation ($0.86$) with actual transfer learning rankings, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin ($10\\%$) on the Taskonomy benchmark. We also demonstrate the robustness of our model selection approach to a new task, namely Pascal VOC semantic segmentation.

Our network uses a novel architecture to fuse these two sources of information and can overcome the above-mentioned limitations of pure binocular stereo matching. Our method provides a dense depth map with sharp edges, which is crucial for computational photography applications like synthethic shallow-depth-of-field or 3D Photos. Additionally, we avoid the inherent ambiguity due to the aperture problem in stereo cameras by designing the stereo baseline to be orthogonal to the dual-pixel baseline.

Existing VI-ReID methods instead tend to learn global representations, which have limited discriminability and weak robustness to noisy images. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic dual-attentive aggregation (DDAG) learning method by mining both intra-modality part-level and cross-modality graph-level contextual cues for VI-ReID. We propose an intra-modality weighted-part attention module to extract discriminative part-aggregated features, by imposing the domain knowledge on the part relationship mining. To enhance robustness against noisy samples, we introduce cross-modality graph structured attention to reinforce the representation with the contextual relations across the two modalities. We also develop a parameter-free dynamic dual aggregation learning strategy to adaptively integrate the two components in a progressive joint training manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDAG outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under various settings.\"",

However, existing group convolutions undermine the original network structures by cutting off some connections permanently resulting in significant accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose dynamic group convolution (DGC) that adaptively selects which part of input channels to be connected within each group for individual samples on the fly. Specifically, we equip each group with a small feature selector to automatically select the most important input channels conditioned on the input images. Multiple groups can adaptively capture abundant and complementary visual/semantic features for each input image. The DGC preserves the original network structure and has similar computational efficiency as the conventional group convolution simultaneously. Extensive experiments on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate its superiority over the existing group convolution techniques and dynamic execution methods.

Imaging dynamic scenes in low-light environments is even more difficult because as the scene moves, pixels in adjacent frames need to be aligned before they can be denoised. Conventional CMOS image sensors (CIS) are at a particular disadvantage in dynamic low-light settings because the exposure cannot be too short lest the read noise overwhelms the signal. We propose a solution using Quanta Image Sensors (QIS) and present a new image reconstruction algorithm. QIS are single-photon image sensors with photon counting capabilities. Studies over the past decade have confirmed the effectiveness of QIS for low-light imaging but reconstruction algorithms for dynamic scenes in low light remain an open problem. We fill the gap by proposing a student-teacher training protocol that transfers knowledge from a motion teacher and a denoising teacher to a student network. We show that dynamic scenes can be reconstructed from a burst of frames at a photon level of 1 photon per pixel per frame. Experimental results confirm the advantages of the proposed method compared to existing methods.\"",

In this work, we first point out the inconsistency problem between the fixed network settings and the dynamic training procedure, which greatly affects the performance. For example, the fixed label assignment strategy and regression loss function cannot fit the distribution change of proposals and thus are harmful to training high quality detectors. Consequently, we propose Dynamic R-CNN to adjust the label assignment criteria (IoU threshold) and the shape of regression loss function (parameters of SmoothL1 Loss) automatically based on the statistics of proposals during training. This dynamic design makes better use of the training samples and pushes the detector to fit more high quality samples.

Existing work addressed this challenge by either learning social spatial interactions represented by the positions of a group of pedestrians, while ignoring their temporal coherence (\\ie dependencies between different long trajectories), or by understanding the complicated scene layout (g scene segmentation) to ensure safe navigation. However, unlike previous work that isolated the spatial interaction, temporal coherence, and scene layout, this paper designs a new mechanism, \\ie, Dynamic and Static Context-aware Motion Predictor (DSCMP), to integrates these rich information into the long-short-term-memory (LSTM). It has three appealing benefits. (1) DSCMP models the dynamic interactions between agents by learning both their spatial positions and temporal coherence, as well as understanding the contextual scene layout. (2) Different from previous LSTM models that predict motions by propagating hidden features frame by frame, limiting the capacity to learn correlations between long trajectories, we carefully design a differentiable queue mechanism in DSCMP, which is able to explicitly memorize and learn the correlations between long trajectories. (3) DSCMP captures the context of scene by inferring latent variable, which enables multimodal predictions with meaningful semantic scene layout. Extensive experiments show that DSCMP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins, such as 9.05\\% and 7.62\\% relative improvements on the ETH-UCY and SDD datasets respectively.\"",

However, debiasing in CAD is not trivial because existing methods cannot cure the two types of bias to categorize fundus images. In this paper, we propose a novel curriculum learning paradigm (EGDCL) to train an unbiased glaucoma diagnosis model with the adaptive dual-curriculum. Innovatively, the dual-curriculum is designed with the guidance of evidence maps to build a training criterion, which gradually cures the bias in training data. In particular, the dual-curriculum emphasizes unbiased training contributions of data from easy to hard, normal to abnormal, and the dual-curriculum is optimized jointly with model parameters to obtain the optimal solution. In comparison to baselines, EGDCL significantly improves the convergence speed of the training process and obtains the top performance in the test procedure. Experimental results on challenging glaucoma datasets show that our EGDCL delivers unbiased diagnosis (0.9721 of Sensitivity, 0.9707 of Specificity, 0.993 of AUC, 0.966 of F2-score) and outperform the other methods. It endows our EGDCL a great advantage to handle the unbiased CAD in clinical application.\"",

        "abstract": "Gaze estimation is a fundamental task in many applications of computer vision, human computer interaction and robotics. Many state-of-the-art methods are trained and tested on custom datasets, making comparison across methods challenging. Furthermore, existing gaze estimation datasets have limited head pose and gaze variations, and the evaluations are conducted using different protocols and metrics. In this paper, we propose a new gaze estimation dataset called ETH-XGaze, consisting of over one million high-resolution images of varying gaze under extreme head poses. We collect this dataset from 110 participants with a custom hardware setup including 18 digital SLR cameras and adjustable illumination conditions, and a calibrated system to record ground truth gaze targets. We show that our dataset can significantly improve the robustness of gaze estimation methods across different head poses and gaze angles. Additionally, we define a standardized experimental protocol and evaluation metric on ETH-XGaze, to better unify gaze estimation research going forward. The dataset and benchmark website are available at https://ait.ethz.ch/projects/2020/ETH-XGaze\"",

Many algorithms try to predict model performance of the pruned sub-nets by introducing various evaluation methods. But they are either inaccurate or very complicated for general application. In this work, we present a pruning method called EagleEye, in which a simple yet efficient evaluation component based on adaptive batch normalization is applied to unveil a strong correlation between different pruned DNN structures and their final settled accuracy. This strong correlation allows us to fast spot the pruned candidates with highest potential accuracy without actually fine-tuning them. This module is also general to plug-in and improve some existing pruning algorithms. EagleEye achieves better pruning performance than all of the studied pruning algorithms in our experiments. Concretely, to prune MobileNet V1 and ResNet-50, EagleEye outperforms all compared methods by up to 3.8%. Even in the more challenging experiments of pruning the compact model of MobileNet V1, EagleEye achieves the highest accuracy of 70.9% with an overall 50% operations (FLOPs) pruned. All accuracy results are Top-1 ImageNet classification accuracy. Source code and models are accessible to open-source community.https://github.com/anonymous47823493/EagleEye\"",

        "abstract": "Lossy image compression is pervasively conducted to save communication bandwidth, resulting in undesirable compression artifacts. Recently, extensive approaches have been proposed to reduce image compression artifacts at the decoder side; however, they require a series of architecture-identical models to process images with different quality, which are inefficient and resource-consuming. Besides, it is common in practice that compressed images are with unknown quality and it is intractable for existing approaches to select a suitable model for blind quality enhancement. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient blind quality enhancement (RBQE) approach for compressed images. Specifically, our approach blindly and progressively enhances the quality of compressed images through a dynamic deep neural network (DNN), in which an early-exit strategy is embedded. Then, our approach can automatically decide to terminate or continue enhancement according to the assessed quality of enhanced images. Consequently, slight artifacts can be removed in a simpler and faster process, while the severe artifacts can be further removed in a more elaborate process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RBQE approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both blind quality enhancement and resource efficiency.\"",

Previous methods have shown their efficiency in face parsing, which however overlook the correlation among different face regions. The correlation is a critical clue about the facial appearance, pose, expression etc., and should be taken into account for face parsing. To this end, we propose to model and reason the region-wise relations by learning graph representations, and leverage the edge information between regions for optimized abstraction. Specifically, we encode a facial image onto a global graph representation where a collection of pixels (\"\"regions\"\") with similar features are projected to each vertex. Our model learns and reasons over relations between the regions by propagating information across vertices on the graph. Furthermore, we incorporate the edge information to aggregate the pixel-wise features onto vertices, which emphasizes on the features around edges for fine segmentation along edges. The finally learned graph representation is projected back to pixel grids for parsing. Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the widely used Helen dataset, and also exhibits the superior performance on the large-scale CelebAMask-HQ dataset.\"",

        "abstract": "It has been a primary concern in recent studies of vision and language tasks to design an effective attention mechanism dealing with interactions between the two modalities. The Transformer has recently been extended and applied to several bi-modal tasks, yielding promising results. For visual dialog, it becomes necessary to consider interactions between three or more inputs, i.e., an image, a question, and a dialog history, or even its individual dialog components. In this paper, we present a neural architecture named Light-weight Transformer for Many Inputs (LTMI) that can efficiently deal with all the interactions between multiple such inputs in visual dialog. It has a block structure similar to the Transformer and employs the same design of attention computation, whereas it has only a small number of parameters, yet has sufficient representational power for the purpose. Assuming a standard setting of visual dialog, a layer built upon the proposed attention block has less than one-tenth of parameters as compared with its counterpart, a natural Transformer extension. The experimental results on the VisDial datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing improvements of the best NDCG score on the VisDial v1.0 dataset from 57.59 to 60.92 with a single model, from 64.47 to 66.53 with ensemble models, and even to 74.88 with additional finetuning.\"",

Our proposed modifications can reduce the memory footprint and execution time more than $10 imes$, with equivalent results. This is achieved by sparsifying the correlation tensor containing tentative matches, and its subsequent processing with a 4D CNN using submanifold sparse convolutions. Localisation accuracy is significantly improved by processing the input images in higher resolution, which is possible due to the reduced memory footprint, and by a novel two-stage correspondence relocalisation module. The proposed Sparse-NCNet method obtains state-of-the art results on the HPatches Sequences and InLoc visual localisation benchmarks, and competitive results on the Aachen Day-Night benchmark.\"",

We propose a circular and confocal non-line-of-sight (C$^2$NLOS) scan that involves illuminating and imaging a common point, and scanning this point in a circular path along a wall. We observe that (1) these C$^2$NLOS measurements consist of a superposition of sinusoids, which we refer to as a transient sinogram, (2) there exists computationally efficient reconstruction procedures that transform these sinusoidal measurements into 3D positions of hidden scatterers or NLOS images of hidden objects, and (3) despite operating on an order of magnitude fewer measurements than previous approaches, these C$^2$NLOS scans provide sufficient information about the hidden scene to solve these different NLOS imaging tasks. We show results from both simulated and real C$^2$NLOS scans.\"",

In contrast, here we explicitly consider the temporal consistency among frames as extra constraints during training and process each frame independently in the inference phase. Thus no computation overhead is introduced for inference. Compact models are employed for real-time execution. To narrow the performance gap between compact models and large models, new temporal knowledge distillation methods are designed.

To improve the network efficiency, we adopt residual dense blocks into RNN cells, so as to efficiently extract the spatial features of the current frame. Furthermore, a global spatio-temporal attention module is proposed to fuse the effective hierarchical features from past and future frames to help better deblur the current frame. For evaluation, we also collect a novel dataset with paired blurry/sharp video clips by using a co-axis beam splitter system.

        "abstract": "Transfer learning can boost the performance on the target task by leveraging the knowledge of the source domain. Recent works in neural architecture search (NAS), especially one-shot NAS, can aid transfer learning by establishing sufficient network search space. However, existing NAS methods tend to approximate huge search spaces by explicitly building giant super-networks with multiple sub-paths, and discard super-network weights after a child structure is found. Both the characteristics of existing approaches causes repetitive network training on source tasks in transfer learning. To remedy the above issues, we reduce the super-network size by randomly dropping connection between network blocks while embedding a larger search space. Moreover, we reuse super-network weights to avoid redundant training by proposing a novel framework consisting of two modules, the neural architecture search module for architecture transfer and the neural weight search module for weight transfer. These two modules conduct search on the target task based on a reduced super-networks, so we only need to train once on the source task. We experiment our framework on both MS-COCO and CUB-200 for the object detection and fine-grained image classification tasks, and show promising improvements with only $O(C^{N})$ super-network complexity.\"",

State-of-the-art semantic segmentation algorithms are mostly based on dilated Fully Convolutional Networks (dilatedFCN), which adopt dilated convolutions in the backbone networks to extract high-resolution feature maps for achieving high-performance segmentation performance. However,due to many convolution operations are conducted on the high-resolution feature maps, such dilatedFCN-based methods result in large computational complexity and memory consumption. To balance the performance and efficiency, there also exist encoder-decoder structures that gradually recover the spatial information by combining multi-level feature maps from the encoder. However, the performances of existing encoder-decoder methods are far from comparable with the dilatedFCN-based methods. In this paper, we propose the EfficientFCN, whose backbone is a common ImageNet pretrained network without any dilated convolution. A holistically-guided decoder is introduced to obtain the high-resolution semantic-rich feature maps via the multi-scale features from the encoder. The decoding task is converted to novel codebook generation and codeword assembly tasks, which takes advantages of the high-level and low-level features from the encoder. Such a framework achieves comparable or even better performance than state-of-the-art methods with only 1/3 of the computational cost. Extensive experiments on PASCAL Context, PASCAL VOC, ADE20K validate the effectiveness of the proposed EfficientFCN.\"",

This distribution shift often results in poor generalization. Manifold smoothing has been shown to address the distribution shift problem by extending the decision boundaries and reducing the noise of the class representations. Moreover, manifold smoothness is a key factor for semi-supervised learning and transductive learning algorithms. In this work, we propose to use embedding propagation as an unsupervised non-parametric regularizer for manifold smoothing in few-shot classification. Embedding propagation leverages interpolations between the extracted features of a neural network based on a similarity graph. We empirically show that embedding propagation yields a smoother embedding manifold. We also show that applying embedding propagation to a transductive classifier achieves new state-of-the-art results in extit{mini}Imagenet, extit{tiered}Imagenet, Imagenet-FS, and CUB. Furthermore, we show that embedding propagation consistently improves the accuracy of the models in multiple semi-supervised learning scenarios by up to 16\\% points. The proposed embedding propagation operation can be easily integrated as a non-parametric layer into a neural network.

A typical pipeline for this problem is first to adopt class activation maps (CAM) with image-level labels to generate pseudo-masks (a.k.a. seeds) and then use them for training segmentation models. The main difficulty is that seeds are usually sparse and incomplete. Related works typically try to alleviate this problem by adopting many bells and whistles to enhance the seeds. Instead of struggling to refine a single seed, we propose a novel approach to alleviate the inaccurate seed problem by leveraging the segmentation model's robustness to learn from multiple seeds. We managed to generate many different seeds for each image, which are different estimates of the underlying ground truth. The segmentation model simultaneously exploits these seeds to learn and automatically decides the confidence of each seed.

The core of our network is to augment the conditional random fields (CRF), amenable to learning inter-dependency of correlated observations, with the newly devised temporal and spatial self-attention to learn the temporal evolution and spatial relational contexts of every actor in videos. Such a combination utilizes the global receptive fields of self-attention to construct a spatio-temporal graph topology to address the temporal dependency and non-local relationships of the actors. The network first uses the temporal self-attention along with the spatial self-attention, which considers multiple cliques with different scales of locality to account for the diversity of the actors' relationships in group activities, to model the pairwise energy of CRF. Afterward, to accommodate the distinct characteristics of each video, a new mean-field inference algorithm with dynamic halting is also addressed. Finally, a bidirectional universal transformer encoder (UTE), which combines both of the forward and backward temporal context information, is used to aggregate the relational contexts and scene information for group activity recognition.

Whilst deep residual networks such as ResNet and DenseNet have become the standard backbones for many computer vision tasks, the cutting-edge WSOD methods still rely on plain networks, e.g., VGG, as backbones. It is indeed not trivial to employ deep residual networks for WSOD, which even shows significant deterioration of detection accuracy and non-convergence. In this paper, we discover the intrinsic root with sophisticated analysis and propose a sequence of design principles to take full advantages of deep residual learning for WSOD from the perspectives of adding redundancy, improving robustness and aligning features. First, a redundant adaptation neck is key for effective object instance localization and discriminative feature learning. Second, small-kernel convolutions and MaxPool down-samplings help improve the robustness of information flow, which gives finer object boundaries and make the detector more sensitivity to small objects. Third, dilated convolution is essential to align the proposal features and exploit diverse local information by extracting high-resolution feature maps. Extensive experiments show that the proposed principles enable deep residual networks to establishes new state-of-the-arts on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO.\"",

        "abstract": "Anomaly detection in retinal image refers to the identification of abnormality caused by various retinal diseases/lesions, by only leveraging normal images in training phase. Normal images from healthy subjects often have regular structures (e.g., the structured blood vessels in the fundus image, or structured anatomy in optical coherence tomography image). On the contrary, the diseases and lesions often destroy these structures. Motivated by this, we propose to leverage the relation between the image texture and structure to design a deep neural network for anomaly detection. Specifically, we first extract the structure of the retinal images, then we combine both the structure features and the last layer features extracted from original health image to reconstruct the original input healthy image. The image feature provides the texture information and guarantees the uniqueness of the image recovered from the structure. In the end, we further utilize the reconstructed image to extract the structure and measure the difference between structure extracted from original and the reconstructed image. On the one hand, minimizing the reconstruction difference behaves like a regularizer to guarantee that the image is corrected reconstructed. On the other hand, such structure difference can also be used as a metric for normality measurement. The whole network is termed as P-Net because it has a \"\"P\"\" shape. Extensive experiments on RESC dataset and iSee dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach for anomaly detection in retinal images. Further, our method also generalizes well to novel class discovery for retinal images and anomaly detection for real-world images. \"",

In order to jointly capture the self-attention across different dimensions in hyperspectral images (i.e., channel-wise spectral correlation and non-local spatial regions), we propose Spatial-Spectral Self-Attention (TSA) to process each dimension sequentially, yet in an order-independent manner. We employ TSA in an encoder-decoder network, dubbed TSA-Net, to reconstruct the desired 3D cube. Furthermore, we investigate how noise affects the results and propose to add shot noise in model training, which improves the real data results significantly.

        "abstract": "As an important computer vision task, 3d human pose estimation in a multi-camera, multi-person setting has received widespread attention and many interesting applications have been derived from it. Traditional approaches use a 3d pictorial structure model to handle this task. However, these models suffer from high computation costs and result in low accuracy in joint detection. Recently, especially since the introduction of Deep Neural Networks, one popular approach is to build a pipeline that involves three separate steps: (1) 2d skeleton detection in each camera view, (2) identification of matched 2d skeletons and (3) estimation of the 3d poses. Many existing works operate by feeding the 2d images and camera parameters through the three modules in a cascade fashion. However, all three operations can be highly correlated. For example, the 3d generation results may affect the results of detection in step 1, as does the matching algorithm in step 2. To address this phenomenon, we propose a novel end-to-end training scheme that brings the three separate modules into a single model. However, one outstanding problem of doing so is that the matching algorithm in step 2 appears to disjoint the pipeline. Therefore, we take our inspiration from the recent success in Capsule Networks, in which its Dynamic Routing step is also disjointed, but plays a crucial role in deciding how gradients are flowed from the upper to the lower layers. Similarly, a dynamic matching module in our work also decides the paths in which gradients flow from step 3 to step 1. Furthermore, as a large number of cameras are present, the existing matching algorithm either fails to deliver a robust performance or can be very inefficient. Thus, we additionally propose a novel matching algorithm that can match 2d poses from multiple views efficiently. The algorithm is robust and able to deal with situations of incomplete and false 2d detection as well.\"",

        "abstract": "Non-blind image deblurring is typically formulated as a linear least-squares problem regularized by natural priors on the corresponding sharp picture's gradients, which can be solved, for example, using a half-quadratic splitting method with Richardson fixed-point iterations for its least-squares updates and a proximal operator for the auxiliary variable updates. We propose to precondition the Richardson solver using approximate inverse filters of the (known) blur and natural image prior kernels. Using convolutions instead of a generic linear preconditioner allows extremely efficient parameter sharing across the image, and leads to significant gains in accuracy and/or speed compared to classical FFT and conjugate-gradient methods. More importantly, the proposed architecture is easily adapted to learning both the preconditioner and the proximal operator using CNN embeddings. This yields a simple and efficient algorithm for non-blind image deblurring which is fully interpretable, can be learned end to end, and whose accuracy matches or exceeds the state of the art, quite significantly, in the non-uniform case.\"",

        "abstract": "While deep learning-based classification is generally tackled using standardized approaches, a wide variety of techniques are employed for regression. In computer vision, one particularly popular such technique is that of confidence-based regression, which entails predicting a confidence value for each input-target pair $(x, y)$. While this approach has demonstrated impressive results, it requires important task-dependent design choices, and the predicted confidences lack a natural probabilistic meaning. We address these issues by proposing a general and conceptually simple regression method with a clear probabilistic interpretation. In our proposed approach, we create an energy-based model of the conditional target density $p(y | x)$, using a deep neural network to predict the un-normalized density from $(x, y)$. This model of $p(y | x)$ is trained by directly minimizing the associated negative log-likelihood, approximated using Monte Carlo sampling. We perform comprehensive experiments on four computer vision regression tasks. Our approach outperforms direct regression, as well as other probabilistic and confidence-based methods. Notably, our model achieves a $2.2\\%$ AP improvement over Faster-RCNN for object detection on the COCO dataset, and sets a new state-of-the-art on visual tracking when applied for bounding box estimation. In contrast to confidence-based methods, our approach is also shown to be directly applicable to more general tasks such as age and head-pose estimation.

However, most of the recent works assume the additive noise involved in the blurring process to be simple-distributed (i.e. Gaussian or Laplacian), while the real-world case is proved to be much more complicated. In this paper, we develop a new term to better fit the complex natural noise. Specifically, we use a weighted combination of a dense function (i.e. l2) and a newly designed enhanced sparse model termed as le, which is developed from two sparse models (i.e. l1 and l0), to fulfill the task. Moreover, we further suggest using le to regularize image gradients. Compared to the widely-adopted l0 sparse term, le can penalize more insignificant image details (Fig. 1). Based on the half-quadratic splitting method, we provide an effective scheme to optimize the overall formulation. Comprehensive evaluations on public datasets and real-world images demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method against state-of-the-art methods in terms of both speed and accuracy.\"",

This is achieved by modelling the event alignment according to candidate parameters and minimising the resultant dispersion. We provide a family of suitable entropy loss functions and an efficient approximation whose complexity is only linear with the number of events (e. g. the complexity does not depend on the number of image pixels). The framework is evaluated on several motion estimation problems, including optical flow and rotational motion.

Extensive experiments show that environment-agnostic multitask learning significantly reduces the performance gap between seen and unseen environments, and the navigation agent trained so outperforms baselines on unseen environments by 16\\% (relative measure on success rate) on VLN and 120\\% (goal progress) on NDH.

Achieving adequate smoothing is a fundamental goal of these image smoothing algorithms. We show that partially \"\"erasing\"\" the appearance preservation facilitate adequate image smoothing. In this paper, we call this manipulation as Erasing Appearance Preservation (EAP). We conduct an user study, allowing users to indicate the \"\"erasing\"\" positions by drawing scribbles interactively, to verify the correctness and effectiveness of EAP. We observe the characteristics of human-indicated \"\"erasing\"\" positions, and then formulate a simple and effective 0-1 knapsack to automatically synthesize the \"\"erasing\"\" positions. We test our synthesized erasing positions in a majority of image smoothing methods. Experimental results and large-scale perceptual human judgments show that the EAP solution tends to encourage the pattern separation or elimination capabilities of image smoothing algorithms. We further study the performance of the EAP solution in many image decomposition problems to decompose textures, shadows, and the challenging specular reflections. We also present examinations of diversiform image manipulation applications like texture removal, retexturing, intrinsic decomposition, layer extraction, recoloring, material manipulation, etc. Due to the widespread applicability of image smoothing, the EAP is also likely to be used in more image editing applications.\"",

        "abstract": "With extremely high temporal resolution, event cameras have a large potential for robotics and computer vision. However, their asynchronous imaging mechanism often aggravates the measurement sensitivity to noises and brings a physical burden to increase the image spatial resolution. To recover high-quality intensity images, one should address both denoising and super-resolution problems for event cameras. Since events depict brightness changes, with the enhanced degeneration model by the events, the clear and sharp high-resolution latent images can be recovered from the noisy, blurry and low-resolution intensity observations. Exploiting the framework of sparse learning, the events and the low-resolution intensity observations can be jointly considered. Based on this, we propose an explainable network, an event-enhanced sparse learning network (eSL-Net), to recover the high-quality images from event cameras. After training with a synthetic dataset, the proposed eSL-Net can largely improve the performance of the state-of-the-art by 7-12 dB. Furthermore, without additional training process, the proposed eSL-Net can be easily extended to generate continuous frames with frame-rate as high as the events. \"",

Recently, pattern recognition algorithms, such as learning-based methods, have made significant progress with event cameras by converting events into synchronous dense, image-like representations and applying traditional machine learning methods developed for standard cameras. However, these approaches discard the spatial and temporal sparsity inherent in event data at the cost of higher computational complexity and latency. In this work, we present a general framework for converting models trained on synchronous image-like event representations into asynchronous models with identical output, thus directly leveraging the intrinsic asynchronous and sparse nature of the event data. We show both theoretically and experimentally that this drastically reduces the computational complexity and latency of high-capacity, synchronous neural networks without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, our framework has several desirable characteristics: (i) it exploits spatial and temporal sparsity in the event data explicitly, (ii) it is agnostic to the event representation, network architecture, and task, and (iii) it does not require any train-time change, since it is compatible with the standard neural net-works\u2019 training process. We thoroughly validate the proposed framework on two computer vision tasks: object detection and object recognition. In these tasks, we reduce the computational complexity up to 20 times with respect to high-latency neural networks. At the same time, we outperform state-of-the-art asynchronous approaches up to 24.5% in prediction accuracy.\"",

In this paper, we study the novel fine-grained hashing topic to generate compact binary codes for fine-grained images, leveraging the search and storage efficiency of hash learning to alleviate the aforementioned problems. Specifically, we propose a unified end-to-end trainable network, termed as ExchNet. Based on attention mechanisms and proposed attention constraints, it can firstly obtain both local and global features to represent object parts and whole fine-grained objects, respectively. Furthermore, to ensure the discriminative ability and semantic meaning's consistency of these part-level features across images, we design a local feature alignment approach by performing a feature exchanging operation. Later, an alternative learning algorithm is employed to optimize the whole ExchNet and then generate the final binary hash codes. Validated by extensive experiments, our ExchNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generic hashing methods on five fine-grained datasets, which shows our effectiveness. Moreover, compared with other approximate nearest neighbor methods, ExchNet achieves the best speed-up and storage reduction, revealing its efficiency and practicality.\"",

The difficulties are to extract features to match a correct pair of different sets and also preserve two types of exchangeability required for set-to-set matching: the pair of sets, as well as the items in each set, should be exchangeable. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning architecture to address the abovementioned difficulties and also an efficient training framework for set-to-set matching. We evaluate the methods through experiments based on two industrial applications: fashion set recommendation and group re-identification. In these experiments, we show that the proposed method provides significant improvements and results compared with the state-of-the-art methods, thereby validating our architecture for the heterogeneous set matching problem.\"",

We define a new evaluation protocol called the ``inpainting game'', which is a curated set of 3648 triplets (probe, mate, nonmate) of 95 subjects, which differ by synthetically inpainting a chosen facial characteristic like the nose, eyebrows or mouth creating an inpainted nonmate. An XFR algorithm is tasked with generating a network attention map which best explains which regions in a probe image match with a mated image, and not with an inpainted nonmate for each triplet. This provides ground truth for quantifying what image regions contribute to face matching. Finally, we provide a comprehensive benchmark on this dataset comparing five state-of-the-art XFR algorithms on three facial matchers. This benchmark includes two new algorithms called subtree EBP and Density-based Input Sampling for Explanation (DISE) which outperform the state-of-the-art XFR by a wide margin.\"",

This paper introduces a novel weakly-supervised method for visual relationship detection that relies on minimal image-level predicate labels. A graph neural network is trained to classify predicates in images from a graph representation of detected objects, implicitly encoding an inductive bias for pairwise relations. We then frame relationship detection as the explanation of such a predicate classifier, i.e. we obtain a complete relation by recovering the subject and object of a predicted predicate. We present results comparable to recent fully- and weakly-supervised methods on three diverse and challenging datasets: HICO-DET for human-object interaction, Visual Relationship Detection for generic object-to-object relations, and UnRel for unusual triplets; demonstrating robustness to non-comprehensive annotations and good few-shot generalization.\"",

        "abstract": "Learning a good image prior is a long-term goal for image restoration and manipulation. While existing methods like deep image prior (DIP) capture low-level image statistics, there are still gaps toward an image prior that captures rich image semantics including color, spatial coherence, textures, and high-level concepts. This work presents an effective way to exploit the image prior captured by a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on large-scale natural images. As shown in Fig.1, the deep generative prior (DGP) provides compelling results to restore missing semantics, e.g., color, patch, resolution, of various degraded images. It also enables diverse image manipulation including random jittering, image morphing, and category transfer. Such highly flexible effects are made possible through relaxing the assumption of existing GAN-inversion methods, which tend to fix the generator. Notably, we allow the generator to be fine-tuned on-the-fly in a progressive manner regularized by feature distance obtained by the discriminator in GAN. We show that these easy-to-implement and practical changes help preserve the reconstruction to remain in the manifold of nature image, and thus lead to more precise and faithful reconstruction for real images.

        "abstract": "While supervised techniques in re-identification are extremely effective, the need for large amounts of annotations makes them impractical for large camera networks. One-shot re-identification, which uses a singular labeled tracklet for each identity along with a pool of unlabeled tracklets, is a potential candidate towards reducing this labeling effort. Current one-shot re-identification methods function by modeling the inter-relationships amongst the labeled and the unlabeled data, but fail to fully exploit such relationships that exist within the pool of unlabeled data itself. In this paper, we propose a new framework named Temporal Consistency Progressive Learning, which uses temporal coherence as a novel self-supervised auxiliary task in the one-shot learning paradigm to capture such relationships amongst the unlabeled tracklets. Optimizing two new losses, which enforce consistency on a local and global scale, our framework can learn learn richer and more discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on two challenging video re-identification datasets - MARS and DukeMTMC-VideoReID - demonstrate that our proposed method is able to estimate the true labels of the unlabeled data more accurately by up to $8\\%$, and obtain significantly better re-identification performance compared to the existing state-of-the-art techniques.\"",

MCA extends traditional Codec Avatars (CA) by replacing the holistic models with a learned modular representation. It is important to note that traditional person-specific CAs are learned from few training samples, and typically lack robustness as well as limited expressiveness when transferring facial expressions. MCAs solve these issues by learning a modulated adaptive blending of different facial components as well as an exemplar-based latent alignment. We demonstrate that MCA achieves improved expressiveness and robustness w.r.t to CA in a variety of real-world datasets and practical scenarios.

In the extracting stage, we design square windows with a side length of a power of two, named power-window, to extract regional attributes by calculating boundary clearness of objects in the window. The larger windows are for the central regions and the smaller ones correspond to the peripheral regions. In the merging stage, power-windows are merged according to the defined attraction between them.

        "abstract": "We propose and study a method called FLOT that estimates scene flow on point clouds. We start the design of FLOT by noticing that scene flow estimation on point clouds reduces to estimating a permutation matrix in a perfect world. Inspired by recent works on graph matching, we build a method to find these correspondences by borrowing tools from optimal transport. Then, we relax the transport constraints to take into account real-world imperfections. The transport cost between two points is given by the pairwise similarity between deep features extracted by a neural network trained under full supervision using synthetic datasets. Our main finding is that FLOT can perform as well as the best existing methods on synthetic and real-world datasets while requiring much less parameters and without using multiscale analysis. Our second finding is that, on the training datasets considered, most of the performance can be explained by the learned transport cost. This yields a simpler method, FLOT$_0$, which is obtained using a particular choice of optimal transport parameters and performs nearly as well as FLOT.\"",

However, low-bit DNNs are often difficult to optimize due to the the saddle points in loss surfaces. Here we introduce a novel feature-based knowledge transfer framework, which utilizes a 32-bit DNN to guide the training of a low-bit DNN via feature maps. It is challenge because feature maps from two branches lie in continuous and discrete space respectively, and such mismatch has not been handled properly by existing feature transfer frameworks. In this paper, we propose to directly transfer information-rich continuous-space feature to the low-bit branch. To alleviate the negative impacts brought by the feature quantizer during the transfer process, we make two branches interact via centered cosine distance rather than the widely-used p-norms. Extensive experiments are conducted on Cifar10/100 and ImageNet. Compared with low-bit models trained directly, the proposed framework brings 0.5% to 3.4% accuracy gains to three different quantization schemes. Besides, the proposed framework can also be combined with other techniques, e.g. logits transfer, for further enhacement.\"",

Most existing FAS methods capture various cues (e.g., texture, depth and reflection) to distinguish the live faces from the spoofing faces. All these cues are based on the discrepancy among physical materials (e.g., skin, glass, paper and silicone). In this paper we rephrase face anti-spoofing as a material recognition problem and combine it with classical human material perception, intending to extract discriminative and robust features for FAS. To this end, we propose the Bilateral Convolutional Networks (BCN), which is able to capture intrinsic material-based patterns via aggregating multi-level bilateral macro- and micro- information. Furthermore, Multi-level Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and multi-head supervision are utilized to learn more robust features. Comprehensive experiments are performed on six benchmark datasets, and the proposed method achieves superior performance on both intra- and cross-dataset testings. One highlight is that we achieve overall 11.3$\\pm$9.5\\% EER for cross-type testing in SiW-M dataset, which significantly outperforms previous results. We hope this work will facilitate future cooperation between FAS and material communities. \"",

In this paper, we propose a novel face super-resolution method that explicitly incorporates 3D facial priors which grasp the sharp facial structures. Our work is the first to explore 3D morphable knowledge based on the fusion of parametric descriptions of face attributes (e.g., identity, facial expression, texture, illumination, and face pose). Furthermore, the priors can easily be incorporated into any networks and are extremely efficient in improving the performance and accelerating the convergence speed. Firstly, a 3D face rendering branch is set up to obtain 3D priors of salient facial structures and identity knowledge. Secondly, the Spatial Attention Module is used to better exploit this hierarchical information (i.e., intensity similarity, 3D facial structure, and identity content) for the super-resolution problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed 3D priors achieve superior face super-resolution results over the state-of-the-arts.\"",

Through experiments, we show that if either of two conditions is broken, the collapse disappears. Thereby, we present a novel approach called Fair DARTS where the exclusive competition is relaxed to be collaborative. Specifically, we let each operation's architectural weight be independent of others. Yet there is still an important issue of discretization discrepancy. We then propose a zero-one loss to push architectural weights towards zero or one, which approximates an expected multi-hot solution.

It is now accepted that because of biases in the datasets we present to the models, a fairness-oblivious training will lead to unfair models. An interesting topic is the study of mechanisms via which the de novo design or training of the model can be informed by fairness measures. Here, we study mechanisms that impose fairness concurrently while training the model. While existing fairness based approaches in vision have largely relied on training adversarial modules together with the primary classification/regression task, in an effort to remove the influence of the protected attribute or variable, we show how ideas based on well-known optimization concepts can provide a simpler alternative. In our proposed scheme, imposing fairness just requires specifying the protected attribute and utilizing our optimization routine. We provide a detailed technical analysis and present experiments demonstrating that various fairness measures from the literature can be reliably imposed on a number of training tasks in vision in a manner that is interpretable.\"",

In the training stage, we train the network via meta-learning; thus, the network can quickly adapt to any input image at test time. Then, in the test stage, parameters of this meta-learned network are rapidly fine-tuned with only a few iterations by only using the given low-resolution image. The adaptation at the test time takes full advantage of patch-recurrence property observed in natural images.

Its accuracy is on par with the most accurate, time-consuming online-learning model, while its speed is similar to the fastest template-matching method with sub-optimal accuracy. The core component of the model is a novel global context module that effectively summarizes and propagates information through the entire video. Compared to previous approaches that only use one frame or a few frames to guide the segmentation of the current frame, the global context module uses all past frames. Unlike the previous state-of-the-art space-time memory network that caches a memory at each spatio-temporal position, the global context module uses a fixed-size feature representation. Therefore, it uses constant memory regardless of the video length and costs substantially less memory and computation. With the novel module, our model achieves top performance on standard benchmarks at a real-time speed.\"",

Recently, several studies have shown that augmentation strategies found by search algorithms outperform hand-made strategies. Such methods employ black-box search algorithms over image transformations with continuous or discrete parameters and require a long time to obtain better strategies. In this paper, we propose a differentiable policy search pipeline for data augmentation, which is much faster than previous methods. We introduce approximate gradients for several transformation operations with discrete parameters as well as a differentiable mechanism for selecting operations. As the objective of training, we minimize the distance between the distributions of augmented and original data, which can be differentiated.

        "abstract": "Fast person re-identification (ReID) aims to search person images quickly and accurately. The main idea of recent fast ReID methods is the hashing algorithm, which learns compact binary codes and performs fast Hamming distance and counting sort. However, a very long code is needed for high accuracy (e.g. 2048), which compromises search speed. In this work, we introduce a new solution for fast ReID by formulating a novel Coarse-to-Fine (CtF) hashing code search strategy, which complementarily uses short and long codes, achieving both faster speed and better accuracy. It uses shorter codes to coarsely rank broad matching similarities and longer codes to refine only a few top candidates for more accurate instance ReID. Specifically, we design an All-in-One (AiO) framework together with a Distance Threshold Optimization (DTO) algorithm. In AiO, we simultaneously learn and enhance multiple codes of different lengths in a single model. It learns multiple codes in a pyramid structure, and encourage shorter codes to mimic longer codes by self-distillation. DTO solves a complex threshold search problem by a simple optimization process, and the balance between accuracy and speed is easily controlled by a single parameter. It formulates the optimization target as a $F_{eta}$ score that can be optimised by Gaussian cumulative distribution functions. Experimental results on 2 datasets show that our proposed method (CtF) is not only 8% more accurate but also 5x faster than contemporary hashing ReID methods. Compared with non-hashing ReID methods, CtF is 50x faster with comparable accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/wangguanan/light-reid.\"",

In this paper, we propose a novel learned feature-based refinement and augmentation method that produces a varied set of complex transformations. Importantly, these transformations also use information from both within-class and across-class prototypical representations that we extract through clustering. We use features already computed across iterations by storing them in a memory bank, obviating the need for significant extra computation. These transformations, combined with traditional image-based augmentation, are then used as part of the consistency-based regularization loss. We demonstrate that our method is comparable to current state of art for smaller datasets (CIFAR-10 and SVHN) while being able to scale up to larger datasets such as CIFAR-100 and mini-Imagenet where we achieve significant gains over the state of art ( extit{e.g.,} absolute 17.44\\% gain on mini-ImageNet).

From this perspective, we systematically analyze the distillation mechanism and demonstrate that the L2-norm of the feature in penultimate layer would be too large under the influence of label noise, and the temperature T in KD could be regarded as a correction factor for L2-norm to suppress the impact of noise. Noticing different samples suffer from varying intensities of label noise, we further propose a simple yet effective feature normalized knowledge distillation which introduces the sample specific correction factor to replace the unified temperature T for better reducing the impact of noise.

Conventionally, spatial contexts are passively hidden in the CNN's increasing receptive fields or actively encoded by non-local convolution. Yet, the non-local spatial interactions are not across scales, and thus they fail to capture the non-local contexts of objects (or parts) residing in different scales. To this end, we propose a fully active feature interaction across both space and scales, called Feature Pyramid Transformer (FPT). It transforms any feature pyramid into another feature pyramid of the same size but with richer contexts, by using three specially designed transformers in self-level, top-down, and bottom-up interaction fashion. FPT serves as a generic visual backbone with fair computational overhead. We conduct extensive experiments in both instance-level (i.e., object detection and instance segmentation) and pixel-level segmentation tasks, using various backbones and head networks, and observe consistent improvement over all the baselines and the state-of-the-art methods.\"",

Instead, we only intend to transfer the relevant textures from reference images to the output super-resolution image. To this end, we engaged neural texture transfer to swap texture features between the low-resolution image and the high-resolution reference image. We identify the importance of designing a super-resolution task-specific features rather than classification oriented features for neural texture transfer, making the feature extractor more compatible with the image synthesis task. We develop an end-to-end training framework for the reference-based super-resolution task, where the feature encoding network prior to matching and swapping is jointly trained with the image synthesis network. We also discover that learning the high-frequency residual is an effective way for the reference-based super-resolution task. Without bells and whistles, the proposed method E2ENT2 achieved better performance than state-of-the method (i.e., SRNTT with five loss functions) with only two basic loss functions. Extensive experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed method E2ENT2 can achieve superior performance to existing best models both quantitatively and qualitatively.\"",

We introduce the democratized graph attention mechanism, which can activate more pixels on the object to establish a robust correspondence between support and query images. Thus, the network is able to propagate more guiding information of foreground objects from support to query images, enhancing its robustness and generalizability to new objects. Furthermore, we propose multi-scale guidance by designing a refinement fusion unit to fuse features from intermediate layers for the segmentation of the query image. This offers an efficient way of leveraging multi-level semantic information to achieve more accurate segmentation. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed DAN achieves the new state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the previous methods by large margins. The thorough ablation studies further reveal its great effectiveness for few-shot semantic segmentation.\"",

        "abstract": "The impressive performance of deep convolutional neural networks in single-view 3D reconstruction suggests that these models perform non-trivial reasoning about the 3D structure of the output space. However, recent work has challenged this belief, showing that complex encoder-decoder architectures perform similarly to nearest-neighbor baselines or simple linear decoder models that exploit large amounts of per category data in standard benchmarks. On the other hand settings where 3D shape must be inferred for new categories with few examples are more natural and require models that generalize about shapes. In this work we demonstrate experimentally that naive baselines do not apply when the goal is to learn to reconstruct novel objects using very few examples, and that in a mph{few-shot} learning setting, the network must learn concepts that can be applied to new categories, avoiding rote memorization. To address deficiencies in existing approaches to this problem, we propose three approaches that efficiently integrate a class prior into a 3D reconstruction model, allowing to account for intra-class variability and imposing an implicit compositional structure that the model should learn. Experiments on the popular ShapeNet database demonstrate that our method significantly outperform existing baselines on this task in the few-shot setting.\"",

We build on a C3D encoder for spatio-temporal video blocks to capture short-range action patterns. Such encoded blocks are aggregated by permutation-invariant pooling to make our approach robust to varying action lengths and long-range temporal dependencies whose patterns are unlikely to repeat even in clips of the same class. Subsequently, the pooled representations are combined into simple relation descriptors which encode so-called query and support clips. Finally, relation descriptors are fed to the comparator with the goal of similarity learning between query and support clips. Importantly, to re-weight block contributions during pooling, we exploit spatial and temporal attention modules and self-supervision. In naturalistic clips (of the same class) there exists a temporal distribution shift--the locations of discriminative temporal action hotspots vary. Thus, we permute blocks of a clip and align the resulting attention regions with similarly permuted attention regions of non-permuted clip to train the attention mechanism invariant to block (and thus long-term hotspot) permutations. Our method outperforms the state of the art on the HMDB51, UCF101, miniMIT datasets.\"",

Despite the remarkable success of existing font generation methods, they have significant drawbacks; they require a large number of reference images to generate a new font set, or they fail to capture detailed styles with only a few samples. In this paper, we focus on compositional scripts, a widely used letter system in the world, where each glyph can be decomposed by several components. By utilizing the compositionality of compositional scripts, we propose a novel font generation framework, named Dual Memory-augmented Font Generation Network (DM-Font), which enables us to generate a high-quality font library with only a few samples. We employ memory components and global-context awareness in the generator to take advantage of the compositionality. In the experiments on Korean-handwriting fonts and Thai-printing fonts, we observe that our method generates a significantly better quality of samples with faithful stylization compared to the state-of-the-art generation methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

While conventional methods were successful in various tasks such as color and texture transfer between images, none could effectively work with the custom filter effects that are applied by users through various platforms like Instagram. In this paper, we introduce a new concept of style transfer, Filter Style Transfer (FST). Unlike conventional style transfer, new technique FST can extract and transfer custom filter style from a filtered style image to a content image. FST first infers the original image from a filtered reference via image-to-image translation. Then it estimates filter parameters from the difference between them. To resolve the ill-posed nature of reconstructing the original image from the reference, we represent each pixel color of an image to class mean and deviation. Besides, to handle the intra-class color variation, we propose an uncertainty based weighted least square method for restoring an original image. To the best of our knowledge, FST is the first style transfer method that can transfer custom filter effects between FHD image under 2ms on a mobile device without any textual context loss.\"",

Objects in 3D repositories like ShapeNet are labeled, but regrettably only in isolation, so without context. 3D scenes can be acquired by range scanners on city-level scale, but much fewer with semantic labels. Addressing this disparity, we introduce a new optimization procedure, which allows training for 3D detection with raw 3D scans while using as little as 5\\,\\% of the object labels and still achieve comparable performance. Our optimization uses two networks. A scene network maps an entire 3D scene to a set of 3D object centers. As we assume the scene not to be labeled by centers, no classic loss, such as Chamfer can be used to train it. Instead, we use another network to emulate the loss. This loss network is trained on a small labeled subset and maps a non-centered 3D object in the presence of distractions to its own center. This function is very similar -- and hence can be used instead of -- the gradient the supervised loss would provide. Our evaluation documents competitive fidelity at a much lower level of supervision, respectively higher quality at comparable supervision.

To address this limitation, Class Activation Map (CAM) provides an attractive solution that visualizes class-specific discriminative regions in an input image. The remarkable ability of CAMs to locate class discriminating regions has been exploited in weakly-supervised segmentation and localization tasks. In this work, we explore a new direction towards the possible use of CAM in deep network learning process. We note that such visualizations lend insights into the workings of deep CNNs and could be leveraged to introduce additional constraints during the learning stage. Specifically, the CAMs for negative classes (negative CAMs) often have false activations even though those classes are absent from an image. Thereby, we propose a loss function that seeks to minimize peaks within the negative CAMs, called Homogeneous Negative CAM loss. This way, in an effort to fix localization errors, our loss provides an extra supervisory signal that helps the model to better discriminate between similar classes. Our designed loss function is easy to implement and can be readily integrated into existing DNNs. We evaluate it on a number of classification tasks including large-scale recognition, multi-label classification and fine-grained recognition. Our loss provides better performance compared to other loss functions across the studied tasks. Additionally, we show that the proposed loss function provides higher robustness against adversarial attacks and noisy labels. \"",

Most existing methods either ignore how the camera wearer interacts with objects, or simply considers body motion as a separate modality. In contrast, we observe that the intentional hand movement reveals critical information about the future activity. Motivated by this observation, we adopt intentional hand movement as a feature representation, and propose a novel deep network that jointly models and predicts the egocentric hand motion, interaction hotspots and future action. Specifically, we consider the future hand motion as the motor attention, and model this attention using probabilistic variables in our deep model. The predicted motor attention is further used to select the discriminative spatial-temporal visual features for predicting actions and interaction hotspots. We present extensive experiments demonstrating the benefit of the proposed joint model. Importantly, our model produces new state-of-the-art results for action anticipation on both EGTEA Gaze+ and the EPIC-Kitchens datasets.

We introduce a new bound on how much information can be extracted per query about the forgotten cohort from a black-box network for which only the input-output behavior is observed. The proposed forgetting procedure has a deterministic part derived from the differential equations of a linearized version of the model, and a stochastic part that ensures information destruction by adding noise tailored to the geometry of the loss landscape. We exploit the connections between the final activations and weight dynamics of a DNN inspired by Neural Tangent Kernels to compute the information in the final activations.\"",

Based on this depth map, a recurrent encoder-decoder network processes reprojected features from nearby views and synthesizes the new view. Our network does not need to be optimized for a given scene. After training on a dataset, it works in previously unseen environments with no fine-tuning or per-scene optimization.

We propose a freeform structured light system that does not rigidly constrain camera(s) to the projector. By introducing an optimized phase-coded aperture in the projector, we transform the projector pattern to encode depth in its defocus robustly; this allows a camera to estimate depth, in projector coordinates, using local information. Additionally, we project a Kronecker-multiplexed pattern that provides global context to establish correspondence between camera and projector pixels. Together with aperture coding and projected pattern, the projector offers a unique 3D labeling for every location of the scene. The projected pattern can be observed in part or full by any camera, to reconstruct both the 3D map of the scene and the camera pose in the projector coordinates. This system is optimized using a fully differentiable rendering model and a CNN-based reconstruction. We build a prototype and demonstrate high-quality 3D reconstruction with an unconstrained camera, for both dynamic scenes and multi-camera systems.\"",

Our method achieves competitive shadow removal results compared to state-of-the-art methods that are trained with fully paired shadow and shadow-free images.

This paper combines zero-distribution of AoP, the difference of Degree of linear Polarization (DoP), and the edge information to segment the road region in the scene.

In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional network (FCN) for online SLR to concurrently learn spatial and temporal features from weakly annotated video sequences with only sentence-level annotations given. A gloss feature enhancement (GFE) module is introduced in the proposed network to enforce better sequence alignment learning. The proposed network is end-to-end trainable without any pre-training.

The key idea behind our approach is storing network weights \"\"in-pixel\"\" within the PEs of the PPA sensor itself to allow various computations, such as multiple different image convolutions, to be carried out in parallel. Our approach can perform convolutional layers, max pooling, ReLu, and a final fully connected layer entirely upon the PPA sensor, while leaving no untapped computational resources. This is in contrast to previous works that only use a sensor-level processing to sequentially compute image convolutions, and must transfer data to an external digital processor to complete the computation. We demonstrate our approach on the SCAMP-5 vision system, performing inference of a MNIST digit classification network at over 3000 frames per second and over 93% classification accuracy. This is the first work demonstrating CNN inference conducted entirely upon the processor array of a PPA vision sensor device, requiring no external processing.\"",

Our model, called generative low-dimensional background model (G-LBM) admits variational operations on the distribution of the manifold coordinates and simultaneously generates a low-rank structure of the latent manifold given the data. Therefore, our probabilistic model contains the intuition of the non-probabilistic low-dimensional manifold learning. G-LBM selects the intrinsic dimensionality of the underling manifold of the observations, and its probabilistic nature models the noise in the observation data. G-LBM has direct application in the background scenes model estimation from video sequences and we have evaluated its performance on SBMnet-2016 and BMC2012 datasets, where it achieved a performance higher or comparable to other state-of-the-art methods while being agnostic to the background scenes in videos. Besides, in challenges such as camera jitter and background motion, G-LBM is able to robustly estimate the background by effectively modeling the uncertainties in video observations in these scenarios.\"",

        "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have gained increasing popularity in various computer vision applications, and recently start to be deployed to resource-constrained mobile devices. Similar to other deep models, state-of-the-art GANs also suffer from high parameter complexities. That has recently motivated the exploration of compressing GANs (usually generators). Compared to the vast literature and prevailing success in compressing deep classifiers, the study of GAN compression remains in its infancy, so far leveraging individual compression techniques instead of more sophisticated combinations. We observe that due to the notorious instability of training GANs, heuristically stacking different compression techniques will result in unsatisfactory results. To this end, we propose the first end-to-end optimization framework combining multiple compression means for GAN compression, dubbed GAN Slimming (GS). GS seamlessly integrates three mainstream compression techniques: model distillation, channel pruning and quantization, together with the GAN minimax objective, into one unified optimization form, that can be efficiently optimized from end to end. Without bells and whistles, GS largely outperforms existing options in compressing image-to-image translation GANs. Specifically, we apply GS to compress CartoonGAN, a state-of-the-art style transfer network, by up to $47 imes$ times, with minimal visual quality degradation. Codes and pre-trained models can be found at https://github.com/TAMU-VITA/GAN-Slimming.\"",

For such application requirements, it is important to have a general cloth model that can represent a diverse set of garments. Previous studies often make certain assumptions about the garment, such as the topology or suited body shape. We propose a unified method using the generative network. Our model is applicable to different garment topologies with different sewing patterns and fabric materials. We also develop a novel image representation of garment models, and a reliable mapping algorithm between the general garment model and the image representation that can regularize the data representation of the cloth. Using this special intermediate image representation, the generated garment model can be easily retargeted to another body, enabling garment customization. In addition, a large garment appearance dataset is provided for use in garment reconstruction, garment capturing, and other applications. We demonstrate that our generative model has high reconstruction accuracy and can provide rich variations of virtual garments.\"",

Our network is trained on unpaired images from the two domains only, without any in-between images. All hops are produced using a single generator along each direction. In addition to the standard cycle-consistency and adversarial losses, we introduce a new hybrid discriminator, which is trained to classify the intermediate images produced by the generator as weighted hybrids, with weights based on a predetermined hop count. We also add a smoothness term to constrain the magnitude of each hop, further regularizing the translation.

In this work, we take a step closer to producing realistic and varied artificially rendered handwritten words.

Our generator is guided by three complementary learning objectives: to produce realistic images, to imitate a certain handwriting style and to convey a specific textual content. Our model is unconstrained to any predefined vocabulary, being able to render whatever input word. Given a sample writer, it is also able to mimic its calligraphic features in a few-shot setup.

Based on this theorem, we design four self-learning tasks with the constraints of transformation invariance, separability maximization, entropy analysis, and attention mapping. Specifically, the transformation invariance and separability maximization tasks learn the relations between samples. The entropy analysis task aims to avoid trivial solutions. To capture the object-oriented semantics, we design a self-supervised attention mechanism that includes a Gaussian attention module and a soft-attention loss. Moreover, we design a two-step learning algorithm that is memory-efficient for clustering large-size images.

Our formulation takes inspiration from the open-set recognition problem where test scenarios do not necessarily belong to the training distribution. We also discuss various quirks and assumptions encoded in recently proposed approaches for CL. We argue that some oversimplify the problem to an extent that leaves it with very little practical importance, and makes it extremely easy to perform well on. To validate this, we propose GDumb that (1) greedily stores samples in memory as they come and; (2) at test time, trains a model from scratch using samples only in the memory. We show that even though GDumb is not specifically designed for CL problems, it obtains state-of-the-art accuracies (often with large margins) in almost all the experiments when compared to a multitude of recently proposed algorithms. Surprisingly, it outperforms approaches in CL formulations for which they were specifically designed. This, we believe, raises concerns regarding our progress in CL for classification. Overall, we hope our formulation, characterizations and discussions will help in designing realistically useful CL algorithms, and GDumb will serve as a strong contender for the same.\"",

The GI unit is capable of enhancing feature representations of convolution networks over high-level semantics and learning the semantic coherency adaptively to each sample. Specifically, the dataset-based linguistic knowledge is first incorporated in the GI unit to promote context reasoning over the visual graph, then the evolved representations of the visual graph are mapped to each local representation to enhance the discriminated capability for scene parsing. GI unit is further improved by the SC-loss to enhance the semantic representations over the exemplar-based semantic graph. We perform full ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in our approach.

While \"\"grasping\"\" is commonly thought of as a single hand stably lifting an object, we capture the motion of the entire body and adopt the generalized notion of \"\"whole-body grasps\"\". Thus, we collect a new dataset, called GRAB (GRasping Actions with Bodies), of whole-body grasps, containing full 3D shape and pose sequences of 10 subjects interacting with 51 everyday objects of varying shape and size. Given MoCap markers, we fit the full 3D body shape and pose, including the articulated face and hands, as well as the 3D object pose. This gives detailed 3D meshes over time, from which we compute contact between the body and object. This is a unique dataset, that goes well beyond existing ones for modeling and understanding how humans grasp and manipulate objects, how their full body is involved, and how interaction varies with the task. We illustrate the practical value of GRAB with an example application; we train GrabNet, a conditional generative network, to predict 3D hand grasps for unseen 3D object shapes.

Mainstream methods (e.g., PCN and TopNet) use Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs) to directly process point clouds, which may cause the loss of details because the structural and context of point clouds are not fully considered. To solve this problem, we introduce 3D grids as intermediate representations to regularize unordered point clouds. We therefore propose a novel Gridding Residual Network (GRNet) for point cloud completion. In particular, we devise two novel differentiable layers, named Gridding and Gridding Reverse, to convert between point clouds and 3D grids without losing structural information. We also present the differentiable Cubic Feature Sampling layer to extract features of neighboring points, which preserves context information. In addition, we design a new loss function, namely Gridding Loss, to calculate the L1 distance between the 3D grids of the predicted and ground truth point clouds, which is helpful to recover details. Experimental results indicate that the proposed GRNet performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on the ShapeNet, Completion3D, and KITTI benchmarks.\"",

        "abstract": "Single image 3D shape interpretation and reconstruction are closely related to each other but have long been studied separately and often end up with priors that are highly biased by training classes. Here we present an algorithm extit{(GSIR)}, designed to joint learning these two tasks to capture generic, class-agnostic shape priors for a better understanding of 3D geometry. We propose to recover 3D shape structures as cuboids from partially reconstructed objects and use the predicted structures to further guide 3D reconstruction. The unified framework is trained simultaneously offline to learn a generic notion and can be fine-tuned online for specific objects without any annotations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate that introducing 3D shape interpretation improves the performance of 3D reconstruction and vice versa, against the state-of-the-art algorithms on both seen and unseen categories.\"",

This dense mesh representation further leads us to consider geometrical consistency and scene context, and inspires a new multi-objective loss function to regularize network training, which in turn improves the accuracy of 6D pose estimation and validates the merit of jointly performing both tasks.

We then exploit the analytical expression of Gabor filters to derive a compact expression for a Lipschitz constant of such filters, and harness this theoretical result to develop a regularizer we use during training to further enhance network robustness. We conduct extensive experiments with various architectures (LeNet, AlexNet, VGG16, and WideResNet) on several datasets (MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) and demonstrate large empirical robustness gains.

        "abstract": "Gait recognition aims at identifying different people by the walking patterns, which can be conducted at a long distance without the cooperation of subjects. A key challenge for gait recognition is to learn representations from the silhouettes that are invariant to the factors such as clothing, carrying conditions and camera viewpoints. Besides being discriminative for identification, the gait representations should also be compact for storage to keep millions of subjects registered in the gallery. In this work, we propose a novel network named Gait Lateral Network (GLN) which can learn both discriminative and compact representations from the silhouettes for gait recognition. Specifically, GLN leverages the inherent feature pyramid in deep convolutional neural networks to enhance the gait representations. The silhouette-level and set-level features extracted by different stages are merged with the lateral connections in a top-down manner. Besides, GLN is equipped with a Compact Block which can significantly reduce the dimension of the gait representations without hindering the accuracy. Extensive experiments on CASIA-B and OUMVLP show that GLN can achieve state-of-the-art performance using the $256$-dimensional representations. Under the most challenging condition of walking in different clothes on CASIA-B, our method improves the rank-1 accuracy by $6.45\\%$.\"",

To mitigate large intra-subject variations caused by a phase (gait pose) difference between a matching pair of input single images, we first reconstruct full gait cycles of image sequences from the single images using an auto-encoder framework, and then feed them into a state-of-the-art gait recognition network for matching. Specifically, a phase estimation network is introduced for the input single image, and the gait cycle reconstruction network exploits the estimated phase to mitigate the dependence of an encoded feature on the phase of that single image. This is called phase-aware gait cycle reconstructor (PA-GCR). In the training phase, the PA-GCR and recognition network are simultaneously optimized to achieve a good trade-off between reconstruction and recognition accuracies. Experiments on three gait datasets demonstrate the significant performance improvement of this method.\"",

Inspired by billboards and geometric proxies used in computer graphics, this paper proposes Generative Latent Textured Objects (GeLaTO), a compact representation that combines a set of coarse shape proxies defining low frequency geometry with learned neural textures, to encode both medium and fine scale geometry as well as view-dependent appearance. To generate the proxies' textures, we learn a joint latent space allowing category-level appearance and geometry interpolation. The proxies are independently rasterized with their corresponding neural texture and composited using a U-Net, which generates an output photorealistic image including an alpha map. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by reconstructing complex objects from a sparse set of views. We show results on a dataset of real images of eyeglasses frames, which are particularly challenging to reconstruct using classical methods. We also demonstrate that these coarse proxies can be handcrafted when the underlying object geometry is easy to model, like eyeglasses, or generated using a neural network for more complex categories, such as cars.\"",

The method, inspired by the latest state-of-the-art 3D-LaneNet, is a unified framework solving image encoding, spatial transform of features and 3D lane prediction in a single network. However, we propose unique designs for Gen-LaneNet in two folds. First, we introduce a new geometry-guided lane anchor representation in a new coordinate frame and apply a specific geometric transformation to directly calculate real 3D lane points from the network output. We demonstrate that aligning the lane points with the underlying top-view features in the new coordinate frame is critical towards a generalized method in handling unfamiliar scenes. Second, we present a scalable two-stage framework that decouples the learning of image segmentation subnetwork and geometry encoding subnetwork. Compared to 3D-LaneNet, the proposed Gen-LaneNet drastically reduces the amount of 3D lane labels required to achieve a robust solution in real-world applications. Moreover, we release a new synthetic dataset and its construction strategy to encourage the development and evaluation of 3D lane detection methods. In experiments, we conduct extensive ablation study to substantiate the proposed Gen-LaneNet significantly outperforms 3D-LaneNet in average precision(AP) and F-measure.\"",

        "abstract": "Despite the impressive performance under the single-domain setup, current fully-supervised models for person re-identification (re-ID) degrade significantly when deployed to an unseen domain. According to the characteristics of cross-domain re-ID, such degradation is mainly attributed to the dramatic variation within the target domain and the severe shift between the source and target domain. To achieve a model that generalizes well to the target domain, it is desirable to take both issues into account. In terms of the former issue, one of the most successful solutions is to enforce consistency between nearest-neighbors in the embedding space. However, we find that the search of neighbors is highly biased due to the discrepancy across cameras. To this end, we improve the vanilla neighborhood invariance approach by imposing the constraint in a camera-aware manner. As for the latter issue, we propose a novel cross-domain mixup scheme. It alleviates the abrupt transfer by introducing the interpolation between the two domains as a transition state. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method. Without any auxiliary data or models, it outperforms existing state-of-the-arts by a large margin.

To avoid this problem, we propose a novel resolution adaption network (RAN) which contains Multi-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (MR-GAN) followed by a feature adaption network. MR-GAN learns multi-resolution representations and randomly selects one resolution to generate realistic low-resolution (LR) faces that can avoid the artifacts of down-sampled faces. A novel feature adaption network with translation gate is developed to fuse the discriminative information of the generated LR faces into backbone network, while preserving the discrimination ability of original face representations.

        "abstract": "Neural network quantization is an effective way to compress deep models and improve their execution latency and energy efficiency, so that they can be deployed on mobile or embedded devices. Existingquantization methods require original data for calibration or fine-tuning to get better performance. However, in many real-world scenarios, the data may not be available due to confidential or private issues, thereby making existing quantization methods not applicable. Moreover, due to the absence of original data, the recently developed generative adversarial networks (GANs) cannot be applied to generate data. Although the full-precision model may contain rich data information, such information alone is hard to exploit for recovering the original data or generating new meaningful data. In this paper, we investigate a simple-yet-effective method called Generative Low-bitwidth Data Free Quantization(GDFQ) to remove the data dependence burden. Specifically, we propose a knowledge matching generator to produce meaningful fake data by exploiting classification boundary knowledge and distribution information in the pre-trained model. With the help of generated data, we can quantize a model by learning knowledge from the pre-trained model. Extensive experiments on three data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. More critically, our method achieves much higher accuracy on4-bit quantization than the existing data free quantization method. Code is available at https://github.com/xushoukai/GDFQ.\"",

        "abstract": "3D object detection has been widely studied due to its potential applicability to many promising areas such as robotics and augmented reality. Yet, the sparse nature of the 3D data poses unique challenges to this task. Most notably, the observable surface of the 3D point clouds is disjoint from the center of the instance to ground the bounding box prediction on. To this end, we propose Generative Sparse Detection Network (GSDN), a fully-convolutional single-shot sparse detection network that efficiently generates the support for object proposals. The key component of our model is a generative sparse tensor decoder, which uses a series of transposed convolutions and pruning layers to expand the support of sparse tensors while discarding unlikely object centers to maintain minimal runtime and memory footprint. GSDN can process unprecedentedly large-scale inputs with a single fully-convolutional feed-forward pass, thus does not require the heuristic post-processing stage that stitches results from sliding windows as other previous methods have. We validate our approach on three 3D indoor datasets including the large-scale 3D indoor reconstruction dataset where our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a relative improvement of 7.14% while being 3.78 times faster than the best prior work.\"",

This situation is easily cause overfitting for general model. To address the challenges, we propose a novel View-Correlation Adaptation ( extit{VCA}) framework in semi-supervised fashion. A semi-supervised data augmentation method is designed to generate extra features and labels based on labeled and even unlabeled samples. In addition, a cross-view adversarial training strategy is proposed to explore the structural information from one view and help the representation learning of the other view.

In this work, we propose to incorporate geometric reasoning to deep learning for layout estimation. Our approach learns to infer the depth maps of the dominant planes in the scene by predicting the pixel-level surface parameters, and the layout can be generated by the intersection of the depth maps. Moreover, we present a new dataset with pixel-level depth annotation of dominant planes. It is larger than the existing datasets and contains both cuboid and non-cuboid rooms.

In contrast to previous methods, we make two main contributions: First, instead of comparing real-world images and synthetic renderings in the RGB or mask space, we compare them in a feature space optimized for 3D pose refinement. Second, we introduce a novel differentiable renderer that learns to approximate the rasterization backward pass from data instead of relying on a hand-crafted algorithm. For this purpose, we predict deep cross-domain correspondences between RGB images and 3D model renderings in the form of what we call geometric correspondence fields. These correspondence fields serve as pixel-level gradients which are analytically propagated backward through the rendering pipeline to perform a gradient-based optimization directly on the 3D pose. In this way, we precisely align 3D models to objects in RGB images which results in significantly improved 3D pose estimates. We evaluate our approach on the challenging Pix3D dataset and achieve up to 55% relative improvement compared to state-of-the-art refinement methods in multiple metrics.\"",

Unsupervised person ReID through domain adaptation is attractive yet challenging. Existing unsupervised ReID approaches often fail in correctly identifying the positive samples and negative samples through the distance-based matching/ranking. The two distributions of distances for positive sample pairs (Pos-distr) and negative sample pairs (Neg-distr) are often not well separated, having large overlap. To address this problem, we introduce a global distance-distributions separation (GDS) constraint over the two distributions to encourage the clear separation of positive and negative samples from a global view. We model the two global distance distributions as Gaussian distributions and push apart the two distributions while encouraging their sharpness in the unsupervised training process. Particularly, to model the distributions from a global view and facilitate the timely updating of the distributions and the GDS related losses, we leverage a momentum update mechanism for building and maintaining the distribution parameters (mean and variance) and calculate the loss on the fly during the training. Distribution-based hard mining is proposed to further promote the separation of the two distributions. We validate the effectiveness of the GDS constraint in unsupervised ReID networks. Extensive experiments on multiple ReID benchmark datasets show our method leads to significant improvement over the baselines and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.\"",

        "abstract": "In order to summarize a content video properly, it is important to grasp the sequential structure of video as well as the long-term dependency between frames. The necessity of them is more obvious, especially for unsupervised learning. One possible solution is to utilize a well-known technique in the field of natural language processing for long-term dependency and sequential property: self-attention with relative position embedding (RPE). However, compared to natural language processing, video summarization requires capturing a much longer length of the global context. In this paper, we therefore present a novel input decomposition strategy, which samples the input both globally and locally. This provides an effective temporal window for RPE to operate and improves overall computational efficiency significantly. By combining both Global-and-Local input decomposition and RPE together, we come up with GL-RPE. Our approach allows the network to capture both local and global interdependencies between video frames effectively. Since GL-RPE can be easily integrated into the existing methods, we apply it to two different unsupervised backbones. We provide extensive ablation studies and visual analysis to verify the effectiveness of the proposals. We demonstrate our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance using the recently proposed rank order-based metrics: Kendall's $ au$ and Spearman's $\rho$. Furthermore, despite our method is unsupervised, we show ours perform on par with the fully-supervised method.\"",

Vanishing point (VP) is the intersection of the image lines projected from parallel 3D lines.

Existing approaches are prone to missing partial inliers, rely on prior knowledge of the number of VPs, and/or lead to low efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose the novel mine-and-stab (MnS) algorithm and embed it in the branch-and-bound (BnB) algorithm. Different from BnB that iteratively branches the full parameter intervals, our MnS directly mines the narrow sub-intervals and then stabs them by probes. We simultaneously search for the vertical VP by BnB and horizontal VPs by MnS. The proposed collaboration between BnB and MnS guarantees global optimality in terms of maximizing the number of inliers. It can also automatically determine the number of VPs. Moreover, its efficiency is suitable for practical applications.

        "abstract": "Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that perform well in HDR conditions and have high temporal resolution. However, different from traditional frame-based cameras, event cameras measure asynchronous pixel-level brightness changes and return them in a highly discretised format, hence new algorithms are needed. The present paper looks at fronto-parallel motion estimation of an event camera. The flow of the events is modeled by a general homographic warping in a space-time volume, and the objective is formulated as a maximisation of contrast within the image of unwarped events. However, in stark contrast to prior art, we derive a globally optimal solution to this generally non-convex problem, and thus remove the dependency on a good initial guess. Our algorithm relies on branch-and-bound optimisation for which we derive novel, recursive upper and lower bounds for six different contrast estimation functions. The practical validity of our approach is supported by a highly successful application to AGV motion estimation with a downward facing event camera, a challenging scenario in which the sensor experiences fronto-parallel motion in front of noisy, fast moving textures.\"",

It has been shown that using the \ufb01rst and second order statistics (e.g., mean and variance) to perform Z-score standardization on network activations or weight vectors, such as batch normalization (BN) and weight standardization (WS), can improve the training performance. Di\ufb00erent from those previous methods that mostly operate on activations or weights, we present a new optimization technique, namely gradient centralization (GC), which operates directly on gradients by centralizing the gradient vectors to have zero mean. GC can be viewed as a projected gradient descent method with a constrained loss function. We show that GC can regularize both the weight space and output feature space so that it can boost the generalization performance of DNNs. Moreover, GC improves the Lipschitzness of the loss function and its gradient so that the training process becomes more e\ufb03cient and stable. GC is very simple to implement and can be easily embedded into existing gradient based DNN optimizers with only one line of code. It can also be directly used to \ufb01ne-tune the pre-trained DNNs. Our experiments on various applications, including general image classi\ufb01cation, \ufb01ne-grained image classi\ufb01cation, detection and segmentation, demonstrate that GC can consistently improve the performance of DNN learning.\"",

In addition, due to the lack of Co-SOD training data, we design a jigsaw training strategy, with which Co-SOD networks can be trained on general saliency datasets without extra pixel-level annotations. To evaluate the performance of Co-SOD methods on discovering the co-salient object among multiple foregrounds, we construct a challenging CoCA dataset, where each image contains at least one extraneous foreground along with the co-salient object. Experiments demonstrate that our GICD achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our codes and dataset are available at https://mmcheng.net/gicd/.\"",

Spectral graph filtering is introduced to encode graph signals, which are then embedded as probability distributions in a Wasserstein space, called graph Wasserstein metric learning. Such a seamless integration of graph signal filtering together with metric learning results in a surprise consistency on both learning processes, in which the goal of metric learning is just to optimize signal filters or vice versa. Further, we derive the solution of the graph comparison model as a classic generalized eigenvalue decomposition problem, which has an exactly closed-form solution. Finally, GWCA together with movie/text graphs generation are unified into the framework of movie retrieval to evaluate our proposed method. Extensive experiments on MovieGrpah dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our GWCA as well as the entire framework. \"",

For each class, the GCN is treated as a binary classifier, which learns to discriminate clean from noisy examples using a weighted binary cross-entropy loss function. The GCN-inferred \"\"clean\"\" probability is then exploited as a relevance measure. Each noisy example is weighted by its relevance when learning a classifier for the end task. We evaluate our method on an extended version of a few-shot learning problem, where the few clean examples of novel classes are supplemented with additional noisy data. Experimental results show that our GCN-based cleaning process significantly improves the classification accuracy over not cleaning the noisy data, as well as standard few-shot classification where only few clean examples are used.\"",

The final coordinates of keypoints are obtained by decoding heatmap directly. In this paper, we aim to find a better approach to get more accurate localization results. We mainly put forward two suggestions for improvement: 1) different features and methods should be applied for rough and accurate localization, 2) relationship between keypoints should be considered. Specifically, we propose a two-stage graph-based and model-agnostic framework, called Graph-PCNN, with a localization subnet and a graph pose refinement module added onto the original heatmap regression network. In the first stage, heatmap regression network is applied to obtain a rough localization result, and a set of proposal keypoints, called guided points, are sampled. In the second stage, for each guided point, different visual feature is extracted by the localization subnet. The relationship between guided points is explored by the graph pose refinement module to get more accurate localization results. Experiments show that Graph-PCNN can be used in various backbones to boost the performance by a large margin. Without bells and whistles, our best model can achieve a new state-of-the-art 76.8% AP on COCO test-dev split. \"",

This paper proposes a guessing state for the Guesser, and regards guess as a process with change of guessing state through a dialogue. A guessing state tracking based guess model is therefore proposed. The guessing state is defined as a distribution on objects in the image. With that in hand, two loss functions are defined as supervisions for model training. Early supervision brings supervision to Guesser at early rounds, and incremental supervision brings monotonicity to the guessing state.

        "abstract": "Completing a corrupted image with correct structures and reasonable textures for a mixed scene remains an elusive challenge. Since the missing hole in a mixed scene of a corrupted image often contains various semantic information, conventional two-stage approaches utilizing structural information often lead to the problem of unreliable structural prediction and ambiguous image texture generation. In this paper, we propose a Semantic Guidance and Evaluation Network (SGE-Net) to iteratively update the structural priors and the inpainted image in an interplay framework of semantics extraction and image inpainting. It utilizes semantic segmentation map as guidance in each scale of inpainting, under which location-dependent inferences are re-evaluated, and, accordingly, poorly-inferred regions are refined in subsequent scales. Extensive experiments on real-world images of mixed scenes demonstrated the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of clear boundaries and photo-realistic textures.\"",

Although SSL methods have achieved impressive results in image classification, the performances of applying them to pixel-wise tasks are unsatisfactory due to their need for dense outputs. In addition, existing pixel-wise SSL approaches are only suitable for certain tasks as they usually require to use task-specific properties. In this paper, we present a new SSL framework, named Guided Collaborative Training (GCT), for pixel-wise tasks, with two main technical contributions. First, GCT addresses the issues caused by the dense outputs through a novel flaw detector. Second, the modules in GCT learn from unlabeled data collaboratively through two newly proposed constraints that are independent of task-specific properties. As a result, GCT can be applied to a wide range of pixel-wise tasks without structural adaptation. Our extensive experiments on four challenging vision tasks, including semantic segmentation, real image denoising, portrait image matting, and night image enhancement, show that GCT outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods by a large margin.\"",

To address this limitation, in this study, we propose a guided deep decoder network as a general prior. The proposed network is composed of an encoder-decoder network that exploits multi-scale features of a guidance image and a deep decoder network that generates an output image. The two networks are connected by feature refinement units to embed the multi-scale features of the guidance image into the deep decoder network.

However, few studies have provided flexible solutions to re-identifying people in an image containing a partial occlusion body part. In this paper, we propose a simple occlusion-aware approach to address the problem. The proposed method first leverages a fully convolutional network to generate spatial features. And then we design a combination of a pose-guided and mask-guided layer to generate saliency heatmap to further guide discriminative feature learning. More importantly, we propose a new matching approach, called Guided Adaptive Spatial Matching (GASM), which expects that each spatial feature in the query can find the most similar spatial features of a person in a gallery to match. Especially, We use the saliency heatmap to guide the adaptive spatial matching by assigning the foreground human parts with larger weights adaptively. The effectiveness of the proposed GASM is demonstrated on two occluded person datasets: Crowd REID (51.52\\%) and Occluded REID (80.25\\%) and three benchmark person datasets: Market1501 (95.31\\%), DukeMTMC-reID (88.12\\%) and MSMT17 (79.52\\%).

We realize this idea with learning-based selection of confident matches from an initial set of all pairwise matching scores and their propagation by a new differentiable upsampling layer based on moving least square concept.

In this paper, we propose guiding depth estimation to favor planar structures that are ubiquitous especially in indoor environments. This is achieved by incorporating a non-local coplanarity constraint to the network with a novel attention mechanism called depth-attention volume (DAV).

The critical idea of H3DNet is to predict a hybrid set of geometric primitives, i.e., BB centers, BB face centers, and BB edge centers. We show how to convert the predicted geometric primitives into object proposals by defining a distance function between an object and the geometric primitives. This distance function enables continuous optimization of object proposals, and its local minimums provide high-fidelity object proposals. H3DNet then utilizes a matching and refinement module to classify object proposals into detected objects and fine-tune the geometric parameters of the detected objects. The hybrid set of geometric primitives not only provides more accurate signals for object detection than using a single type of geometric primitives, but it also provides an overcomplete set of constraints on the resulting 3D layout. Therefore, H3DNet can tolerate outliers in predicted geometric primitives. Our model achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection results on two large datasets with real 3D scans, ScanNet and SUN RGB-D.\"",

        "abstract": "There has been an explosive demand for bringing machine learning (ML) powered intelligence into numerous Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. However, the effectiveness of such intelligent functionality requires in-situ continuous model adaptation for adapting to new data and environments, while the on-device computing and energy resources are usually extremely constrained. Neither traditional hand-crafted (e.g., SGD, Adagrad, and Adam) nor existing meta optimizers are specifically designed to meet those challenges, as the former requires tedious hyper-parameter tuning while the latter are often costly due to the meta algorithms\u2019 own overhead. To this end, we propose hardware-aware learning to optimize (HALO), a practical meta optimizer dedicated to resource-efficient on-device adaptation. Our HALO optimizer features the following highlights: (1) faster adaptation speed (i.e., taking fewer data or iterations to reach a specified accuracy) by introducing a new regularizer to promote empirical generalization; and (2) lower per-iteration complexity, thanks to a stochastic structural sparsity regularizer being enforced. Furthermore, the optimizer itself is designed as a very light-weight RNN and thus incurs negligible overhead. Ablation studies and experiments on five datasets, six optimizees, and two state-of-the-art (SOTA) edge AI devices validate that, while always achieving a better accuracy (\u21910.46% - \u219120.28%), HALO can greatly trim down the energy cost (up to \u219360%) in adaptation, quantified using an IoT device or SOTA simulator.

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, Hybrid Generative Network (HGNet) for Zero-shot Domain Adaptation, which embeds an adaptive feature separation (AFS) module into generative architecture. Specifically, AFS module can adaptively distinguish classification-relevant features from classification-irrelevant ones to learn domain-invariant and discriminative representations when task-relevant target instances are invisible. To learn high-quality feature representation, we also develop hybrid generative strategy to ensure the uniqueness of feature separation and completeness of semantic information.

        "abstract": "Recent work in network quantization produced state-of-the-art results using mixed precision quantization. An imperative requirement for many efficient edge device hardware implementations is that their quantizers are uniform and with power-of-two thresholds. In this work, we introduce the Hardware Friendly Mixed Precision Quantization Block (HMQ) in order to meet this requirement. The HMQ is a mixed precision quantization block that repurposes the Gumbel-Softmax estimator into a smooth estimator of a pair of quantization parameters, namely, bit-width and threshold. HMQs use this to search over a finite space of quantization schemes. Empirically, we apply HMQs to quantize classification models trained on CIFAR10 and ImageNet. For ImageNet, we quantize four different architectures and show that, in spite of the added restrictions to our quantization scheme, we achieve competitive and, in some cases, state-of-the-art results.\"",

Although several 3D hand reconstruction approaches leverage hand models as a strong prior to resolve ambiguities and achieve more robust results, most existing models account only for the hand shape and poses and do not model the texture. To fill this gap, in this work we present HTML, the first parametric texture model of human hands. Our model spans several dimensions of hand appearance variability (e.g. related to gender, ethnicity, or age) and only requires a commodity camera for data acquisition. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our appearance model can be used to tackle a range of challenging problems such as 3D hand reconstruction from a single monocular image. Furthermore, our appearance model can be used to define a neural rendering layer that enables training with a self-supervised photometric loss. We make our model publicly available.\"",

Unlike conventional image inpainting task that works on images with only part of a visual instance missing, HVITA concerns scenarios where an object is completely absent from the scene. This seemingly minor difference in fact makes the HVITA a much challenging task, as the restoration algorithm would have to not only infer the category of the object in total absentia, but also hallucinate an object of which the appearance is consistent with the background. Towards solving HVITA, we propose an end-to-end deep approach that explicitly looks into the global semantics within the image. Specifically, we transform the input image to a semantic graph, wherein each node corresponds to a detected object in the scene. We then adopt a Graph Convolutional Network on top of the scene graph to estimate the category of the missing object in the masked region, and finally introduce a Generative Adversarial Module to carry out the hallucination. Experiments on COCO, Visual Genome and NYU Depth v2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach yields truly encouraging and visually plausible results.\"",

While most prior work focuses on synthetic input shapes, our formulation is designed to be applicable to real-world scans with imperfect input correspondences and various types of noise. To that end, we use recent progress on dynamic thin shell simulation and divergence-free shape deformation and combine them to address the inverse problem of finding a plausible intermediate sequence for two input shapes. In comparison to prior work that mainly focuses on small distortion of consecutive frames, we explicitly model volume preservation and momentum conservation, as well as an anisotropic local distortion model. We argue that, in order to get a robust interpolation for imperfect inputs, we need to model the input noise explicitly which results in an alignment based formulation. Finally, we show a qualitative and quantitative improvement over prior work on a broad range of synthetic and scanned data. Besides being more robust to noisy inputs, our method yields exactly volume preserving intermediate shapes, avoids self-intersections and is scalable to high resolution scans.\"",

To address this issue, we connect this structured output learning problem with the structured modeling framework in sequence transduction field. Standard transduction models like Transformer adopt an autoregressive connection to capture dependencies from previously generated tokens and further correlate this information with the input sequence in order to prioritize the set of relevant input tokens for current token generation. To borrow wisdom from this structured learning framework while avoiding the sequential modeling for hand pose, taking a 3D point set as input, we propose to leverage the Transformer architecture with a novel non-autoregressive structured decoding mechanism. Specifically, instead of using previously generated results, our decoder utilizes a reference hand pose to provide equivalent dependencies among hand joints for each output joint generation. By imposing the reference structural dependencies, we can correlate the information with the input 3D points through a multi-head attention mechanism, aiming to discover informative points from different perspectives, towards each hand joint localization. We demonstrate our model's effectiveness over multiple challenging hand pose datasets, comparing with several state-of-the-art methods.\"",

However, due to limitations in the descriptors, raw matches are often contaminated by a majority of outliers. As a result, outlier detection is a fundamental problem in computer vision and a wide range of approaches, from simple checks based on descriptor similarity to geometric verification, have been proposed over the last decades. In recent years, deep learning-based approaches to outlier detection have become popular. Unfortunately, the corresponding works rarely compare with strong classical baselines. In this paper we revisit handcrafted approaches to outlier filtering. Based on best practices, we propose a hierarchical pipeline for effective outlier detection as well as integrate novel ideas which in sum lead to an efficient and competitive approach to outlier rejection. We show that our approach, although not relying on learning, is more than competitive to both recent learned works as well as handcrafted approaches, both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.

The consensus of previous research is that optimizing with the extit{hardest} negative examples leads to bad training behavior. That's a problem -- these hardest negatives are literally the cases where the distance metric fails to capture semantic similarity. In this paper, we characterize the space of triplets and derive why hard negatives make triplet loss training fail. We offer a simple fix to the loss function and show that, with this fix, optimizing with hard negative examples becomes feasible.

To address this issue, we present a simple but effective Hierarchical Context Embedding (HCE) framework, which can be applied as a plug-and-play component, to facilitate the classification ability of a series of region-based detectors by mining contextual cues. Specifically, to advance the recognition of context-dependent object categories, we propose an image-level categorical embedding module which leverages the holistic image-level context to learn object-level concepts. Then, novel RoI features are generated by exploiting hierarchically embedded context information beneath both whole images and interested regions, which are also complementary to conventional RoI features. Moreover, to make full use of our hierarchical contextual RoI features, we propose the early-and-late fusion strategies (\\ie, feature fusion and confidence fusion), which can be combined to boost the classification accuracy of region-based detectors. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our HCE framework is flexible and generalizable, leading to significant and consistent improvements upon various region-based detectors, including FPN, Cascade R-CNN and Mask R-CNN.\"",

To alleviate it, we design a novel facial age prior to guide the aging mechanism modeling. To explore the age effects on facial images, we propose a Disentangled Adversarial Autoencoder (DAAE) to disentangle the facial images into three independent factors: age, identity and extraneous information. To avoid the \"\"wash away\"\" of age and identity information in face aging process, we propose a hierarchical conditional generator by passing the disentangled identity and age embeddings to the high-level and low-level layers with class-conditional BatchNorm. Finally, a disentangled adversarial learning mechanism is introduced to boost the image quality for face aging. In this way, when manipulating the age distribution, DAAE can achieve face aging with arbitrary ages. Further, given an input face image, the mean value of the learned age posterior distribution can be treated as an age estimator. These indicate that DAAE can efficiently and accurately estimate the age distribution by a disentangling manner. DAAE is the first attempt to achieve facial age analysis tasks, including face aging with arbitrary ages, exemplar-based face aging and age estimation, in an universal framework. The qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of DAAE on five popular datasets, including CACD2000, Morph, UTKFace, FG-NET and AgeDB.\"",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of estimating a parametric model of 3D human mesh from a single image. While there has been substantial recent progress in this area with direct regression of model parameters, these methods only implicitly exploit the human body kinematic structure, leading to sub-optimal use of the model prior. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a new technique for regression of human parametric model that is explicitly informed by the known hierarchical structure, including joint interdependencies of the model. This results in a strong prior-informed design of the regressor architecture and an associated hierarchical optimization that is flexible to be used in conjunction with the current standard frameworks for 3D human mesh recovery. We demonstrate these aspects by means of extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets, showing how our proposed new design outperforms several existing and popular methods, establishing new state-of-the-art results. By considering joint interdependencies, our method is equipped to infer joints even under data corruptions, which we demonstrate by conducting experiments under varying degrees of occlusion.\"",

        "abstract": "Generating diverse and natural behaviors is one of the long-standing goals for creating intelligent characters in the animated world. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method for generating long-range, diverse and plausible behaviors to achieve a specific goal location. Our proposed method learns to model the motion of human by decomposing a long-range generation task in a hierarchical manner. Given the starting and ending states, a memory bank is used to retrieve motion references as source material for short-range clip generation. We first propose to explicitly disentangle the provided motion material into style and content counterparts via bi-linear transformation modelling, where diverse synthesis is achieved by free-form combination of these two components. The short-range clips are then connected to form a long-range motion sequence. Without ground truth annotation, we propose a parameterized bi-directional interpolation scheme to guarantee the physical validity and visual naturalness of generated results. On large-scale skeleton dataset, we show that the proposed method is able to synthesise long-range, diverse and plausible motion, which is also generalizable to unseen motion data during testing. Moreover, we demonstrate the generated sequences are useful as subgoals for actual physical execution in the animated world.

        "abstract": "Generating photorealistic images of human faces at scale remains a prohibitively difficult task using computer graphics approaches. This is because these require the simulation of light to be photorealistic, which in turn requires physically accurate modelling of geometry, materials, and light sources, for both the head and the surrounding scene. Non-photorealistic renders however are increasingly easy to produce. In contrast to computer graphics approaches, generative models learned from more readily available 2D image data have been shown to produce samples of human faces that are hard to distinguish from real data. The process of learning usually corresponds to a loss of control over the shape and appearance of the generated images. For instance, even simple disentangling tasks such as modifying the hair independently of the face, which is trivial to accomplish in a computer graphics approach, remains an open research question. In this work, we propose an algorithm that matches a non-photorealistic, synthetically generated image to a latent vector of a pretrained StyleGAN2 model which, in turn, maps the vector to a photorealistic image of a person of the same pose, expression, hair, and lighting. In contrast to most previous work, we require no synthetic training data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm of its kind to work at a resolution of 1K and represents a significant leap forward in visual realism.\"",

Despite recent advances in disentangled representation learning, existing approaches often suffer from the trade-off between representation learning and generation performance (i.e. improving generation quality sacrifices disentanglement performance). We propose an Information-Distillation Generative Adversarial Network (ID-GAN), a simple yet generic framework that can easily incorporate the existing state-of-the-art models for both disentanglement learning and high-fidelity synthesis. Our method learns disentangled representation using VAE-based models, and distills the learned representation together with additional nuisance variable to the separate GAN-based generator for high-fidelity synthesis. To ensure that both generative models are aligned to render the same generative factors, we additionally constrain the GAN generator to maximize the mutual information between the learned latent code and the output. Despite the simplicity, we show that the proposed method is surprisingly effective, achieving comparable image generation quality to the state-of-the-arts using the disentangled representation. We also show that the proposed decomposition leads to efficient and stable model design, and demonstrate it on high-resolution image synthesis task (1024x1024 pixels) for the first time using the disentangled representations.\"",

To address this challenge, we propose an iterative inpainting method with a feedback mechanism. Specifically, we introduce a deep generative model which not only outputs an inpainting result but also a corresponding confidence map. Using this map as feedback, it progressively fills the hole by trusting only high-confidence pixels inside the hole at each iteration and focuses on the remaining pixels in the next iteration. As it reuses partial predictions from the previous iterations as known pixels, this process gradually improves the result. In addition, we propose a guided upsampling network to enable generation of high-resolution inpainting results. We achieve this by extending the Contextual Attention module to borrow high-resolution feature patches in the input image. Furthermore, to mimic real object removal scenarios, we collect a large object mask dataset and synthesize more realistic training data that better simulates user inputs. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. \"",

This paper proposes a deep video compression method to simultaneously encode multiple frames with Frame-Conv3D and differential modulation. We first adopt Frame-Conv3D instead of traditional Channel-Conv3D for efficient multi-frame fusion. When generating the binary representation, the multi-frame differential modulation is utilized to alleviate the effect of quantization noise. By analyzing the forward and backward computing flow of the modulator, we identify that this technique can make full use of past frames' information to remove the redundancy between multiple frames, and thus achieves better performance. A dropout scheme combined with the differential modulator is proposed to enable bit rate optimization within a single model. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the H.264 and H.265 codecs in the region of low bit rate. Compared with recent DL-based methods, our model also achieves competitive performance. \"",

Combining the accuracy and refinement capabilities of iterative gradient-based optimization techniques with the robustness of deep neural networks, we propose a gradient descent algorithm that leverages a neural network to predict the parameter update rule for each iteration. This per-parameter and state-aware update guides the optimizer towards a good solution in very few steps, converging in typically few steps. During training our approach only requires MoCap data of human poses, parametrized via SMPL. From this data the network learns a subspace of valid poses and shapes in which optimization is performed much more efficiently. The approach does not require any hard to acquire image-to-3D correspondences. At test time we only optimize the 2D joint re-projection error without the need for any further priors or regularization terms. We show empirically that this algorithm is fast (avg. 120ms convergence), robust to initialization and dataset, and achieves state-of-the-art results on public evaluation datasets including the challenging 3DPW in-the-wild benchmark (improvement over SMPLify ($45\\%$) and also approaches using image-to-3D correspondences). \"",

However, it is hard to give a universal definition of point-level semantics that everyone would agree on. We observe that people have a consensus on semantic correspondences between two areas from different objects, but are less certain about the exact semantic meaning of each area. Therefore, we argue that by providing human labeled correspondences between different objects from the same category instead of explicit semantic labels, one can recover rich semantic information of an object. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset named CorresPondenceNet. Based on this dataset, we are able to learn dense semantic embeddings with a novel geodesic consistency loss. Accordingly, several state-of-the-art networks are evaluated on this correspondence benchmark. We further show that CorresPondenceNet could not only boost fine-grained understanding of heterogeneous objects but also cross-object registration and partial object matching.\"",

Existing methods fit a probability distribution to the training samples on their embedding space and detect outliers according to this distribution. The embedding space is often obtained from a discriminative classifier. However, such discriminative representation focuses only on known classes, which may not be critical for distinguishing the unknown classes. We argue that the representation space should be jointly learned from the inlier classifier and the density estimator (served as an outlier detector). We propose the OpenHybrid framework, which is composed of an encoder to encode the input data into a joint embedding space, a classifier to classify samples to inlier classes, and a flow-based density estimator to detect whether a sample belongs to the unknown category. A typical problem of existing flow-based models is that they may assign a higher likelihood to outliers. However, we empirically observe that such an issue does not occur in our experiments when learning a joint representation for discriminative and generative components. Experiments on standard open set benchmarks also reveal that an end-to-end trained OpenHybrid model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and flow-based baselines.\"",

The proposed I2L-MeshNet predicts the per-lixel likelihood on 1D heatmaps for each mesh vertex coordinate instead of directly regressing the parameters. Our lixel-based 1D heatmap preserves the spatial relationship in the input image and models the prediction uncertainty. We show that the proposed I2L-MeshNet significantly outperforms previous methods while providing visually pleasant mesh estimation results.

We introduce an auxiliary task of Fill-in the Identity, that aims to predict persons' IDs consistently within a set of clips, when the video descriptions are given. Our proposed approach to this task leverages a Transformer architecture allowing for coherent joint prediction of multiple IDs. One of the key components is a gender-aware textual representation as well an additional gender prediction objective in the main model. This auxiliary task allows us to propose a two-stage approach to Identity-Aware Video Description. We first generate multi-sentence video descriptions, and then apply our Fill-in the Identity model to establish links between the predicted person entities. To be able to tackle both tasks, we augment the Large Scale Movie Description Challenge (LSMDC) benchmark with new annotations suited for our problem statement. Experiments show that our proposed Fill-in the Identity model is superior to several baselines and recent works, and allows us to generate descriptions with locally re-identified people.\"",

We design the cascaded clustering on feature maps to generate the pseudo-labels of human parts. Specifically, for the pixels of all images of a person, we first group them to foreground or background and then group the foreground pixels to human parts. The cluster assignments are subsequently used as pseudo-labels of human parts to supervise the part estimation and ISP iteratively learns the feature maps and groups them. Finally, local features of both human body parts and personal belongings are obtained according to the self-learned part estimation, and only features of visible parts are utilized for the retrieval. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets validate the superiority of ISP over lots of state-of-the-art methods.\"",

In this paper, we present a new low-light image classification solution using Quanta Image Sensors (QIS). QIS are a new type of image sensors that possess photon counting ability without compromising on pixel size and spatial resolution. Numerous studies over the past decade have demonstrated the feasibility of QIS for low-light imaging, but their usage for image classification has not been studied. This paper fills the gap by presenting a novel student-teacher learning scheme which allows us to classify the noisy QIS raw data. We show that with student-teacher learning, we are able to achieve image classification at a photon level of one photon per pixel or lower.

To facilitate image-based table recognition with deep learning, we develop and release the largest publicly available table recognition dataset PubTabNet, containing 568k table images with corresponding structured HTML representation. PubTabNet is automatically generated by matching the XML and PDF representations of the scientific articles in PubMed Central Open Access Subset (PMCOA). We also propose a novel attention-based encoder-dual-decoder (EDD) architecture that converts images of tables into HTML code. The model has a structure decoder which reconstructs the table structure and helps the cell decoder to recognize cell content. In addition, we propose a new Tree-Edit-Distance-based Similarity (TEDS) metric for table recognition, which more appropriately captures multi-hop cell misalignment and OCR errors than the pre-established metric. The experiments demonstrate that the EDD model can accurately recognize complex tables solely relying on the image representation, outperforming the state-of-the-art by 9.7% absolute TEDS score.\"",

Our method is experimentally simple--we use an eye-safe laser pointer as a light source, and off-the-shelf RGB or RGB-D cameras to estimate the geometry of relay surfaces and observe two-bounce light. We analyze the photometric and geometric challenges of this new imaging problem, and develop a robust method that produces high-quality 3D reconstructions in uncontrolled settings where relay surfaces may be non-planar.\"",

Most studies have been conducted on this topic under the single-label classi\ufb01cation setting along with an assumption of balanced label distribution. This work expands this research horizon towards multi-label classi\ufb01cation. In doing so, we identify unanticipated adversity innately existent in many multilabel datasets, the long-tailed distribution. We jointly address the two independently solved problems, Catastropic Forgetting and the long-tailed label distribution by \ufb01rst empirically showing a new challenge of destructive forgetting of the minority concepts on the tail. Then, we curate two benchmark datasets, COCOseq and NUS-WIDEseq, that allow the study of both intra- and inter-task imbalances. Lastly, we propose a new sampling strategy for replay-based approach named Partitioning Reservoir Sampling (PRS), which allows the model to maintain a balanced knowledge of both head and tail classes.

The experimental protocol we define allows to explore key practical questions. What is the influence of the similarity between base and test classes? Given a fixed annotation budget, what is the optimal trade-off between the number of images per class and the number of classes? Given a fixed dataset, can features be improved by splitting or combining different classes? Should simple or diverse classes be annotated? In a wide range of experiments, we provide clear answers to these questions on the miniImageNet, ImageNet and CUB-200 datasets. We also show how the base dataset design can improve performance in few-shot classification more drastically than replacing a simple baseline by an advanced state of the art algorithm.\"",

To improve model robustness, adversarial training, formulated as a minimax optimization problem, has been recognized as one of the most effective defense mechanisms. However, the non-convex and non-concave property poses a great challenge to the minimax training. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that the commonly used PGD attack may not be optimal for inner maximization, and improved inner optimizer can lead to a more robust model. Then we leverage a learning-to-learn (L2L) framework to train an optimizer with recurrent neural networks (RNN), providing update directions and steps adaptively for the inner problem. By co-training optimizer's parameters and model's weights, the proposed framework consistently improves over PGD-based adversarial training and TRADES. \"",

        "abstract": "Data augmentation has been widely adopted for object detection in 3D point clouds. However, all previous related efforts have focused on manually designing specific data augmentation methods for individual architectures. In this work, we present the first attempt to automate the design of data augmentation policies for 3D object detection. We introduce the Progressive Population Based Augmentation (PPBA) algorithm, which learns to optimize augmentation strategies by narrowing down the search space and adopting the best parameters discovered in previous iterations. On the KITTI 3D detection test set, PPBA improves the StarNet detector by substantial margins on the moderate difficulty category of cars, pedestrians, and cyclists, outperforming all current state-of-the-art single-stage detection models. Additional experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset indicate that PPBA continues to effectively improve the StarNet and PointPillars detectors on a 20x larger dataset compared to KITTI. The magnitude of the improvements may be comparable to advances in 3D perception architectures and the gains come without an incurred cost at inference time. In subsequent experiments, we find that PPBA may be up to 10x more data efficient than baseline 3D detection models without augmentation, highlighting that 3D detection models may achieve competitive accuracy with far fewer labeled examples.\"",

We conduct comprehensive experiments to understand the isolating behavior of each component (i.e., local/global compactness and the clustering assumption) and compare our proposed model with state-of-the-art adversarial training methods.

To handle complex or simple motion patterns globally, our frame-level scheme RaFC-frame automatically decides the optimal flow map resolution for each video frame. To cope different types of motion patterns locally, our block-level scheme called RaFC-block can also select the optimal resolution for each local block of motion features. In addition, the rate-distortion criterion is applied to both RaFC-frame and RaFC-block and select the optimal motion coding mode for effective flow coding. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets HEVC, VTL, UVG and MCL-JCV clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our overall RaFC framework after combing RaFC-frame and RaFC-block for video compression.\"",

        "abstract": "While deep face recognition has benefited significantly from large-scale labeled data, current research is focused on leveraging unlabeled data to further boost performance, reducing the cost of human annotation. Prior work has mostly been in controlled settings, where the labeled and unlabeled data sets have no overlapping identities by construction. This is not realistic in large-scale face recognition, where one must contend with such overlaps, the frequency of which increases with the volume of data. Ignoring identity overlap leads to significant labeling noise, as data from the same identity is split into multiple clusters. To address this, we propose a novel identity separation method based on extreme value theory. It is formulated as an out-of-distribution detection algorithm, and greatly reduces the problems caused by overlapping-identity label noise. Considering cluster assignments as pseudo-labels, we must also overcome the labeling noise from clustering errors. We propose a modulation of the cosine loss, where the modulation weights correspond to an estimate of clustering uncertainty. Extensive experiments on both controlled and real settings demonstrate our method's consistent improvements over supervised baselines, e.g., 11.6% improvement on IJB-A verification.\"",

To this end, previous variation-specific methods make full use of task-related prior to design special network losses, which are typically not general among different tasks and scenarios. In contrast, the existing generic methods focus on improving the feature discriminability to minimize the intra-class distance while maximizing the interclass distance, which perform well on easy samples but fail on hard samples. To improve the performance on those hard samples for general tasks, we propose a novel Distribution Distillation Loss to narrow the performance gap between easy and hard samples, which is a simple, effective and generic for various types of facial variations. Specifically, we first adopt state-of-the-art classifiers such as ArcFace to construct two similarity distributions: teacher distribution from easy samples and student distribution from hard samples. Then, we propose a novel distribution-driven loss to constrain the student distribution to approximate the teacher distribution, which thus leads to smaller overlap between the positive and negative pairs in the student distribution. We have conducted extensive experiments on both generic large-scale face benchmarks and benchmarks with diverse variations on race, resolution and pose. The quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of our method over strong baselines, e.g., Arcface and Cosface. \"",

One key limitation of existing approaches lies in their lack of structural information exploitation, which leads to inaccurate spatial layout, discontinuous surface, and ambiguous boundaries. In this paper, we tackle this problem in three aspects. First, to exploit the spatial relationship of visual features, we propose a structure-aware neural network with spatial attention blocks. These blocks guide the network attention to global structures or local details across different feature layers. Second, we introduce a global focal relative loss for uniform point pairs to enhance spatial constraint in the prediction, and explicitly increase the penalty on errors in depth-wise discontinuous regions, which helps preserve the sharpness of estimation results. Finally, based on analysis of failure cases for prior methods, we collect a new Hard Case (HC) Depth dataset of challenging scenes, such as special lighting conditions, dynamic objects, and tilted camera angles. The new dataset is leveraged by an informed learning curriculum that mixes training examples incrementally to handle diverse data distributions. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in terms of both prediction accuracy on NYUDv2 dataset and generalization performance on unseen datasets.\"",

Compared with traditional pedestrian detection, we find multispectral pedestrian detection suffers from modality imbalance problems which will hinder the optimization process of dual-modality network and depress the performance of detector. Inspired by this observation, we propose Modality Balance Network (MBNet) which facilitates the optimization process in a much more flexible and balanced manner. Firstly, we design a novel Differential Modality Aware Fusion (DMAF) module to make the two modalities complement each other.

On the one hand, we retrieve Web images by image-to-image search, which incurs less domain shift from the curated data than other search methods. The Web images are diverse, supplying a wide variety of object poses, appearances, their interactions with the context, etc. On the other hand, we propose a novel learning method motivated by two parallel lines of work that explore unlabeled data for image classification: self-training and self-supervised learning. They fail to improve object detectors in their vanilla forms due to the domain gap between the Web images and curated datasets. To tackle this challenge, we propose a selective net to rectify the supervision signals in Web images. It not only identifies positive bounding boxes but also creates a safe zone for mining hard negative boxes. We report state-of-the-art results on detecting backpacks and chairs from everyday scenes, along with other challenging object classes. \"",

Within an individual pyramid level, we improve the cost volume construction process by departing from a warping- to a sampling-based strategy, which avoids ghosting and hence enables us to better preserve fine flow details. We further amplify the positive effects through a level-specific, loss max-pooling strategy that adaptively shifts the focus of the learning process on under-performing predictions. Our second contribution revises the gradient flow across pyramid levels. The typical operations performed at each pyramid level can lead to noisy, or even contradicting gradients across levels. We show and discuss how properly blocking some of these gradient components leads to improved convergence and ultimately better performance. Finally, we introduce a distillation concept to counteract the issue of catastrophic forgetting and thus preserving knowledge over models sequentially trained on multiple datasets. Our findings are conceptually simple and easy to implement, yet result in compelling improvements on relevant error measures that we demonstrate via exhaustive ablations on datasets like Flying Chairs2, Flying Things, Sintel and KITTI. We establish new state-of-the-art results on the challenging Sintel and KITTI 2012 test datasets, and even show the portability of our findings to different optical flow and depth from stereo approaches.\"",

However, existing query-based black-box adversarial attacks often require excessive model queries to maintain a high attack success rate. Therefore, in order to improve query efficiency, we explore the distribution of adversarial examples around benign inputs with the help of image structure information characterized by a Neural Process, and propose a Neural Process based black-box adversarial attack (NP-Attack) in this paper.

To do so, we first warp the image feature by learning a flow field to make the object part more consistent.The resulting body feature and the residual edge feature are further optimized under decoupled supervision by explicitly sampling different parts (body or edge) pixels.We show that the proposed framework with various baselines or backbone networks leads to better object inner consistency and object boundaries.Extensive experiments on four major road scene semantic segmentation benchmarks including extit{Cityscapes}, extit{CamVid}, extit{KIITI} and extit{BDD} show that our proposed approach establishes new state of the art while retaining high efficiency in inference.

Specifically, we develop VLN-BERT, a visiolinguistic transformer-based model for scoring the compatibility between an instruction ('...stop at the brown sofa') and a trajectory of panoramic RGB images captured by the agent. We demonstrate that pretraining VLN-BERT on image-text pairs from the web before fine-tuning on embodied path-instruction data significantly improves performance on VLN -- outperforming prior state-of-the-art in the fully-observed setting by 4 absolute percentage points on success rate.

However, it is difficult to use these learned semantics for real image editing. A common practice of feeding a real image to a trained GAN generator is to invert it back to a latent code. However, existing inversion methods typically focus on reconstructing the target image by pixel values yet fail to land the inverted code in the semantic domain of the original latent space. As a result, the reconstructed image cannot well support semantic editing through varying the inverted code. To solve this problem, we propose an in-domain GAN inversion approach, which not only faithfully reconstructs the input image but also ensures the inverted code to be semantically meaningful for editing. We first learn a novel domain-guided encoder to project a given image to the native latent space of GANs. We then propose domain-regularized optimization by involving the encoder as a regularizer to fine-tune the code produced by the encoder and better recover the target image. Extensive experiments suggest that our inversion method achieves satisfying real image reconstruction and more importantly facilitates various image editing tasks, significantly outperforming start-of-the-arts.\"",

However, autoregressive models have several limitations such as exposure bias and their training objective does not guarantee visual fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose to use Reinforced Adversarial Learning (RAL) based on policy gradient optimization for autoregressive models. By applying RAL, we enable a similar process for training and testing to address the exposure bias issue. In addition, visual fidelity has been further optimized with adversarial loss inspired by their strong counterparts: GANs. Due to the slow sampling speed of autoregressive models, we propose to use partial generation for faster training. RAL also empowers the collaboration between different modules of the VQ-VAE framework. To our best knowledge, the proposed method is first to enable adversarial learning in autoregressive models for image generation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show improvements over the MLE trained models. The proposed method improves both negative log-likelihood (NLL) and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID), which indicates improvements in terms of visual quality and diversity. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on Celeba for 64x64 image resolution, showing promise for large scale image generation.\"",

While previous works addressed the task of robust prediction in the context of full-image classification, we consider it for dense semantic segmentation. We build upon an insight from image classification that output robustness can be improved by increasing the network-bias towards object shapes. We present a new training schema that increases this shape bias. Our basic idea is to alpha-blend a portion of the RGB training images with faked images, where each class-label is given a fixed, randomly chosen color that is not likely to appear in real imagery. This forces the network to rely more strongly on shape cues. We call this data augmentation technique \"\"Painting-by-Numbers''. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our training schema for DeepLabv3$+$ with various network backbones, MobileNet-V2, ResNets, and Xception, and evaluate it on the Cityscapes dataset. With respect to our 16 different types of image corruptions and 5 different network backbones, we are in 74% better than training with clean data. For cases where we are worse than a model trained without our training schema, it is mostly only marginally worse. However, for some image corruptions such as images with noise, we see a considerable performance gain of up to 25%.\"",

        "abstract": "We propose a method to train a model so it can learn new classification tasks while improving with each task solved. This amounts to combining meta-learning with incremental learning. Different tasks can have disjoint classes, so one cannot directly align different classifiers as done in model distillation. On the other hand, simply aligning features shared by all classes does not allow the base model sufficient flexibility to evolve to solve new tasks. We therefore indirectly align features relative to a minimal set of anchor classes. Such indirect discriminant alignment (IDA) adapts a new model to old classes without the need to re-process old data, while leaving maximum flexibility for the model to adapt to new tasks. This process enables incrementally improving the model by processing multiple learning episodes, each representing a different learning task, even with few training examples. Experiments on few-shot learning benchmarks show that this incremental approach performs favorably compared to training the model with the entire dataset at once. \"",

In this paper, we show that the resulting networks are sensitive not only to global adversarial attacks, where perturbations affect the entire input image, but also to indirect local attacks, where the perturbations are confined to a small image region that does not overlap with the area that the attacker aims to fool. To this end, we introduce an indirect attack strategy, namely adaptive local attacks, aiming to find the best image location to perturb, while preserving the labels at this location and producing a realistic-looking segmentation map. Furthermore, we propose attack detection techniques both at the global image level and to obtain a pixel-wise localization of the fooled regions. Our results are unsettling: Because they exploit a larger context, more accurate semantic segmentation networks are more sensitive to indirect local attacks. We believe that our comprehensive analysis will motivate the community to design architectures with contextual dependencies that do not trade off robustness for accuracy.\"",

Meaningful conditions on GANsprovide greater flexibility and control over the nature of the target domain synthetic data. Existing conditional GANs commonly encode target domain label information as hard-coded categorical vectors in the form of0s and 1s. The major drawbacks of such representations are inability to encode the high-order semantic information of target categories and their relative dependencies. We propose a novel end-to-end learning framework based on Graph Convolutional Networks to learn the attribute representations to condition the generator. The GAN losses, the discriminator and attribute classification loss, are fed back to the graph resulting in the synthetic images that are more natural and clearer with respect to the attributes generation. Moreover, prior-arts are mostly given priorities to condition on the generator side, not on the discriminator side of GANs.We apply the conditions on the discriminator side as well via multi-task learning. We enhanced four state-of-the-art cGANs architectures: Stargan, Stargan-JNT, AttGAN and STGAN. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on challenging face attributes manipulation data set,CelebA, LFWA, and RaFD, show that the cGANs enhanced by our meth-ods outperform by a large margin, compared to their counter-parts and other conditioning methods, in terms of both target attributes recognition rates and quality measures such as PSNR and SSIM.\"",

        "abstract": "Fitting 3D morphable models (3DMMs) on faces is a well-studied problem, motivated by various industrial and research applications. 3DMMs express a 3D facial shape as a linear sum of basis functions. The resulting shape, however, is a plausible face only when the basis coefficients take values within limited intervals. Methods based on unconstrained optimization address this issue with a weighted $ll_2$ penalty on coefficients; however, determining the weight of this penalty is difficult, and the existence of a unique weight that works universally is questionable. We propose a new formulation that does not require the tuning of any weight parameter. Specifically, we formulate 3DMM fitting as an inequality-constrained optimization problem, where the primary constraint is that basis coefficients should not exceed the interval that is learned when the 3DMM is constructed. We employ additional constraints to exploit sparse landmark detectors by enforcing the facial shape to be within the error bounds of a reliable detector. To enable operation ``in-the-wild'', we use a robust objective function, namely gradient correlation. Our approach performs comparably with deep learning (DL) methods on ``in-the-wild'' data, which have inexact ground truth, and better than DL methods on more controlled data with exact ground truth. Since our formulation does not require any learning, it enjoys a versatility that allows it to operate with multiple frames of arbitrary sizes. This study's results encourage further research on 3DMM fitting with inequality-constrained optimization methods, which remained unexplored compared to unconstrained methods.\"",

We show that ISM can be estimated with a two-camera stereo setup without explicitly recovering scene depths, by measuring differential changes in disparity over time. We develop an active, single-shot structured light-based approach for robustly measuring ISM in challenging scenarios with textureless objects and complex geometries. The proposed approach is computationally light-weight, and can detect intricate obstacles (e.g., thin wire fences) by processing high-resolution images at high-speeds with limited computational resources. ISM can be readily integrated with depth and range maps as a complementary scene representation, potentially enabling high-speed navigation and robotic manipulation in extreme environments, with minimal device complexity.\"",

Given the camera intrinsics, infrastucture-based calibration techniques are able to estimate the extrinsics using 3D maps pre-built via SLAM or Structure-from-Motion. In this paper, we propose to fully calibrate a multi-camera system from scratch using an infrastructure-based approach. Assuming that the distortion is mainly radial, we introduce a two-stage approach. We first estimate the camera-rig extrinsics up to a single unknown translation component per camera. Next, we solve for both the intrinsic parameters and the missing translation components. Extensive experiments on multiple indoor and outdoor scenes with multiple multi-camera systems show that our calibration method achieves high accuracy and robustness. In particular, our approach is more robust than the naive approach of first estimating intrinsic parameters and pose per camera before refining the extrinsic parameters of the system.

We at-tribute this robustness to two fundamental characteristics of SNNs and analyze their effects. First, we exhibit that input discretization introduced by the Poisson encoder improves adversarial robustness with reduced number of timesteps. Second, we quantify the amount of adversarial accuracy with increased leak rate in Leaky-Integrate-Fire (LIF) neurons. Our results suggest that SNNs trained with LIF neurons and smaller number of timesteps are more robust than the ones with IF (Integrate-Fire) neurons and larger number of timesteps.

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) attempts to solve such a problem. Recent works show that self-training is a powerful approach to UDA. However, existing methods have difficulty in balancing scalability and performance. In this paper, we propose an instance adaptive self-training framework for UDA on the task of semantic segmentation. To effectively improve the quality of pseudo-labels, we develop a novel pseudo-label generation strategy with an instance adaptive selector. Besides, we propose the region-guided regularization to smooth the pseudo-label region and sharpen the non-pseudo-label region. Our method is so concise and efficient that it is easy to be generalized to other unsupervised domain adaptation methods. Experiments on `GTA5 to Cityscapes' and `SYNTHIA to Cityscapes' demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods.\"",

        "abstract": "Although recent works have made significant progress in encoding meaningful context information for instance segmentation in 2D images, the works for 3D point cloud counterpart lag far behind. Conventional methods use radius search or other similar methods for aggregating local information. However, these methods are unaware of the instance context and fail to realize the boundary and geometric information of an instance, which are critical to separate adjacent objects. In this work, we study the influence of instance-aware knowledge by proposing an Instance-Aware Module (IAM). The proposed IAM learns discriminative instance embedding features in two-fold: (1) Instance contextual regions, covering the spatial extension of an instance, are implicitly learned and propagated in the decoding process. (2) Instance-dependent geometric knowledge is included in the embedding space, which is informative and critical to discriminate adjacent instances. Moreover, the proposed IAM is free from complex and time-consuming operations, showing superiority in both accuracy and efficiency over the previous methods. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, comprehensive experiments have been conducted on three popular benchmarks for instance segmentation: ScannetV2, S3DIS, and PartNet. The flexibility of our method allows it to handle both indoor scenes and CAD objects. We achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods substantially.\"",

        "abstract": "Weakly supervised localization aims at finding target object regions using only image-level supervision. However, localization maps extracted from classification networks are often not accurate due to the lack of fine pixel-level supervision. In this paper, we propose to leverage pixel-level similarities across different objects for learning more accurate object locations in a complementary way. Particularly, two kinds of constraints are proposed to prompt the consistency of object features within the same categories. The first constraint is to learn the stochastic feature consistency among discriminative pixels that are randomly sampled from different images within a batch. The discriminative information embedded in one image can be leveraged to benefit its counterpart with inter-image communication. The second constraint is to learn the global consistency of object features throughout the entire dataset. We learn a feature center for each category and realize the global feature consistency by forcing the object features to approach class-specific centers. The global centers are actively updated with the training process. The two constraints can benefit each other to learn consistent pixel-level features within the same categories, and finally improve the quality of localization maps. We conduct extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks, i.e., ILSVRC and CUB-200-2011. Our method achieves the Top-1 localization error rate of 45.17% on the ILSVRC validation set, surpassing the current state-of-the-art method by a large margin.

However, such information is hard to obtain, and thus very few datasets support it. In this paper, we propose an interactive framework for annotating 3D object geometry from both point cloud data and RGB imagery. The key idea behind our approach is to exploit strong priors that humans have about the 3D world in order to interactively annotate complete 3D shapes. Our framework targets a wide pool of annotators, i.e. naive users without artistic or graphics expertise. In particular, we introduce two simple-to-use interaction modules. First, we make an automatic guess of the 3D shape and allow the user to provide feedback about large errors by drawing scribbles in desired 2D views. Next, we aim to correct minor errors, in which users drag and drop 3D mesh vertices, assisted by a neural interactive module implemented as a Graph Convolutional Network. Experimentally, we show that only a few user interactions are needed to produce good quality 3D shapes on popular benchmarks such as ShapeNet, Pix3D, and ScanNet. We implement our framework as a web service and conduct a user study, where we show that user annotated data using our method effectively facilitates real-world learning tasks.

        "abstract": "Interactive image restoration aims to generate restored images by adjusting a controlling coefficient which determines the restoration level. Previous works are restricted in modulating image with a single coefficient. However, real images always contain multiple types of degradation, which cannot be well determined by one coefficient. To make a step forward, this paper presents a new problem setup, called multi-dimension (MD) modulation, which aims at modulating output effects across multiple degradation types and levels. Compared with the previous single-dimension (SD) modulation, the MD is setup to handle multiple degradations adaptively and relief unbalanced learning problem in different degradations. We also propose a deep architecture - CResMD with newly introduced controllable residual connections for multi-dimension modulation. Specifically, we add a controlling variable on the conventional residual connection to allow a weighted summation of input and residual. The values of these weights are generated by another condition network. We further propose a new data sampling strategy based on beta distribution to balance different degradation types and levels. With corrupted image and degradation information as inputs, the network can output the corresponding restored image. By tweaking the condition vector, users can control the output effects in MD space at test time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CResMD achieve excellent performance on both SD and MD modulation tasks.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a knowledge distillation method for foreground object search (FoS). Given a background and a rectangle specifying the foreground location and scale, FoS retrieves compatible foregrounds in a certain category for later image composition. Foregrounds within the same category can be grouped into a small number of patterns. Instances within each pattern are compatible with any query input interchangeably. These instances are referred to as interchangeable foregrounds. We first present a pipeline to build pattern-level FoS dataset containing labels of interchangeable foregrounds. We then establish a benchmark dataset for further training and testing following the pipeline. As for the proposed method, we first train a foreground encoder to learn representations of interchangeable foregrounds. We then train a query encoder to learn query-foreground compatibility following a knowledge distillation framework. It aims to transfer knowledge from interchangeable foregrounds to supervise representation learning of compatibility. The query feature representation is projected to the same latent space as interchangeable foregrounds, enabling very efficient and interpretable instance-level search. Furthermore, pattern-level search is feasible to retrieve more controllable, reasonable and diverse foregrounds. The proposed method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by $10.42\\%$ in absolute difference and $24.06\\%$ in relative improvement evaluated by mean average precision (mAP). Extensive experimental results also demonstrate its efficacy from various aspects. The benchmark dataset and code will be release shortly.\"",

By maximizing the mutual information between the vectors and input images, the module is trained to select specific filters to distill a unique calculation path for each input. Furthermore, to improve the interpretability and compactness of the decoupled network, the output of each layer is encoded to align the architecture encoding vector with the constraint of sparsity regularization. Unlike conventional pixel-level or filter-level network interpretation methods, we propose a path-level analysis to explore the relationship between the combination of filter and semantic concepts, which is more suitable to interpret the working rationale of the network.

However, without transfer learning, the learned model is fixed as is, which is not adaptable for handling various unseen scenarios. In this paper, beyond representation learning, we consider how to formulate person image matching directly in deep feature maps. We treat image matching as finding local correspondences in feature maps, and construct query-adaptive convolution kernels on the fly to achieve local matching. In this way, the matching process and results are interpretable, and this explicit matching is more generalizable than representation features to unseen scenarios, such as unknown misalignments, pose or viewpoint changes. To facilitate end-to-end training of this architecture, we further build a class memory module to cache feature maps of the most recent samples of each class, so as to compute image matching losses for metric learning. Through direct cross-dataset evaluation, the proposed Query-Adaptive Convolution (QAConv) method gains large improvements over popular learning methods (about 10%+ mAP), and achieves comparable results to many transfer learning methods. Besides, a model-free temporal cooccurrence based score weighting method called TLift is proposed, which improves the performance to a further extent, achieving state-of-the-art results in cross-dataset person re-identification.

One promising way to achieve a good trade-off between segmentation accuracy and efficiency is knowledge distillation. In this paper, different from previous methods performing knowledge distillation for densely pairwise relations, we propose a novel intra-class feature variation distillation (IFVD) to transfer the intra-class feature variation (IFV) of the cumbersome model (teacher) to the compact model (student). Concretely, we compute the feature center (regarded as the prototype) of each class and characterize the IFV with the set of similarity between the feature on each pixel and its corresponding class-wise prototype. The teacher model usually learns more robust intra-class feature representation than the student model, making them have different IFV. Transferring such IFV from teacher to student could make the student mimic the teacher better in terms of feature distribution, and thus improve the segmentation accuracy. We evaluate the proposed approach on three widely adopted benchmarks: Cityscapes, CamVid and Pascal VOC 2012, consistently improving state-of-the-art methods.\"",

        "abstract": "We present a learning-based method for interpolating and manipulating 3D shapes represented as point clouds, that is explicitly designed to preserve intrinsic shape properties. Our approach is based on constructing a dual encoding space that enables shape synthesis and, at the same time, provides links to the intrinsic shape metric, which is typically not available on point cloud data. Our method works in a single pass and avoids expensive optimization, employed by existing techniques. Furthermore, the strong regularization provided by our dual latent space approach also helps to improve shape recovery in challenging settings from noisy point clouds across datasets. Extensive experiments show that our method results in more realistic and smoother interpolations compared to baselines.\"",

        "abstract": "High-resolution digital images are usually downscaled to fit various display screens or save the cost of storage and bandwidth, meanwhile the post-upscaling is adpoted to recover the original resolutions or the details in the zoom-in images. However, typical image downscaling is a non-injective mapping due to the loss of high-frequency information, which leads to the ill-posed problem of the inverse upscaling procedure and poses great challenges for recovering details from the downscaled low-resolution images. Simply upscaling with image super-resolution methods results in unsatisfactory recovering performance. In this work, we propose to solve this problem by modeling the downscaling and upscaling processes from a new perspective, i.e. an invertible bijective transformation, which can largely mitigate the ill-posed nature of image upscaling. We develop an Invertible Rescaling Net (IRN) with deliberately designed framework and objectives to produce visually-pleasing low-resolution images and meanwhile capture the distribution of the lost information using a latent variable following a specified distribution in the downscaling process. In this way, upscaling is made tractable by inversely passing a randomly-drawn latent variable with the low-resolution image through the network. Experimental results demonstrate the significant improvement of our model over existing methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of image upscaling reconstruction from downscaled images.

We extract the latent space of real-world reflectance by conditioning this model, which directly results in a strong reflectance prior.

By integrating this novel BRDF model and reflectance and illumination priors in a MAP estimation formulation, we show that this joint estimation can be computed efficiently with stochastic gradient descent. We experimentally validate the accuracy of the invertible neural BRDF model on a large number of measured data and demonstrate its use in object inverse rendering on a number of synthetic and real images.

However, the underlying drawbacks of GANs and VAEs (e.g., the hardness of training with ZSL-oriented regularizers and the limited generation quality) hinder the existing generative ZSL models from fully bypassing the seen-unseen bias. To tackle the above limitations, for the first time, this work incorporates a new family of generative models (i.e., flow-based models) into ZSL. The proposed Invertible Zero-shot Flow (IZF) learns factorized data embeddings (i.e., the semantic factors and the non-semantic ones) with the forward pass of an invertible flow network, while the reverse pass generates data samples. This procedure theoretically extends conventional generative flows to a conditional scheme. To explicitly solve the bias problem, our model enlarges the seen-unseen distributional discrepancy based on negative sample-based distance measurement. Notably, IZF works flexibly with either a naive Bayesian classifier or a held-out trainable one for zero-shot recognition. Experiments on widely-adopted ZSL benchmarks demonstrate the significant performance gain of IZF over existing methods, in terms of both classic and generalized settings.\"",

        "abstract": "Easy availability of wearable egocentric cameras, and the sense of privacy propagated by the fact that the wearer is never seen in the captured videos, has led to a tremendous rise in public sharing of such videos. Unlike hand-held cameras, egocentric cameras are harnessed on the wearer\u2019s head, which makes it possible to track the wearer\u2019s head motion by observing optical flow in the egocentric videos. In this work, we create a novel kind of privacy attack by extracting the wearer\u2019s gait profile, a well known biometric signature, from such optical flow in the egocentric videos. We demonstrate strong wearer recognition capabilities based on extracted gait features, an unprecedented and critical weakness completely absent in hand-held videos. We demonstrate the following attack scenarios: (1) In a closed-set scenario, we show that it is possible to recognize the wearer of an egocentric video with an accuracy of more than 92.5% on the benchmark video dataset. (2) In an open-set setting, when the system has not seen the camera wearer even once during the training, we show that it is still possible to identify that the two egocentric videos have been captured by the same wearer with an Equal Error Rate (EER) of less than 14.35%. (3) We show that it is possible to extract gait signature even if only sparse optical flow and no other scene information from egocentric video is available. We demonstrate the accuracy of more than 84% for wearer recognition with only global optical flow. (4) While the first person to first person matching does not give us access to the wearer\u2019s face, we show that it is possible to match the extracted gait features against the one obtained from a third person view such as a surveillance camera looking at the wearer in a completely different background at a different time. In essence, our work indicates that sharing one\u2019s egocentric video should be treated as giving away one\u2019s biometric identity and recommend much more oversight before sharing of egocentric videos.

Furthermore, a two-stage learnable point elimination technique is presented to improve computational efficiency and reduce false positive correspondence pairs. A novel mutual-supervision loss is proposed to train the model without extra annotations of keypoints.

        "abstract": "State-of-the-art single depth image-based 3D hand pose estimation methods are based on dense predictions, including voxel-to-voxel predictions, point-to-point regression, and pixel-wise estimations. Despite the good performance, those methods have a few issues in nature, such as the poor trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, and plain feature representation learning with local convolutions. In this paper, a novel pixel-wise prediction-based method is proposed to address the above issues. The key ideas are two-fold: a) explicitly modeling the dependencies among joints and the relations between the pixels and the joints for better local feature representation learning; b) unifying the dense pixel-wise offset predictions and direct joint regression for end-to-end training. Specifically, we first propose a graph convolutional network (GCN) based joint graph reasoning module to model the complex dependencies among joints and augment the representation capability of each pixel. Then we densely estimate all pixels' offsets to joints in both image plane and depth space and calculate the joints' positions by a weighted average over all pixels' predictions, totally discarding the complex post-processing operations. The proposed model is implemented with an efficient 2D fully convolutional network (FCN) backbone and has only about 1.4M parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D hand pose estimation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy while running very efficiently with around a speed of 110fps on a single NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU.\"",

Thanks to the joint-based representation, our model enjoys some significant advantages over prior blendshape-based models. First, it is very compact such that we are orders of magnitude smaller while still keeping strong modeling capacity. Second, because each joint has its semantic meaning, interactive facial geometry editing is made easier and more intuitive. Third, through skinning, our model supports adding mouth interior and eyes, as well as accessories (hair, eye glasses, etc.) in a simpler, more accurate and principled way. We argue that because the human face is highly structured and topologically consistent, it does not need to be learned entirely from data. Instead we can leverage prior knowledge in the form of a human-designed 3D face rig to reduce the data dependency, and learn a compact yet strong face model from only a small dataset (less than one hundred 3D scans). To further improve the modeling capacity, we train a skinning weight generator through adversarial learning. Experiments on fitting high-quality 3D scans (both neutral and expressive), noisy depth images, and RGB images demonstrate that its modeling capacity is on-par with state-of-the-art face models, such as FLAME and Facewarehouse, even though the model is 10 to 20 times smaller. This suggests broad value in both graphics and vision applications on mobile and edge devices.\"",

        "abstract": "Segmentation, and Registration System for 3D Multi-Modal Image Alignment of Large-scale Pathological CT Scans\",\"Multi-modal image registration is a challenging problem that is also an important clinical task for many real applications and scenarios. As a first step in analysis, deformable registration among different image modalities is often required in order to provide complementary visual information. During registration, semantic information is key to match homologous points and pixels. Nevertheless, many conventional registration methods are incapable in capturing high-level semantic anatomical dense correspondences. In this work, we propose a novel multi-task learning system, JSSR, based on an end-to-end 3D convolutional neural network that is composed of a generator, a registration and a segmentation component. The system is optimized to satisfy the implicit constraints between different tasks in an unsupervised manner. It first synthesizes the source domain images into the target domain, then an intra-modal registration is applied on the synthesized images and target images. The segmentation module are then applied on the synthesized and target images, providing additional cues based on semantic correspondences. The supervision from another fully-annotated dataset is used to regularize the segmentation. We extensively evaluate JSSR on a large-scale medical image dataset containing 1,485 patient CT imaging studies of four different contrast phases (i.e., 5,940 3D CT scans with pathological livers) on the registration, segmentation and synthesis tasks. The performance is improved after joint training on the registration and segmentation tasks by 0.9% and 1.9% respectively compared to a highly competitive and accurate deep learning baseline. The registration also consistently outperforms conventional state-of-the-art multi-modal registration methods.\"",

        "abstract": "Snow removal usually affects the performance of computer vision. Comparing with other atmospheric phenomenon (e.g., haze and rain), snow is more complicated due to its transparency, various size, and accumulation of veiling effect, which make single image de-snowing more challenging. In this paper, first, we reformulate the snow model. Different from that in the previous works, in the proposed snow model, the veiling effect is included. Second, a novel joint size and transparency-aware snow removal algorithm called JSTASR is proposed. It can classify snow particles according to their sizes and conduct snow removal in different scales. Moreover, to remove the snow with different transparency, the transparency-aware snow removal is developed. It can address both transparent and non-transparent snow particles by applying the modified partial convolution. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves significant improvement on both synthetic and real-world datasets and is very helpful for object detection on snow images.\"",

We propose a new end-to-end model for photorealistic style transfer that is both fast and inherently generates photorealistic results. The core of our approach is a feed-forward neural network that learns local edge-aware affine transforms that automatically obey the photorealism constraint. When trained on a diverse set of images and a variety of styles, our model can robustly apply style transfer to an arbitrary pair of input images. Compared to the state of the art, our method produces visually superior results and is three orders of magnitude faster, enabling real-time performance at 4K on a mobile phone. We validate our method with ablation and user studies.\"",

Recently, there has been a growing interest in using unsupervised domain adaptation to address this scalability issue. Existing methods typically conduct adaptation on the representation space that contains both id-related and id-unrelated factors, thus inevitably undermining the adaptation efficacy of id-related features. In this paper, we seek to improve adaptation by purifying the representation space to be adapted. To this end, we propose a joint learning framework that disentangles id-related/unrelated features and enforces adaptation to work on the id-related feature space exclusively. Our model involves a disentangling module that encodes cross-domain images into a shared appearance space and two separate structure spaces, and an adaptation module that performs adversarial alignment and self-training on the shared appearance space. The two modules are co-designed to be mutually beneficial. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed joint learning framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by clear margins.\"",

It optimizes an objective function closely related to the Symmetric Multiway Cut objective and empirically shows efficient scaling behavior. Due to the algorithm's efficiency, it can operate directly on pixels without prior over-segmentation of the image into superpixels. We evaluate the performance on the Cityscapes dataset (2D urban scenes) and on a 3D microscopy volume. In urban scenes, the proposed algorithm combined with current deep neural networks outperforms the strong baseline of `Panoptic Feature Pyramid Networks' by Kirillov et al. (2019).

The local one-hot classification assigns images in a training batch with different person IDs, then adopts a Self-Adaptive Classification (SAC) model to classify them. The global multi-class classification is achieved by predicting labels on the entire unlabeled training set with the Memory-based Temporal-guided Cluster (MTC). MTC predicts multi-class labels by considering both visual similarity and temporal consistency to ensure the quality of label prediction. The two classification models are combined in a unified framework, which effectively leverages the unlabeled data for discriminative feature learning. Experimental results on three large-scale ReID datasets demonstrate the superiority of proposed method in both unsupervised and unsupervised domain adaptive ReID tasks. For example, under unsupervised setting, our method outperforms recent unsupervised domain adaptive methods, which leverage more labels for training.\"",

Event-based sensors deliver high temporal resolution motion information in a sparse, non-redundant format. This creates the potential for low computation, low latency motion recognition. Neural networks which extract global motion information, however, are generally computationally expensive. Here, we introduce a novel shallow and compact neural architecture and learning approach to capture reliable visual motion information along with the corresponding confidence of inference. Our network makes a prediction of the visual motion at each spatial location using only local events. Our confidence network then identifies which of these predictions will be accurate. In the task of recovering pan-tilt ego velocities from events, we show that each individual confident local prediction of our network can be expected to be as accurate as state of the art optimization approaches which utilize the full image. Furthermore, on a publicly available dataset, we find our local predictions generalize to scenes with camera motions and the presence of independently moving objects. This makes the output of our network well suited for motion based tasks, such as the segmentation of independently moving objects. We demonstrate on a publicly available motion segmentation dataset that restricting predictions to confident regions is sufficient to achieve results that exceed state of the art methods. \"",

The proposed KMN surpasses the state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks by a significant margin (+5% on DAVIS 2017 test-dev set).

In this paper, we propose a novel method combining local approaches with global context. We introduce a light weighted, unsupervised, key-frame proposal network (K-FPN) to select informative frames and a learned dictionary to recover the entire pose sequence from these frames. The K-FPN speeds up the pose estimation and provides robustness to bad frames with occlusion, motion blur, and illumination changes, while the learned dictionary provides global dynamic context.

Specifically, we first propose a novel decomposition of object orientation as well as a self-balancing 3D confidence. We show that both components are critical to enable our kinematic model to work effectively. Collectively, using only a single model, we efficiently leverage 3D kinematics from monocular videos to improve the overall localization precision in 3D object detection while also producing useful by-products of scene dynamics (ego-motion and per-object velocity). We achieve state-of-the-art performance on monocular 3D object detection and the Bird's Eye View tasks within the KITTI self-driving dataset. \"",

        "abstract": "Knowledge distillation, which involves extracting the \"\"dark knowledge\"\" from a teacher network to guide the learning of a student network, has emerged as an important technique for model compression and transfer learning. Unlike previous works that exploit architecture-specific cues such as activation and attention for distillation, here we wish to explore a more general and model-agnostic approach for extracting \"\"richer dark knowledge\"\" from the pre-trained teacher model. We show that the seemingly different self-supervision task can serve as a simple yet powerful solution. For example, when performing contrastive learning between transformed entities, the noisy predictions of the teacher network reflect its intrinsic composition of semantic and pose information. By exploiting the similarity between those self-supervision signals as an auxiliary task, one can effectively transfer the hidden information from the teacher to the student. In this paper, we discuss practical ways to exploit those noisy self-supervision signals with selective transfer for distillation. We further show that self-supervision signals improve conventional distillation with substantial gains under few-shot and noisy-label scenarios. Given the richer knowledge mined from self-supervision, our knowledge distillation approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, i.e., CIFAR100 and ImageNet, under both similar-architecture and cross-architecture settings. The advantage is even more pronounced under the cross-architecture setting, where our method outperforms the state of the art CRD by an average of 2.3% in accuracy rate on CIFAR100 across six different teacher-student pairs.\"",

Recently, Deep Mutual Learning (DML) presented a two-way KT strategy, showing that the student network can be also helpful to improve the teacher network. In this paper, we propose Dense Cross-layer Mutual-distillation (DCM), an improved two-way KT method in which the teacher and student networks are trained collaboratively from scratch. To augment knowledge representation learning, well-designed auxiliary classifiers are added to certain hidden layers of both teacher and student networks. To boost KT performance, we introduce dense bidirectional KD operations between the layers appended with classifiers. After training, all auxiliary classifiers are discarded, and thus there are no extra parameters introduced to final models. We test our method on a variety of KT tasks, showing its superiorities over related methods. Code is available at https://github.com/sundw2014/DCM\"",

In ROLL, each of these tasks is in charge of extracting rich and diverse information by 1) processing scene dialogues, 2) generating unsupervised video scene descriptions, and 3) obtaining external knowledge in a weakly supervised fashion. To answer a given question correctly, the information generated by each inspired-cognitive task is encoded via Transformers and fused through a modality weighting mechanism, which balances the information from the different sources. Exhaustive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, which yields a new state-of-the-art on two challenging video question answering datasets: KnowIT VQA and TVQA+.\"",

This paper presents an innovative label-free expression editing via disentanglement (LEED) framework that is capable of editing the expression of both frontal and profile facial images without requiring any expression labels. The idea is to disentangle the identity and expression of a facial image in the expression manifold, where the neutral face captures the identity attribute and the displacement between the neutral image and the expressive image captures the expression attribute. Two novel losses are designed for optimal expression disentanglement and consistent synthesis, including a mutual expression information loss that aims to extract pure expression-related features and a siamese loss that aims to enhance the expression similarity between the synthesized image and the reference image. Extensive experiments over two public facial expression datasets show that LEED achieves superior facial expression editing qualitatively and quantitatively.\"",

Key to our construction is the introduction of a geometric distortion criterion, defined directly on the decoded shapes, translating the preservation of the metric on the decoding to the formation of linear paths in the underlying latent space. Our rationale lies in the observation that training samples alone are often insufficient to endow generative models with high fidelity, motivating the need for large training datasets. In contrast, metric preservation provides a rigorous way to control the amount of geometric distortion incurring in the construction of the latent space, leading in turn to synthetic samples of higher quality. We further demonstrate, for the first time, the adoption of differentiable intrinsic distances in the backpropagation of a geodesic loss. Our geometric priors are particularly relevant in the presence of scarce training data, where learning any meaningful latent structure can be especially challenging. The effectiveness and potential of our generative model is showcased in applications of style transfer and content generation using triangle meshes and point clouds.\"",

When the input is degraded by a new distortion, inspired by adult neurogenesis in human memory system, we develop a neural growing strategy where the previously trained model can incorporate a new expert branch and continually accumulate new knowledge without interfering with learned knowledge.

The proposed LST can be efficiently implemented with existing CNN modules, such as point-wise and depth-wise separable convolutions, and it is portable to existing CNN architectures for seamless training and inference.We further present a hybrid soft thresholding and ReLU (ST-ReLU) activation scheme, making the trained network, namely LST-Net, more robust to image corruptions at the inference stage. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, ImageNet-C and Places365-Standard datasets validated that the proposed LST-Net can obtain even higher accuracy than its counterpart networks with fewer parameters and less overhead.\"",

Taking the algorithm of label propagation (LP) as an example, we analyze the challenges of adopting LP to UDA and theoretically analyze the conditions of affinity graph/matrix construction in order to achieve better propagation of true labels to unlabeled instances. Our analysis suggests a new algorithm of Label Propagation with Augmented Anchors (A$^2$LP), which could potentially improve LP via generation of unlabeled virtual instances (i.e., the augmented anchors) with high-confidence label predictions. To make the proposed A$^2$LP useful for UDA, we propose empirical schemes to generate such virtual instances. The proposed schemes also tackle the domain-shift challenge of UDA by alternating between pseudo labeling via A$^2$LP and domain-invariant feature learning. Experiments show that such a simple SSL extension improves over representative UDA methods of domain-invariant feature learning, and could empower two state-of-the-art methods on benchmark UDA datasets. Our results show the value of further investigation on SSL techniques for UDA problems.\"",

        "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation enables to alleviate the need for pixel-wise annotation in the semantic segmentation. One of the most common strategies is to translate images from the source domain to the target domain and then align their marginal distributions in the feature space using adversarial learning. However, source-to-target translation enlarges the bias in translated images and introduces extra computations, owing to the dominant data size of the source domain. Furthermore, consistency of the joint distribution in source and target domains cannot be guaranteed through global feature alignment. Here, we present an innovative framework, designed to mitigate the image translation bias and align cross-domain features with the same category. This is achieved by 1) performing the target-to-source translation and 2) reconstructing both source and target images from their predicted labels. Extensive experiments on adapting from synthetic to real urban scene understanding demonstrate that our framework competes favorably against existing state-of-the-art methods.\"",

        "abstract": "Curriculum learning can improve neural network training by guiding the optimization to desirable optima. We propose a novel curriculum learning approach for image classification that adapts the loss function by changing the label representation. The idea is to use a probability distribution over classes as target label, where the class probabilities reflect the similarity to the true class. Gradually, this label representation is shifted towards the standard one-hot-encoding. That is, in the beginning minor mistakes are corrected less than large mistakes, resembling a teaching process in which broad concepts are explained first before subtle differences are taught. The class similarity can be based on prior knowledge. For the special case of the labels being natural words, we propose a generic way to automatically compute the similarities. The natural words are embedded into Euclidean space using a standard word embedding. The probability of each class is then a function of the cosine similarity between the vector representations of the class and the true label. The proposed label-similarity curriculum learning (LCL) approach was empirically evaluated using several popular deep learning architectures for image classification tasks applied to five datasets including ImageNet, CIFAR100, and AWA2. In all scenarios, LCL was able to improve the classification accuracy on the test data compared to standard training.

First, we optimize the label encoding function via an AutoEncoder defined in the label space, approximating the \"\"desired\"\" intermediate representations for the target object detector. Second, taking advantage of the learned label encoding function, we introduce a new auxiliary loss attached to the detection backbones, thus benefiting the performance of the derived detector.

During training, they generate semantically consistent features, but discard this constraint during feature synthesis and classification. We propose to enforce semantic consistency at all stages of (generalized) zero-shot learning: training, feature synthesis and classification. We first introduce a feedback loop, from a semantic embedding decoder, that iteratively refines the generated features during both the training and feature synthesis stages. The synthesized features together with their corresponding latent embeddings from the decoder are then transformed into discriminative features and utilized during classification to reduce ambiguities among categories. Experiments on (generalized) zero-shot object and action classification reveal the benefit of semantic consistency and iterative feedback, outperforming existing methods on six zero-shot learning benchmarks.

This paper shows that the sample and feature exaction, which are two important procedures for removing noisy and redundant information encoded in training samples in both sample and feature perspectives, can be effectively and efficiently performed in the latent topic space by considering topic-based feature-label correlation.

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks with a massive number of layers have made a remarkable breakthrough on single image super-resolution (SR), but sacrifice computation complexity and memory storage. To address this problem, we focus on the lightweight models for fast and accurate image SR. Due to the frequent use of residual block (RB) in SR models, we pursue an economical structure to adaptively combine RBs. Drawing lessons from lattice filter bank, we design the lattice block (LB) in which two butterfly structures are applied to combine two RBs. LB has the potential of various linear combinations of two RBs. Each case of LB depends on the combination coefficients which are determined by the attention mechanism. LB favors the lightweight SR model with the reduction of about half amount of the parameters while keeping the similar SR performance. Moreover, we propose a lightweight SR model, LatticeNet, which uses series connection of LBs and the backward feature fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal can achieve superior accuracy on four available benchmark datasets against other state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining relatively low computation and memory requirements.\"",

This has been well explored theoretically for linear models. We extend this analysis to deep neural networks (DNNs) in order to investigate their learning dynamics. To this end, we propose layer-wise conditioning analysis, which explores the optimization landscape with respect to each layer independently. Such an analysis is theoretically supported under mild assumptions that approximately hold in practice. Based on our analysis, we show that batch normalization (BN) can stabilize the training, but sometimes result in the false impression of a local minimum, which has detrimental effects on the learning. Besides, we experimentally observe that BN can improve the layer-wise conditioning of the optimization problem. Finally, we find that the last linear layer of a very deep residual network displays ill-conditioned behavior. We solve this problem by only adding one BN layer before the last linear layer, which achieves improved performance over the original and pre-activation residual networks.\"",

In this paper, we treat the graphs as graphs on a super-graph, and propose a novel breadth first search based method for expanding the neighborhood on the super-graph for a new coming graph, such that the matching with the new graph can be efficiently performed within the constructed neighborhood. Then depth first search is performed to update the overall pairwise matchings.

Given a crowd's immediate state, current approaches must be successively repeated over multiple time-steps for long-term predictions, leading to compute expensive and error-prone results. However, most applications require the ability to accurately predict hundreds of possible simulation outcomes (e.g., under different environment and crowd situations) at real-time rates, for which these approaches are prohibitively expensive. We propose the first deep framework to instantly predict the long-term flow of crowds in arbitrarily large, realistic environments. Central to our approach are a novel representation CAGE, which efficiently encodes crowd scenarios into compact, fixed-size representations that losslessly represent the environment, and a modified SegNet architecture for instant long-term crowd flow prediction. We conduct comprehensive experiments on novel synthetic and real datasets. Our results indicate that our approach is able to capture the essence of real crowd movement over very long time periods, while generalizing to never-before-seen environments and crowd contexts.\"",

Yet, how to propagate labels reliably, especially on a dataset with unknown outliers, remains an open question. Conventional methods such as linear diffusion lack the capability of handling complex graph structures and may perform poorly when the seeds are sparse. Latest methods based on graph neural networks would face difficulties on performance drop as they scale out to noisy graphs. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a new framework that allows labels to be propagated reliably on large-scale real-world data. This framework incorporates (1) a local graph neural network to predict accurately on varying local structures while maintaining high scalability, and (2) a confidence-based path scheduler that identifies outliers and moves forward the propagation frontier in a prudent way. Experiments on both ImageNet and Ms-Celeb-1M show that our confidence guided framework can significantly improve the overall accuracies of the propagated labels, especially when the graph is very noisy.\"",

For all-day video surveillance, commercial camera systems usually adopt auxiliary NIR cut filter and NIR LED illumination to selectively block or enhance NIR signal according to the surrounding light conditions. This switching between the daytime and the nighttime mode inevitably involves mechanical parts, and thus requires frequent maintenance. Furthermore, images captured at nighttime mode are in shortage of chrominance, which might hinder human interpretation and high-level computer vision algorithms in succession. In this paper, we present a deep learning based approach that directly generates human-friendly, visible color for video surveillance in a day. To enable training, we capture well-aligned video pairs through a customized optical device and contribute a large-scale dataset, video surveillance in a day (VSIAD). We propose a novel multi-task deep network with state synchronization modules to better utilize texture and chrominance information. Our trained model generates high-quality visible color images and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics as well as subjective judgment.\"",

However, the standard inner product in the commonly-used cost volume may limit the representation capacity of flow models because it neglects the correlation among different channel dimensions and weighs each dimension equally. To address this issue, we propose a learnable cost volume (LCV) using an elliptical inner product, which generalizes the standard inner product by a positive definite kernel matrix. To guarantee its positive definiteness, we perform spectral decomposition on the kernel matrix and re-parameterize it via the Cayley representation. The proposed LCV is a lightweight module and can be easily plugged into existing models to replace the vanilla cost volume. Experimental results show that the LCV module not only improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art models on standard benchmarks, but also promotes their robustness against illumination change, noises, and adversarial perturbations of the input signals.\"",

The annotation is particularly difficult for temporal action localization where large parts of the video present no action, or background. To address these challenges, we here propose a self-supervised and generic method to isolate actions from their background. We build on the observation that actions often follow a particular temporal order and, hence, can be predicted by other actions in the same video. As consecutive actions might be separated by minutes, differently to prior work on the arrow of time, we here exploit long-range temporal relations in 10-20 minutes long videos. To this end, we propose a new model that learns actionness via a self-supervised proxy task of order verification. The model assigns high actionness scores to clips which order is easy to predict from other clips in the video. To obtain a powerful and action-agnostic model, we train it on the large-scale unlabeled HowTo100M dataset with highly diverse actions from instructional videos. We validate our method on the task of action localization and demonstrate consistent improvements when combined with other recent weakly-supervised methods.\"",

Different from existing multi-view based methods, HEAR develops a unified framework to address both multi-view redundancy and single-view incompleteness. Specifically, HEAR firstly employs a hybrid attention (HA) module, which consists of a view-agnostic attention (VAA) block and a view-specific attention (VSA) block. These two blocks jointly explore distinct but complementary spatial saliency of local features for each single-view image. Subsequently, a multi-granular view pooling (MVP) module is introduced to aggregate the multi-view features with different granularities in a coarse-to-fine manner. The resulting feature set implicitly has hierarchical relations, which are therefore projected into a Hyperbolic space by adopting the Hyperbolic embedding. A hierarchical representation is learned by Hyperbolic multi-class logistic regression based on the Hyperbolic geometry. Experimental results clearly show that HEAR outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on three 3D shape recognition tasks including generic 3D shape retrieval, 3D shape classification and sketch-based 3D shape retrieval. \"",

        "abstract": "Modeling imaging sensor noise is a fundamental problem for image processing and computer vision applications. While most previous works adopt statistical noise models, real-world noise is far more complicated and beyond what these models can describe. To tackle this issue, we propose a data-driven approach, where a generative noise model is learned from real-world noise. The proposed noise model is camera-aware, that is, different noise characteristics of different camera sensors can be learned simultaneously, and a single learned noise model can generate different noise for different camera sensors. Experimental results show that our method quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms existing statistical noise models and learning-based methods.

Previous approaches showed that scenes with few entities can be controlled using scene graphs, but this approach struggles as the complexity of the graph (the number of objects and edges) increases. In this work, we show that one limitation of current methods is their inability to capture semantic equivalence in graphs. We present a novel model that addresses these issues by learning canonical graph representations from the data, resulting in improved image generation for complex visual scenes. Our model demonstrates improved empirical performance on large scene graphs, robustness to noise in the input scene graph, and generalization on semantically equivalent graphs.

        "abstract": "Seeking effective neural networks is a critical and practical field in deep learning. Besides designing the depth, type of convolution, normalization, and nonlinearities, the topological connectivity of neural networks is also important. Previous principles of rule-based modular design simplify the difficulty of building an effective architecture, but constrain the possible topologies in limited spaces. In this paper, we attempt to optimize the connectivity in neural networks. We propose a topological perspective to represent a network into a complete graph for analysis, where nodes carry out aggregation and transformation of features, and edges determine the flow of information. By assigning learnable parameters to the edges which reflect the magnitude of connections, the learning process can be performed in a differentiable manner. We further attach auxiliary sparsity constraint to the distribution of connectedness, which promotes the learned topology focus on critical connections. This learning process is compatible with existing networks and owns adaptability to larger search spaces and different tasks. Quantitative results of experiments reflect the learned connectivity is superior to traditional rule-based ones, such as random, residual and complete. In addition, it obtains significant improvements in image classification and object detection without introducing excessive computation burden.\"",

Changing the model architecture, however, comes at the cost of adding more complexity to inference, making models slower. Data augmentation, on the other hand, doesn't add any inference complexity, but is insufficiently studied in object detection for two reasons. First it is more difficult to design plausible augmentation strategies for object detection than for classification, because one must handle the complexity of bounding boxes if geometric transformations are applied. Secondly, data augmentation attracts less research attention perhaps because it is believed to add less value and to transfer poorly compared to advances in network architectures.",

The D-features are then used to establish correspondence with all features of input image under conditional random field (CRF) formulation, which is leveraged to boost consistency between pixels.

To further demonstrate the generalizability of our framework, DFNet is also applied to the image object co-segmentation task.

To decompose such interference, we introduce the concept of Disentangled Feature Learning to achieve the feature-level divide-and-conquer of hybrid distortions. Specifically, we propose the feature disentanglement module (FDM) to distribute feature representations of different distortions into different channels by revising gain-control-based normalization. We also propose a feature aggregation module (FAM) with channel-wise attention to adaptively filter out the distortion representations and aggregate useful content information from different channels for the construction of raw image. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by visualizing the correlation matrix of features and channel responses of different distortions.

To address this issue, we propose a model based on mutual information estimation without relying on image reconstruction or image generation. Mutual information maximization is performed to capture the attributes of data in the shared and exclusive representations while we minimize the mutual information between the shared and exclusive representation to enforce representation disentanglement.

Given a bunch of variations in a single unit of the latent representation, it is expected that there is a change in a single factor of variation of the data while others are fixed. However, this impressive experimental observation is rarely explicitly encoded in the objective function of learning disentangled representations. This paper defines the variation predictability of latent disentangled representations. Given image pairs generated by latent codes varying in a single dimension, this varied dimension could be closely correlated with these image pairs if the representation is well disentangled. Within an adversarial generation process, we encourage variation predictability by maximizing the mutual information between latent variations and corresponding image pairs. We further develop an evaluation metric that does not rely on the ground-truth generative factors to measure the disentanglement of latent representations. The proposed variation predictability is a general constraint that is applicable to the VAE and GAN frameworks for boosting disentanglement of latent representations. Experiments show that the proposed variation predictability correlates well with existing ground-truth-required metrics and the proposed algorithm is effective for disentanglement learning.\"",

        "abstract": "With the goal of recovering high-quality image content from its degraded version, image restoration enjoys numerous applications, such as in surveillance, computational photography and medical imaging. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved dramatic improvements over conventional approaches for image restoration task. Existing CNN-based methods typically operate either on full-resolution or on progressively low-resolution representations. In the former case, spatially precise but contextually less robust results are achieved, while in the latter case, semantically reliable but spatially less accurate outputs are generated. In this paper, we present an architecture with the collective goals of maintaining spatially-precise high-resolution representations through the entire network and receiving strong contextual information from the low-resolution representations. The core of our approach is a multi-scale residual block containing several key elements: (a) parallel multi-resolution convolution streams for extracting multi-scale features, (b) information exchange across the multi-resolution streams, (c) spatial and channel attention mechanisms for capturing contextual information, and (d) attention based multi-scale feature aggregation. In a nutshell, our approach learns an enriched set of features that combines contextual information from multiple scales, while simultaneously preserving the high-resolution spatial details.

To do so, we devise both a new loss function that exploits the epipolar constraint given by camera poses, and a new model architecture that makes the whole pipeline differentiable and efficient. Because we no longer need pixel-level ground-truth correspondences, our framework opens up the possibility of training on much larger and more diverse datasets for better and unbiased descriptors. We call the resulting descriptors CAmera Pose Supervised, or CAPS, descriptors.

Extensive experiments on six public benchmarks, OTB2015, NFS, GOT10k, TrackingNet, VOT2018, and VOT2019, show that our approach is efficient and generalizes well to class-agnostic target objects in online tracking, thus achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while running beyond the real-time speed.

We propose a novel Flow-based Feature Warping Model (FFWM) which can learn to synthesize photo-realistic and illumination preserving frontal images with illumination inconsistent supervision. Specifically, an Illumination Preserving Module (IPM) is proposed to learn illumination preserving image synthesis from illumination inconsistent image pairs. IPM includes two pathways which collaborate to ensure the synthesized frontal images are illumination preserving and with fine details. Moreover, a Warp Attention Module (WAM) is introduced to reduce the pose discrepancy in the feature level, and hence to synthesize frontal images more effectively and preserve more details of profile images. The attention mechanism in WAM helps reduce the artifacts caused by the displacements between the profile and the frontal images. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that our FFWM can synthesize photo-realistic and illumination preserving frontal images and performs favorably against state-of-the-art results.\"",

We refer to these models as `Experts\u2019, and the proposed LFME framework aggregates the knowledge from multiple `Experts' to learn a unified student model. Specifically, the proposed framework involves two levels of adaptive learning schedules: Self-paced Expert Selection and Curriculum Instance Selection, so that the knowledge is adaptively transferred to the `Student'. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate that our method is able to achieve superior performances compared to state-of-the-art methods.

We generate point clouds by performing stochastic gradient ascent on an unnormalized probability density, thereby moving sampled points toward the high-likelihood regions. Our model directly predicts the gradient of the log density field and can be trained with a simple objective adapted from score-based generative models.

We model modality interaction in both the sequence and channel levels in a pairwise fashion, and the pairwise interaction also provides some explainability for the predictions of target tasks.

The inference typically requires Markov chain Monte Caro (MCMC) that can be time consuming. In this paper, we propose to use noise initialized non-persistent short run MCMC, such as finite step Langevin dynamics initialized from the prior distribution of the latent variables, as an approximate inference engine, where the step size of the Langevin dynamics is variationally optimized by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution produced by the short run MCMC and the posterior distribution.

The proposed model consists of two sub-models parameterized by neural networks: (1) a saliency predictor that maps input images to clean saliency maps, and (2) a noise generator, which is a latent variable model that produces noises from Gaussian latent vectors. The whole model that represents noisy labels is a sum of the two sub-models. The goal of training the model is to estimate the parameters of both sub-models, and simultaneously infer the corresponding latent vector of each noisy label. We propose to train the model by using an alternating back-propagation (ABP) algorithm, which alternates the following two steps: (1) learning back-propagation for estimating the parameters of two sub-models by gradient ascent, and (2) inferential back-propagation for inferring the latent vectors of training noisy examples by Langevin Dynamics. To prevent the network from converging to trivial solutions, we utilize an edge-aware smoothness loss to regularize hidden saliency maps to have similar structures as their corresponding images. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed model. \"",

        "abstract": "Video object segmentation, i.e., the separation of a target object from background in video, has made significant progress on real and challenging videos in recent years. To leverage this progress in 3D applications, this paper addresses the problem of learning to estimate the depth of segmented objects given some measurement of camera motion (e.g., from robot kinematics or vehicle odometry). We achieve this by, first, introducing a diverse, extensible dataset and, second, designing a novel deep network that estimates the depth of objects using only segmentation masks and uncalibrated camera movement. Our data-generation framework creates artificial object segmentations that are scaled for changes in distance between the camera and object, and our network learns to estimate object depth even with segmentation errors. We demonstrate our approach across domains using a robot camera to locate objects from the YCB dataset and a vehicle camera to locate obstacles while driving.\"",

In this task, it is critical to learn informative visual representation and robust navigation policy. Aiming to improve these two components, this paper proposes three complementary techniques, object relation graph (ORG), trial-driven imitation learning (IL), and a memory-augmented tentative policy network (TPN). ORG improves visual representation learning by integrating object relationships, including category closeness and spatial correlations, mph{e.g.,} a TV usually co-occurs with a remote spatially. Both Trial-driven IL and TPN underlie robust navigation policy, instructing the agent to escape from deadlock states, such as looping or being stuck. Specifically, trial-driven IL is a type of supervision used in policy network training, while TPN, mimicking the IL supervision in unseen environment, is applied in testing. %instructing an agent to escape from deadlock states. Experiment in the artificial environment AI2-Thor validates that each of the techniques is effective. When combined, the techniques bring significantly improvement over baseline methods in navigation effectiveness and efficiency in unseen environments.

In this process, one of the key challenges is to reduce the risk of generalizing the inherent characteristics of numerous unknown samples learned from a small amount of known data. In this paper, we propose a new concept, Reciprocal Point, which is the potential representation of the extra-class space corresponding to each known category. The sample can be classified to known or unknown by the otherness with reciprocal points. To tackle the open set problem, we offer a novel open space risk regularization term. Based on the bounded space constructed by reciprocal points, the risk of unknown is reduced through multi-category interaction. The novel learning framework called Reciprocal Point Learning (RPL), which can indirectly introduce the unknown information into the learner with only known classes, so as to learn more compact and discriminative representations. Moreover, we further construct a new large-scale challenging aircraft dataset for open set recognition: Aircraft 300 (Air-300). Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets indicate that our framework is significantly superior to other existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard open set benchmarks.\"",

We evaluated the learning ability of MEM on various toy datasets, point cloud classification, and classification of whole slide images (WSIs) into two subtypes of the lung cancer--Lung Adenocarcinoma, and Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma. We systematically extracted patches from WSIs of the lung, downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, the largest public repository of WSIs, achieving a competitive accuracy of 84.84% for classification of two sub-types of lung cancer. The results on other datasets are promising as well, and demonstrate the efficacy of our model. \\keywords{Permutation Invariant Models, Multi Instance Learning, Whole Slide Image Classification, Medical Images}\"",

        "abstract": "Learning predictive models from interaction with the world allows an agent, such as a robot, to learn about how the world works, and then use this learned model to plan coordinated sequences of actions to bring about desired outcomes. However, learning a model that captures the dynamics of complex skills represents a major challenge: if the agent needs a good model to perform these skills, it might never be able to collect the experience on its own that is required to learn these delicate and complex behaviors. Instead, we can imagine augmenting the training set with observational data of other agents, such as humans. Such data is likely more plentiful, but cannot always be combined with data from the original agent. For example, videos of humans might show a robot how to use a tool, but (i) are not annotated with suitable robot actions, and (ii) contain a systematic distributional shift due to the embodiment differences between humans and robots. We address the first challenge by formulating the corresponding graphical model and treating the action as an observed variable for the interaction data and an unobserved variable for the observation data, and the second challenge by using a domain-dependent prior. In addition to interaction data, our method is able to leverage videos of passive observations in a driving dataset and a dataset of robotic manipulation videos to improve video prediction performance. We also demonstrate that, in a real-world tabletop robotic manipulation setting, we are able to significantly improve control performance by learning a model from both robot data and observations of humans.\"",

Specifically, we feed the network with the sequential joints encoded with the temporal information for spatial and temporal explorations. Second, to further exploit the inherent kinematic chains for better 3D structures, we apply a progressive-decoding strategy, which performs in a central-to-peripheral extension according to the structural connectivity. Last, in order to incorporate a general motion space for high-quality prediction, we build a memory-based dictionary, which aims to preserve the global motion patterns in training data to guide the predictions.

In this paper, we propose a dedicated method to generate attribution maps that allow us to learn the propagation rules automatically, overcoming the flaws of the hand-crafted ones. Specifically, we introduce a learnable plugin module, which enables adaptive propagation rules for each pixel, to the non-linear layers during the backward pass for mask generating. The masked input image is then fed into the model again to obtain new output that can be used as a guidance when combined with the original one. The introduced learnable module can be trained under any auto-grad framework with higher-order differential support.

Like all supervised approaches, these networks require ground truth data during training. However, collecting large quantities of accurate dense correspondence data is very challenging. We propose that it is unnecessary to have such a high reliance on ground truth depths or even corresponding stereo pairs. Inspired by recent progress in monocular depth estimation, we generate plausible disparity maps from single images. In turn, we use those flawed disparity maps in a carefully designed pipeline to generate stereo training pairs. Training in this manner makes it possible to convert any collection of single RGB images into stereo training data. This results in a significant reduction in human effort, with no need to collect real depths or to hand-design synthetic data. We can consequently train a stereo matching network from scratch on datasets like COCO, which were previously hard to exploit for stereo. Through extensive experiments we show that our approach outperforms stereo networks trained with standard synthetic datasets, when evaluated on KITTI, ETH3D, and Middlebury.\"",

We promote an accurate learning of motion without human annotation by training a neural network to discriminate a video sequence from its temporally transformed versions. To learn to distinguish non-trivial motions, the design of the transformations is based on two principles: 1) To de\ufb01ne clusters of motions based on time warps of di\ufb00erent magnitude; 2) To ensure that the discrimination is feasible only by observing and analyzing as many image frames as possible.

Starting from the observation that captioned images are easily crawlable, we argue that this overlooked source of information can be exploited to supervise the training of visual representations. To do so, motivated by the recent progresses in language models, we introduce {m image-conditioned masked language modeling} (ICMLM) -- a proxy task to learn visual representations over image-caption pairs. ICMLM consists in predicting masked words in captions by relying on visual cues. To tackle this task, we propose hybrid models, with dedicated visual and textual encoders, and we show that the visual representations learned as a by-product of solving this task transfer well to a variety of target tasks. Our experiments confirm that image captions can be leveraged to inject global and localized semantic information into visual representations. Project website: https://europe.naverlabs.com/ICMLM.\"",

We demonstrate that pairs of minimally-different examples with different labels, a.k.a counterfactual examples, provide a signal indicative of the underlying causal structure of the task. We show that such pairs can be identified in a number of existing datasets for a range of tasks in vision (visual question answering, multi-label image classification) and natural language processing (sentiment analysis, natural language inference).

Due to the complex structure, point sets are distributed off-balance and diversely, appearing as both category and pattern imbalance. It has been proved that deep networks can easily forget the non-dominant cases during training, which influences the model generalization and leads to unsatisfactory performance. Although re-weighting on instances may reduce the influence, it is hard to find a balance between the dominant and the non-dominant cases. To tackle the above issue, we propose a memory-augmented network that learns and memorizes the representative prototypes that encode both geometry and semantic information. The prototypes are shared by diverse 3D points and recorded in a universal memory module. During training, the memory slots are dynamically associated with both dominant and non-dominant cases, alleviating the forgetting issue. In testing, the distorted observations and rare cases can thus be augmented by retrieving the stored prototypes, leading to better generalization. Experiments on the benchmarks, i.e., S3DIS and ScanNetV2, show the superiority of our method on both effectiveness and efficiency, which substantially improves the accuracy not only on the entire dataset but also on non-dominant classes and samples.\"",

Our algorithm is based on a reasonable assumption that, in general, regardless of the size of the object and stuff (given context) the semantic labeling should be unchanged. We show that this constraint is violated over the images of the target domain, and hence could be used to transfer labels in-between differently scaled patches. Specifically, we show that semantic segmentation model produces output with high entropy when presented with scaled-up patches of target domain, in comparison to when presented original size images. These scale-invariant examples are extracted from the most confident images of the target domain. Dynamic class specific entropy thresholding mechanism is presented to filter out unreliable pseudo-labels. Furthermore, we also incorporate the focal loss to tackle the problem of class imbalance in self-supervised learning. Extensive experiments have been performed, and results indicate that exploiting the scale-invariant labeling, we outperform existing self-supervised based state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods. Specifically, we achieve 1.3% and 3.8% of lead for GTA5 to Cityscapes and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes with VGG16-FCN8 baseline network.\"",

Recently, generative replay mechanisms (GRM), have been proposed to reproduce previously learned knowledge aiming to reduce the forgetting. However, such approaches lack an appropriate inference model and therefore can not provide latent representations of data. In this paper, we propose a novel lifelong learning approach, namely the Lifelong VAEGAN (L-VAEGAN), which not only induces a powerful generative replay network but also learns meaningful latent representations, benefiting representation learning. L-VAEGAN can allow to automatically embed the information associated with different domains into several clusters in the latent space, while also capturing semantically meaningful shared latent variables, across different data domains. The proposed model supports many downstream tasks that traditional generative replay methods can not, including interpolation and inference across different data domains.\"",

As such, many prior approaches focus on learning representations which persist across all source domains with the assumption that these domain agnostic representations will generalize well. However, often individual domains contain characteristics which are unique and when leveraged can significantly aid in-domain recognition performance. To produce a model which best generalizes to both seen and unseen domains, we propose learning domain specific masks. The masks are encouraged to learn a balance of domain-invariant and domain-specific features, thus enabling a model which can benefit from the predictive power of specialized features while retaining the universal applicability of domain-invariant features.

Inspired by recent works on deep clustering, our approach leverages information from data gathered from multiple source domains to build a domain-agnostic clustering model which is then refined at inference time when target data become available. Specifically, at training time we propose to optimize a novel information-theoretic loss which, coupled with domain-alignment layers, ensures that our model learns to correctly discover semantic labels while discarding domain-specific features. Importantly, our architecture design ensures that at inference time the resulting source model can be effectively adapted to the target domain without having access to source data, thanks to feature alignment and self-supervision. We evaluate the proposed approach in a variety of settings, considering several domain adaptation benchmarks and we show that our method is able to automatically discover relevant semantic information even in presence of few target samples and yields state-of-the-art results on multiple domain adaptation benchmarks.\"",

In the nutshell, a knowledge graph is constructed on the prototypes of various domains to realize the information propagation among semantically adjacent representations. On such basis, a graph model is learned to predict query samples under the guidance of correlated prototypes.

In this work, we introduce a novel approach to visual correspondence that dynamically composes effective features by leveraging relevant layers conditioned on the images to match. Inspired by both multi-layer feature composition in object detection and adaptive inference architectures in classification, the proposed method, dubbed Dynamic Hyperpixel Flow, learns to compose hypercolumn features on the fly by selecting a small number of relevant layers from a deep convolutional neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness on the task of semantic correspondence, i.e., establishing correspondences between images depicting different instances of the same object or scene category.

In UDA, both the source and target label sets may hold individual labels not shared by the other domain. A mph{de facto} challenge of UDA is to classify the target examples in the shared classes against the domain shift. Another more prominent challenge of UDA is to mark the target examples in the target-individual label set (open classes) as ``unknown''. These two entangled challenges make UDA a highly under-explored problem. Previous work on UDA focuses on the classification of data in the shared classes and uses per-class accuracy as the evaluation metric, which is badly biased to the accuracy of shared classes. However, accurately detecting open classes is the mission-critical task to enable real universal domain adaptation. It further turns UDA problem into a well-established close-set domain adaptation problem. Towards accurate open class detection, we propose Calibrated Multiple Uncertainties (CMU) with a novel transferability measure estimated by a mixture of uncertainty quantities in complementation: entropy, confidence and consistency, defined on conditional probabilities calibrated by a multi-classifier ensemble model. The new transferability measure accurately quantifies the inclination of a target example to the open classes. We also propose a novel evaluation metric called H-score, which emphasizes the importance of both accuracies of the shared classes and the ``unknown'' class. Empirical results under the UDA setting show that CMU outperforms the state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods on all the evaluation metrics, especially by a large margin on the H-score.\"",

The self-supervised training uses only synchronously-recorded intensity frames and novel sensor data to maximize feature similarity between the pretrained network and the grafted network. We show that the enhanced grafted network reaches competitive average precision (AP50) scores to the pretrained network on an object detection task using thermal and event camera datasets, with no increase in inference costs. Particularly, the grafted network driven by thermal frames showed a relative improvement of 49.11% over the use of intensity frames. The grafted front end has only 5--8% of the total parameters and can be trained in a few hours on a single GPU equivalent to 5% of the time that would be needed to train the entire object detector from labeled data. NGA allows new vision sensors to capitalize on previously pretrained powerful deep models, saving on training cost and widening a range of applications for novel sensors.\"",

In this paper, we extrapolate those advances to the 3D domain, by studying 3D image-to-video translation with a particular focus on 4D facial expressions. Although 3D facial generative models have been widely explored during the past years, 4D animation remains relatively unexplored. To this end, in this study we employ a deep mesh encoder-decoder like architecture to synthesize realistic high resolution facial expressions by using a single neutral frame along with an expression identification. In addition, processing 3D meshes remains a non-trivial task compared to data that live on grid-like structures, such as images. Given the recent progress in mesh processing with graph convolutions, we make use of a recently introduced learnable operator which acts directly on the mesh structure by taking advantage of local vertex orderings. In order to generalize to 4D facial expressions across subjects, we trained our model using a high resolution dataset with 4D scans of six facial expressions from 180 subjects. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach preserves the subject's identity information even for unseen subjects and generates high quality expressions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study tackling the problem of 4D facial expression synthesis.\"",

The most common way of relating image regions with words in caption models is through an attention mechanism over the regions that are used as input to predict the next word. The model must therefore learn to predict the attentional weights without knowing the word it should localize. This is difficult to train without grounding supervision since recurrent models can propagate past information and there is no explicit signal to force the captioning model to properly ground the individual decoded words. In this work, we help the model to achieve this via a novel cyclical training regimen that forces the model to localize each word in the image after the sentence decoder generates it, and then reconstruct the sentence from the localized image region(s) to match the ground-truth. Our proposed framework only requires learning one extra fully-connected layer (the localizer), a layer that can be removed at test time. We show that our model significantly improves grounding accuracy without relying on grounding supervision or introducing extra computation during inference, for both image and video captioning tasks.

A main challenge for DG is that the available source domains often exhibit limited diversity, hampering the model's ability to learn to generalize. We therefore employ a data generator to synthesize data from pseudo-novel domains to augment the source domains. This explicitly increases the diversity of available training domains and leads to a more generalizable model. To train the generator, we model the distribution divergence between source and synthesized pseudo-novel domains using optimal transport, and maximize the divergence. To ensure that semantics are preserved in the synthesized data, we further impose cycle-consistency and classification losses on the generator. Our method, L2A-OT (Learning to Augment by Optimal Transport) outperforms current state-of-the-art DG methods on four benchmark datasets.\"",

Nevertheless, most practical methods still require all training videos to be labeled with temporal annotations (action category and temporal boundary) and develop the models in a fully-supervised manner, despite expensive labeling efforts and inapplicable to new categories. In this paper, we introduce a new design of transfer learning type to learn action localization for a large set of action categories, but only on action moments from the categories of interest and temporal annotations of untrimmed videos from a small set of action classes. Specifically, we present Action Herald Networks (AherNet) that integrate such design into an one-stage action localization framework. Technically, a weight transfer function is uniquely devised to build the transformation between classification of action moments or foreground video segments and action localization in synthetic contextual moments or untrimmed videos. The context of each moment is learnt through the adversarial mechanism to differentiate the generated features from those of background in untrimmed videos. Extensive experiments are conducted on the learning both across the splits of ActivityNet v1.3 and from THUMOS14 to ActivityNet v1.3. Our AherNet demonstrates the superiority even comparing to most fully-supervised action localization methods. More remarkably, we train AherNet to localize actions from 600 categories on the leverage of action moments in Kinetics-600 and temporal annotations from 200 classes in ActivityNet v1.3.\"",

Hence, it is necessary to predict saliency on multiple-face videos, which can provide attention cues for many content based applications. However, most of multiple-face prediction works only consider visual information and ignore audio, which is not consistent with the naturalistic scenarios. Several behavioral studies have established that sound influences human attention, especially during the speech turn-taking in multiple-face videos. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate such influences by establishing a large-scale eye-tracking database of Multiple-face Video in Visual-Audio condition (MVVA). Inspired by the findings of our investigation, we propose a novel multi-modal video saliency model consisting of three branches: visual, audio and face. The visual branch takes the RGB frames as the input and encodes them into visual feature maps. The audio and face branches encode the audio signal and multiple cropped faces, respectively. A fusion module is introduced to integrate the information from three modalities, and to generate the final saliency map. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms 11 state-of-the-art saliency prediction works. It performs closer to human multi-modal attention. \"",

Recently, the development of Event Cameras raises promising directions in solving this task thanks to its High Dynamic Range (HDR) and low requirement of computational sources. However, such cameras record sparse, asynchronous intensity changes of the scene (called events), instead of canonical images. In this paper, we propose learning to see in the dark by translating the HDR events in low light to canonical sharp images as if captured in day light. Since it is extremely challenging to collect paired event-image training data, a novel unsupervised domain adaptation network is proposed which explicitly separates domain-invariant features (e.g. scene structures) from the domain-specific ones (e.g. detailed textures) to ease representation learning. A detail enhancing branch is proposed to reconstruct day light-specific features from the domain-invariant representations in a residual manner, regularized by a ranking loss. To evaluate the proposed approach, a novel large-scale dataset is captured with a DAVIS240C camera with both day/low light events and intensity images. Experiments on this dataset show that the proposed domain adaptation approach achieves superior performance than various state-of-the-art architectures.\"",

        "abstract": "While visual object detection with deep learning has received much attention in the past decade, cases when heavy intra-class occlusions occur have not been studied thoroughly. In this work, we propose a novel Non-Maximum-Suppression (NMS) algorithm that dramatically improves the detection recall while maintaining high precision in scenes with heavy occlusions. Our NMS algorithm is derived from a novel embedding mechanism, in which the semantic and geometric features of the detected boxes are jointly exploited. The embedding makes it possible to determine whether two heavily-overlapping boxes belong to the same object in the physical world. Our approach is particularly useful for car detection and pedestrian detection in urban scenes where occlusions often happen. We show the effectiveness of our approach by creating a model called SG-Det (short for Semantics and Geometry Detection) and testing SG-Det on two widely-adopted datasets, KITTI and CityPersons for which it achieves state-of-the-art performance.\"",

Yet, object classes in large-scale datasets are sometimes ambiguous, which easily causes confusion. In addition, limited experience and knowledge of annotators can also lead to mislabeled object classes. To solve this issue, a novel method is proposed in this paper, which uses different losses describing different roles of noisy class labels to enhance the learning. Specifically, in instance segmentation, noisy class labels play different roles in the foreground-background sub-task and the foreground-instance sub-task. Hence, on the one hand, the noise-robust loss (e.g., symmetric loss) is used to prevent incorrect gradient guidance for the foreground-instance sub-task. On the other hand, standard cross entropy loss is used to fully exploit correct gradient guidance for the foreground-background sub-task. Extensive experiments conducted with three popular datasets (i.e., Pascal VOC, Cityscapes and COCO) have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method in a wide range of noisy class labels scenarios.\"",

Most SR methods based on CNNs have focused on achieving performance gains in terms of quality metrics, such as PSNR and SSIM, over classical approaches. They typically require a large amount of memory and computational units. FSRCNN, consisting of few numbers of convolutional layers, has shown promising results, while using an extremely small number of network parameters. We introduce in this paper a novel distillation framework, consisting of teacher and student networks, that allows to boost the performance of FSRCNN drastically. To this end, we propose to use ground-truth high-resolution (HR) images as privileged information. The encoder in the teacher learns the degradation process, subsampling of HR images, using an imitation loss. The student and the decoder in the teacher, having the same network architecture as FSRCNN, try to reconstruct HR images. Intermediate features in the decoder, affordable for the student to learn, are transferred to the student through feature distillation. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and the generalization ability of our framework, which significantly boosts the performance of FSRCNN as well as other SR methods.\"",

Moreover, due to their autoregressive nature, the computational complexity of existing models increases linearly as the length of the generated captions grows. Thus, we further devise a non-autoregressive image captioning approach that can generate captions in a length-irrelevant complexity. We verify the merit of the proposed length level embedding on three models: two state-of-the-art (SOTA) autoregressive models with different types of decoder, as well as our proposed non-autoregressive model, to show its generalization ability. In the experiments, our length-controllable image captioning models not only achieve SOTA performance on the challenging MS COCO dataset but also generate length-controllable and diverse image captions. Specifically, our non-autoregressive model outperforms the autoregressive baselines in terms of controllability and diversity, and also significantly improves the decoding efficiency for long captions.

Currently, many state of the art models are based on the Mask R-CNN framework which, while very powerful, outputs masks at low resolutions which could result in imprecise boundaries. On the other hand, classic variational methods for segmentation impose desirable global and local data and geometry constraints on the masks by optimizing an energy functional. While mathematically elegant, their direct dependence on good initialization, non-robust image cues and manual setting of hyperparameters renders them unsuitable for modern applications. We propose LevelSet R-CNN, which combines the best of both worlds by obtaining powerful feature representations that are combined in an end-to-end manner with a variational segmentation framework.

Each pixel in such images is characterized by a spectral signature, associated to a specific direction in space and obtained by processing the audio signals coming from an array of microphones. By coupling such array with a video camera, we obtain spatio-temporal alignment of acoustic images and video frames. This constitutes a powerful source of self-supervision, which can be exploited in the learning pipeline we are proposing, without resorting to expensive data annotations. However, since 2D planar arrays are cumbersome and not as widespread as ordinary microphones, we propose that the richer information content of acoustic images can be distilled, through a self-supervised learning scheme, into more powerful audio and visual feature representations. The learnt feature representations can then be employed for downstream tasks such as classification and cross-modal retrieval, without the need of a microphone array. To prove that, we introduce a novel multimodal dataset consisting in RGB videos, raw audio signals and acoustic images, aligned in space and synchronized in time. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of our hypothesis and the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline, also when tested for tasks and datasets different from those used for training.\"",

We propose a new end-to-end architecture that directly extracts a bird's-eye-view representation of a scene given image data from an arbitrary number of cameras. The core idea behind our approach is to ``lift'' each image individually into a frustum of features for each camera, then ``splat'' all frustums into a rasterized bird's-eye-view grid. By training on the entire camera rig, we provide evidence that our model is able to learn not only how to represent images but how to fuse predictions from all cameras into a single cohesive representation of the scene while being robust to calibration error. On standard bird's-eye-view tasks such as object segmentation and map segmentation, our model outperforms all baselines and prior work. In pursuit of the goal of learning dense representations for motion planning, we show that the representations inferred by our model enable interpretable end-to-end motion planning by ``shooting'' template trajectories into a bird's-eye-view cost map output by our network. We benchmark our approach against models that use oracle depth from lidar. Project page with code: https://nv-tlabs.github.io/lift-splat-shoot.\"",

To tackle this problem, we propose a \u201cgather-propagate-distribute\u201d scheme to model multimodal context by crossmodal interaction and implement this scheme as a novel Linguistic Structure guided Context Modeling (LSCM) module. Our LSCM module builds a Dependency Parsing Tree suppressed Word Graph (DPT-WG) which guides all the words to include valid multimodal context of the sentence while excluding disturbing ones through three steps over the multimodal feature, i.e., gathering, constrained propagation and distributing. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms all the previous state-of-the-arts.\"",

        "abstract": "Deep learning approaches have achieved great success in addressing the problem of optical flow estimation. The keys to success lie in the use of cost volume and coarse-to-fine flow inference. However, the matching problem becomes ill-posed when partially occluded or homogeneous regions exist in images. This causes a cost volume to contain outliers and affects the flow decoding from it. Besides, the coarse-to-fine flow inference demands an accurate flow initialization. Ambiguous correspondence yields erroneous flow fields and affects the flow inferences in subsequent levels. In this paper, we introduce LiteFlowNet3, a deep network consisting of two specialized modules, to address the above challenges. (1) We ameliorate the issue of outliers in the cost volume by amending each cost vector through an adaptive modulation prior to the flow decoding. (2) We further improve the flow accuracy by exploring local flow consistency. To this end, each inaccurate optical flow is replaced with an accurate one from a nearby position through a novel warping of the flow field. LiteFlowNet3 not only achieves promising results on public benchmarks but also has a small model size and a fast runtime.\"",

In this paper, we propose the local correlation exploration framework for knowledge distillation. It models three kinds of local knowledge, including intra-instance local relationship, inter-instance relationship on the same local position, and the inter-instance relationship across different local positions. Moreover, to make the student focus on those informative local regions of the teacher's feature maps, we propose a novel class-aware attention module to highlight the class-relevant regions and remove the confusing class-irrelevant regions, which makes the local correlation knowledge more accurate and valuable.

To address this task, we introduce a new 3D convolutional network architecture able to align representations from the support videos with the relevant query video segments. The network contains: (i) a mutual enhancement module to simultaneously complement the representation of the few trimmed support videos and the untrimmed query video; (ii) a progressive alignment module that iteratively fuses the support videos into the query branch; and (iii) a pairwise matching module to weigh the importance of different support videos. Evaluation of few-shot common action localization in untrimmed videos containing a single or multiple action instances demonstrates the effectiveness and general applicability of our proposal.\"",

In this work, we propose a novel three-stage framework that exploits scene context to tackle this task. Given a single scene image and 2D pose histories, our method first samples multiple human motion goals, then plans 3D human paths towards each goal, and finally predicts 3D human pose sequences following each path.

Motivated by professional workflows, we introduce an automatic method to make an image region more attention-capturing via subtle image edits that maintain realism and fidelity to the original. From an input image and a user-provided mask, our GazeShiftNet model predicts a distinct set of global parametric transformations to be applied to the foreground and background image regions separately. We present the results of quantitative and qualitative experiments that demonstrate improvements over prior state-of-the-art. In contrast to existing attention shifting algorithms, our global parametric approach better preserves image semantics and avoids typical generative artifacts. Our edits enable inference at interactive rates on any image size, and easily generalize to videos. Extensions of our model allow for multi-style edits and the ability to both increase and attenuate attention in an image region. Furthermore, users can customize the edited images by dialing the edits up or down via interpolations in parameter space. This paper presents a practical tool that can simplify future image editing pipelines.\"",

However,it is challenging to collect the required paired short-long exposure frames to learn a supervised mapping. Current approaches require a specialised rig or the use of static videos with no subject or object motion [5],resulting in datasets that are limited in size, diversity, and motion. We address the data collection bottleneck for low-light video RAW-to-RGB by proposing a data synthesis mechanism, dubbed SIDGAN, that can generate abundant dynamic video training pairs. SIDGAN maps videos found \u2018in the wild\u2019 (e.g. internet videos) into a low-light (short, long exposure) domain. By generating dynamic video data synthetically, we enable a recently proposed state-of-the-art RAW-to-RGB model to attain higher image quality (improved colour, reduced artifacts) and improved temporal consistency, compared to the same model trained with only static real video data\"",

MABNet is based on a novel Multibranch Adjustable Bottleneck (MAB) module, which is less demanding on parameters and computation. In a MAB module, feature map is split into various parallel branches, where the depthwise separable convolutions with different dilation rates extract features with multiple receptive fields however at an affordable computational budget. Besides, the number of channels in each branch is adjustable independently to tradeoff computation and accuracy. On SceneFlow and KITTI datasets, our MABNet achieves competitive accuracy with fewer parameters of 1.65M. Especially, MABNet_tiny reduces the parameters to 47K by cutting down the channels and layers in MABNet.\"",

While manually averting localizing highlight segments, weakly supervised modeling is challenging, as a video in our daily life could contain highlight segments with multiple event types, e.g., skiing and surfing. In this work, we propose casting weakly supervised video highlight detection modeling for a given specific event as a multiple instance ranking network (MINI-Net) learning. We consider each video as a bag of segments, and therefore, the proposed MINI-Net learns to enforce a higher highlight score for a positive bag that contains highlight segments of a specific event than those for negative bags that are irrelevant. In particular, we form a max-max ranking loss to acquire a reliable relative comparison between the most likely positive segment instance and the hardest negative segment instance. With this max-max ranking loss, our MINI-Net effectively leverages all segment information to acquire a more distinct video feature representation for localizing the highlight segments of a specific event in a video. The extensive experimental results on three challenging public benchmarks clearly validate the efficacy of our multiple instance ranking approach for solving the problem.\"",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we argue about the importance of considering task interactions at multiple scales when distilling task information in a multi-task learning setup. In contrast to common belief, we show that tasks with high affinity at a certain scale are not guaranteed to retain this behaviour at other scales, and vice versa. We propose a novel architecture, namely MTI-Net, that builds upon this finding in three ways. First, it explicitly models task interactions at every scale via a multi-scale multi-modal distillation unit. Second, it propagates distilled task information from lower to higher scales via a feature propagation module. Third, it aggregates the refined task features from all scales via a feature aggregation unit to produce the final per-task predictions.",

        "abstract": "Local features such as SIFT and its affine and learned variants provide region-to-region rather than point-to-point correspondences. It has recently been exploited to create new minimal solvers for classical problems such as homography, essential and fundamental matrix estimation. The main argument in favor of such solvers is that their minimal sample size is smaller, e.g., only two instead of four matches are required to estimate a homography. Works proposing such solvers often claim a significant improvement in run-time thanks to fewer RANSAC iterations. We show that this argument is not valid in practice if the solvers are used naively as noise in the local feature geometries often causes RANSAC to fail to find an accurate solution. To overcome this, we propose guidelines for effective use of region-to-region matches in the course of a full model estimation pipeline. We propose a method for refining the local feature geometries by symmetric intensity-based matching, combine uncertainty propagation inside RANSAC with preemptive model verification, show a general scheme for computing uncertainty of minimal solvers results, and adapt the sample cheirality check for homography estimation to region-to-region correspondences. Our experiments show that affine solvers can achieve accuracy comparable to point-based solvers at faster run-times when following our guidelines. \"",

These task-specific representations and, particularly, the invariances they capture turn neural networks into black box models that lack interpretability. To open such a black box, it is, therefore, crucial to uncover the different semantic concepts a model has learned as well as those that it has learned to be invariant to. We present an approach based on INNs that (i) recovers the task-specific, learned invariances by disentangling the remaining factor of variation in the data and that (ii) invertibly transforms these recovered invariances combined with the model representation into an equally expressive one with accessible semantic concepts. As a consequence, neural network representations become understandable by providing the means to (i) expose their semantic meaning, (ii) semantically modify a representation, and (iii) visualize individual learned semantic concepts and invariances. Our invertible approach significantly extends the abilities to understand black box models by enabling post-hoc interpretations of state-of-the-art networks without compromising their performance.\"",

In this paper, we propose a novel operator called malleable 2.5D convolution to learn the receptive field along the depth-axis. A malleable 2.5D convolution has one or more 2D convolution kernels. Our method assigns each pixel to one of the kernels or none of them according to their relative depth differences, and the assigning process is formulated as a differentiable form so that it can be learnt by gradient descent. The proposed operator runs on standard 2D feature maps and can be seamlessly incorporated into pre-trained CNNs. We conduct extensive experiments on two challenging RGB-D semantic segmentation dataset NYUDv2 and Cityscapes to validate the effectiveness and the generalization ability of our method.\"",

A recent study has shown that in addition to regular off-manifold adversarial images, there are also adversarial images on the manifold. In this paper, we propose adversarial variational autoencoder (A-VAE), a novel framework to tackle both types of attacks. We hypothesize that both off-manifold and on-manifold attacks move the image away from the high probability region of image manifold. We utilize variational autoencoder (VAE) to estimate the lower bound of the log-likelihood of image and explore to project the input images back into the high probability regions of image manifold again. At inference time, our model synthesizes multiple similar realizations of a given image by random sampling, then the nearest neighbor of the given image is selected as the final input of the face recognition model. We also use adversarial training to enhance the robustness of our model against adversarial perturbations. As a preprocessing operation, our method is attack-agnostic and can adapt to a wide range of resolutions. The experimental results on LFW demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art defense success rate against conventional off-manifold attacks such as FGSM, PGD, and C\\&W under both grey-box and white-box settings, and even on-manifold attack.\"",

        "abstract": "Recent end-to-end trainable methods for scene text spotting, integrating detection and recognition, showed much progress. However, most of the current arbitrary-shape scene text spotters use region proposal networks (RPN) to produce proposals. RPN relies heavily on manually designed anchors and its proposals are represented with axis-aligned rectangles. The former presents difficulties in handling text instances of extreme aspect ratios or irregular shapes, and the latter often includes multiple neighboring instances into a single proposal, in cases of densely oriented text. To tackle these problems, we propose Mask TextSpotter v3, an end-to-end trainable scene text spotter that adopts a Segmentation Proposal Network (SPN) instead of an RPN. Our SPN is anchor-free and gives accurate representations of arbitrary-shape proposals. It is therefore superior to RPN in detecting text instances of extreme aspect ratios or irregular shapes. Furthermore, the accurate proposals produced by SPN allow masked RoI features to be used for decoupling neighboring text instances. As a result, our Mask TextSpotter v3 can handle text instances of extreme aspect ratios or irregular shapes, and its recognition accuracy won't be affected by nearby text or background noise. Specifically, we outperform state-of-the-art methods by 21.9 percent on the Rotated ICDAR 2013 dataset (rotation robustness), 5.9 percent on the Total-Text dataset (shape robustness), and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MSRA-TD500 dataset (aspect ratio robustness).

        "abstract": "Feature distillation is an effective way to improve the performance for a smaller student model, which has fewer parameters and lower computation cost compared to the larger teacher model. Unfortunately, there is a common obstacle $-$ the gap in semantic feature structure between the intermediate features of teacher and student. The classic scheme prefers to transform intermediate features by adding the adaptation module, such as naive convolutional, attention-based or more complicated one. However, this introduces two problems: a) The adaptation module brings more parameters into training. b) The adaptation module with random initialization or special transformation isn't friendly for distilling a pre-trained student. In this paper, we present Matching Guided Distillation (MGD) as an efficient and parameter-free manner to solve these problems. The key idea of MGD is to pose matching the teacher channels with students' as an assignment problem. We compare three solutions of the assignment problem to reduce channels from teacher features with partial distillation loss. The overall training takes a coordinate-descent approach between two optimization objects $-$ assignments update and parameters update. Since MGD only contains normalization or pooling operations with negligible computation cost, it is flexible to plug into network with other distillation methods.

Stereo 360 imagery can be captured from multi-camera systems for virtual reality (VR) rendering, but lacks motion parallax and correct-in-all-directions disparity cues. Together, these can quickly lead to VR sickness when viewing content. One solution is to try and generate a format suitable for 6DoF rendering, such as by estimating depth. However, this raises questions as to how to handle disoccluded regions in dynamic scenes. Our approach is to simultaneously learn depth and blending weights via a multi-sphere image representation, which can be rendered with correct 6DoF disparity and motion parallax in VR. This significantly improves comfort for the viewer, and can be inferred and rendered in real time on modern GPU hardware. Together, these move towards making VR video a more comfortable immersive medium.\"",

        "abstract": "Articulations, Shapes and Objects for 3D Hand Pose Estimation under Hand-Object Interaction\",\"We study how well different types of approaches generalise in the task of 3D hand pose estimation under single hand scenarios and hand-object interaction. We show that the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods can drop, and that they fail mostly on poses absent from the training set. Unfortunately, since the space of hand poses is highly dimensional, it is inherently not feasible to cover the whole space densely, despite recent efforts in collecting large-scale training datasets. This sampling problem is even more severe when hands are interacting with objects and/or inputs are RGB rather than depth images, as RGB images also vary with lighting conditions and colors. To address these issues, we designed a public challenge (HANDS'19) to evaluate the abilities of current 3D hand pose estimators~(HPEs) to interpolate and extrapolate the poses of a training set. More exactly, HANDS'19 is designed (a) to evaluate the influence of both depth and color modalities on 3D hand pose estimation, under the presence or absence of objects; (b) to assess the generalisation abilities w.r.t. four main axes: shapes, articulations, viewpoints, and objects; (c) to explore the use of a synthetic hand models to fill the gaps of current datasets. Through the challenge, the overall accuracy has dramatically improved over the baseline, especially on extrapolation tasks, from 27mm to 13mm mean joint error. Our analyses highlight the impacts of: ensemble approaches, the use of a parametric 3D hand model (MANO), and different HPE methods/backbones.\"",

Visual inspection of our static baseline\u2019s failure cases shows that clear temporal effects on human gaze placement exist, but are both rare in the dataset and not captured by any of the recent video saliency models.

Keeping the much lower-dimensional feature embeddings of images reduces the memory footprint significantly. We assume that the model is updated incrementally for new classes as new data becomes available sequentially.This requires adapting the previously stored feature vectors to the updated feature space without having access to the corresponding original training images. Feature adaptation is learned with a multi-layer perceptron, which is trained on feature pairs corresponding to the outputs of the original and updated network on a training image. We validate experimentally that such a transformation generalizes well to the features of the previous set of classes, and maps features to a discriminative subspace in the feature space. As a result, the classifier is optimized jointly over new and old classes without requiring old class images. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy in incremental learning benchmarks, while having at least an order of magnitude lower memory footprint compared to image-preserving strategies.\"",

Surface reconstruction is a prerequisite for down-stream applications such as rendering, collision avoidance for planning, animation, etc. However, the task is challenging if the input point cloud has a low resolution, which is common in real-world scenarios (e.g., from LiDAR or Kinect sensors). Existing learning-based mesh generative methods mostly predict the surface by first building a shape embedding that is at the whole object level, a design that causes issues in generating fine-grained details and generalizing to unseen categories. Instead, we propose to leverage the input point cloud as much as possible, by only adding connectivity information to existing points. Particularly, we predict which triplets of points should form faces. Our key innovation is a surrogate of local connectivity, calculated by comparing the intrinsic/extrinsic metrics. We learn to predict this surrogate using a deep point cloud network and then feed it to an efficient post-processing module for high-quality mesh generation. We demonstrate that our method can not only preserve details, handle ambiguous structures, but also possess strong generalizability to unseen categories by experiments on synthetic and real data. \"",

In this work, we consider these two problems at the sametime. Specifically, we propose that better soft targets with higher compatibility can be generated by using a label generator to fuse the featuremaps from deeper stages in a top-down manner, and we can employ the meta-learning technique to optimize this label generator. Utilizing the soft targets learned from the intermediate feature maps of the model, we can achieve better self-boosting of the network in comparison with the state-of-the-art.

In this work, we propose a unifying framework of algorithms for Gaussian image deblurring and denoising. These algorithms are based on deep learning techniques for the design of learnable regularizers integrated into the Wiener-Kolmogorov filter. Our extensive experimentation line showcases that the proposed approach achieves a superior quality of image reconstruction and surpasses the solutions that rely either on deep learning or on optimization schemes alone. Augmented with the variance stabilizing transformation, the proposed reconstruction pipeline can also be successfully applied to the problem of Poisson image deblurring, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, several variants of the proposed framework demonstrate competitive performance at low computational complexity, which is of high importance for real-time imaging applications.\"",

        "abstract": "Modern object detection methods can be divided into one-stage approaches and two-stage ones. One-stage detectors are more efficient owing to straightforward architectures, but the two-stage detectors still take the lead in accuracy. Although recent work try to improve the one-stage detectors by imitating the structural design of the two-stage ones, the accuracy gap is still significant. In this paper, we propose MimicDet, a novel and efficient framework to train a one-stage detector by directly mimic the two-stage features, aiming to bridge the accuracy gap between one-stage and two-stage detectors. Unlike conventional mimic methods, MimicDet has a shared backbone for one-stage and two-stage detectors, then it branches into two heads which are well designed to have compatible features for mimicking. Thus MimicDet can be end-to-end trained without the pre-train of the teacher network. And the cost of memory does not increase much, which makes it practical to adopt large networks as backbones. We also make several specialized designs such as dual-path mimicking and staggered feature pyramid to facilitate the mimicking process. Experiments on the challenging COCO detection benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of MimicDet. It achieves 46.1 mAP with ResNeXt-101 backbone on the COCO test-dev set, which significantly surpasses current state-of-the-art methods.\"",

However, conventional adversarial training pushes two domains together and brings uncertainty to feature learning, which deteriorates the discriminability in the target domain. In this paper, we tackle this problem by designing a simple yet effective scheme, namely Asymmetric Adversarial Domain Adaptation (AADA). We notice that source features preserve great feature discriminability due to full supervision, and therefore a novel asymmetric training scheme is designed to keep the source features fixed and encourage the target features approaching to the source features, which best preserves the feature discriminability learned from source labeled data. This is achieved by an autoencoder-based domain discriminator that only embeds the source domain, while the feature extractor learns to deceive the autoencoder by embedding the target domain. Theoretical justifications corroborate that our method minimizes the domain discrepancy and spectral analysis is employed to quantize the improved feature discriminability. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks validate that our method outperforms existing adversarial domain adaptation methods significantly and demonstrates robustness with respect to hyper-parameter sensitivity.\"",

While for global shutter cameras, minimal solvers for the absolute camera pose and unknown focal length and radial distortion are available, solvers for the rolling shutter were missing. We present the first minimal solutions for the absolute pose of a rolling shutter camera with unknown rolling shutter parameters, focal length, and radial distortion. Our new minimal solvers combine iterative schemes designed for calibrated rolling shutter cameras with fast generalized eigenvalue and Groebner basis solvers. In a series of experiments, with both synthetic and real data, we show that our new solvers provide accurate estimates of the camera pose, rolling shutter parameters, focal length, and radial distortion parameters.\"",

        "abstract": "Domain Adaptation (DA) transfers a learning model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain which follows different distributions. There are a variety of DA scenarios subject to label sets and domain configurations, including closed-set and partial-set DA, as well as multi-source and multi-target DA. It is notable that existing DA methods are generally designed only for a specific scenario, and may underperform for scenarios they are not tailored to. In this paper, we propose Versatile Domain Adaptation (VDA), where one method can handle several different scenarios at the same time. Towards handling it, a more general inductive bias other than the domain alignment should be explored. We delve into a missing piece of existing methods: class confusion, the tendency that a classifier confuses the predictions between the correct and ambiguous classes for target examples, which exists in different scenarios. We unveil that reducing such pair-wise class confusion brings about significant transfer gains. Based on this, we propose a general loss function: Minimum Class Confusion (MCC). It can be characterized by (1) a non-adversarial DA method without explicitly deploying domain alignment, enjoying fast convergence speed; (2) a versatile approach that can handle the four existing scenarios: Closed-Set, Partial-Set, Multi-Source, and Multi-Target DA, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods in these scenarios, especially on the largest and hardest dataset to date (7.3% on DomainNet). Strong performance in the two scenarios proposed in this paper: Multi-Source Partial and Multi-Target Partial DA, further proves its versatility. In addition, it can also be used as a general regularizer that is orthogonal and complementary to a variety of existing DA methods, accelerating convergence and pushing those readily competitive methods to a stronger level. Code is released in https://github.com/thuml/MCC.\"",

        "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of learning semantic segmentation from image-level supervision only. Current popular solutions leverage object localization maps from classifiers as supervision signals, and struggle to make the localization maps capture more complete object content. Rather than previous efforts that primarily focus on intra-image information, we address the value of cross-image semantic relations for comprehensive object pattern mining. To achieve this, two neural co-attentions are incorporated into the classifier to complimentarily capture cross-image semantic similarities and differences. In particular, given a pair of training images, one co-attention enforces the classifier to recognize the common semantics from co-attentive objects, while the other one, called contrastive co-attention, drives the classifier to identify the unshared semantics from the rest, uncommon objects. This helps the classifier discover more object patterns and better ground semantics in image regions. In addition to boosting object pattern learning, the co-attention can leverage context from other related images to improve localization map inference, hence eventually benefiting semantic segmentation learning. More essentially, our algorithm provides a unified framework that handles well different WSSS settings, i.e., learning WSSS with (1) precise image-level supervision only, (2) extra simple single-label data, and (3) extra noisy web data. It sets new state-of-the-arts on all these settings, demonstrating well its efficacy and generalizability.\"",

To address the limitation, we propose a novel Inter-Video Proposal Relation module. Based on a concise multi-level triplet selection scheme, this module can learn effective object representations via modeling relations of hard proposals among different videos. Moreover, we design a Hierarchical Video Relation Network (HVR-Net), by integrating intra-video and inter-video proposal relations in a hierarchical fashion. This design can progressively exploit both intra and inter contexts to boost video object detection. We examine our method on the large-scale video object detection benchmark, i.e., ImageNet VID, where HVR-Net achieves the SOTA results. Codes and models will be released afterwards.\"",

Inspired by such artist-based modeling, we propose a two-step neural framework based on RL to learn 3D modeling policies. By taking actions and collecting rewards in an interactive environment, the agents first learn to parse a target shape into primitives and then to edit the geometry. To effectively train the modeling agents, we introduce a novel training algorithm that combines heuristic policy, imitation learning and reinforcement learning. Our experiments show that the agents can learn good policies to produce regular and structure-aware mesh models, which demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed RL framework.\"",

If an artist wishes to modify an earlier decision, significant work may be required to propagate this new decision forward to the final artwork. Motivated by the above observations, we propose a generative model that follows a given artistic workflow, enabling both multi-stage image generation as well as multi-stage image editing of an existing piece of art. Furthermore, for the editing scenario, we introduce an optimization process along with learning-based regularization to ensure the edited image produced by the model closely aligns with the originally provided image. Qualitative and quantitative results on three different artistic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on both image generation and editing tasks.\"",

Instead of using a generalized camera approach, we propose a novel approach to jointly optimize a traditional camera model, and a mathematical representation of the windshield\u2019s surface. First, using the laws of geometric optics, the refraction is modeled using a local spherical approximation to the windshield\u2019s geometry. Next, a spline-based model is proposed as a refinement to better adapt to deviations from the ideal shape and manufacturing variations. By jointly optimizing refraction and camera parameters, the projection error can be significantly reduced.

As one of the most popular normalization techniques, batch normalization (BN) has shown its e\ufb00ectiveness in accelerating the model training speed and improving model generalization capability. The success of BN has been explained from di\ufb00erent views, such as reducing internal covariate shift, allowing the use of large learning rate, smoothing optimization landscape, etc. To make a deeper understanding of BN, in this work we prove that BN actually introduces a certain level of noise into the sample mean and variance during the training process, while the noise level depends only on the batch size. Such a noise generation mechanism of BN regularizes the training process, and we present an explicit regularizer formulation of BN. Since the regularization strength of BN is determined by the batch size, a small batch size may cause the under-\ufb01tting problem, resulting in a less e\ufb00ective model. To reduce the dependency of BN on batch size, we propose a momentum BN (MBN) scheme by averaging the mean and variance of current mini-batch with the historical means and variances. With a dynamic momentum parameter, we can automatically control the noise level in the training process. As a result, MBN works very well even when the batch size is very small (e.g., 2), which is hard to achieve by traditional BN.\"",

        "abstract": "To understand how people look, interact, or perform tasks, we need to quickly and accurately capture their 3D body, face, and hands together from an RGB image. Most existing methods focus only on parts of the body. A few recent approaches reconstruct full expressive 3D humans from images using 3D body models that include the face and hands. These methods are optimization-based and thus slow, prone to local optima, and require 2D keypoints as input. We address these limitations by introducing ExPose (EXpressive POse and Shape rEgression), which directly regresses the body, face, and hands, in SMPL-X format, from an RGB image. This is a hard problem due to the high dimensionality of the body and the lack of expressive training data. Additionally, hands and faces are much smaller than the body, occupying very few image pixels. This makes hand and face estimation hard when body images are downscaled for neural networks. We make three main contributions. First, we account for the lack of training data by curating a dataset of SMPL-X fits on in-the-wild images. Second, we observe that body estimation localizes the face and hands reasonably well. We introduce body-driven attention for face and hand regions in the original image to extract higher-resolution crops that are fed to dedicated refinement modules. Third, these modules exploit part-specific knowledge from existing face and hand-only datasets. ExPose estimates expressive 3D humans more accurately than existing optimization methods at a small fraction of the computational cost.

Our system reconstructs a fully textured 3D human from each frame by leveraging Pixel-Aligned Implicit Function (PIFu). While PIFu achieves high-resolution reconstruction in a memory-efficient manner, its computationally expensive inference prevents us from deploying such a system for real-time applications. To this end, we propose a novel hierarchical surface localization algorithm and a direct rendering method without explicitly extracting surface meshes. By culling unnecessary regions for evaluation in a coarse-to-fine manner, we successfully accelerate the reconstruction by two orders of magnitude from the baseline without compromising the quality. Furthermore, we introduce an Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) technique that effectively suppresses failure modes due to the rare occurrence of challenging examples. We adaptively update the sampling probability of the training data based on the current reconstruction accuracy, which effectively alleviates reconstruction artifacts. Our experiments and evaluations demonstrate the robustness of our system to various challenging angles, illuminations, poses, and clothing styles. We also show that our approach compares favorably with state-of-the-art monocular performance capture.

Additionally, we extend two common methods, focusing on parameter and activation regularization, from the conventional single-classifier paradigm to MUC.

Under the setting of task-agnostic evaluation, our experimental results on CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet incremental benchmarks show that our method outperforms other baselines.

Even if these videos were recorded at different time instances, they would encode the same motion characteristics of the person. Therefore, we propose to capture human motion by jointly analyzing these Internet videos instead of using single videos separately. However, this new task poses many new challenges that cannot be addressed by existing methods, as the videos are unsynchronized, the camera viewpoints are unknown, the background scenes are different, and the human motions are not exactly the same among videos.

Most of previous works on adversarial attack mainly focus on image models, while the vulnerability of video models is less explored. In this paper, we aim to attack video models by utilizing intrinsic movement pattern and regional relative motion among video frames. We propose an effective motion-excited sampler to obtain motion-aware noise prior, which we term as sparked prior. Our sparked prior underlines frame correlations and utilizes video dynamics via relative motion. By using the sparked prior in gradient estimation, we can successfully attack a variety of video classification models with fewer number of queries. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets validate the efficacy of our proposed method. \"",

As the frame-by-frame optical flows require heavy computation, incorporating motion information has remained a major computational bottleneck for video understanding. In this work, we replace external and heavy computation of optical flows with internal and light-weight learning of motion features. We propose a trainable neural module, dubbed MotionSqueeze, for effective motion feature extraction. Inserted in the middle of any neural network, it learns to establish correspondences across frames and convert them into motion features, which are readily fed to the next downstream layer for better prediction. We demonstrate that the proposed method provides a significant gain on four standard benchmarks for action recognition with only a small amount of additional cost, outperforming the state of the art on Something-Something-V1&V2 datasets.\"",

In this process, inter- and intra-frames are the key sources for exploiting temporal and spatial information. However, there are a couple of limitations for existing VSR methods. First, optical flow is often used to establish one-on-one temporal correspondences. But flow estimation itself is error-prone and hence largely affects the ultimate recovery result. Second, similar patterns existing in natural images are rarely exploited for the VSR task. Motivated by these findings, we propose a temporal multi-correspondence aggregation strategy to leverage most similar patches across frames, and also a cross-scale nonlocal-correspondence aggregation scheme to explore self-similarity of images across scales. Based on these two novel modules, we build an effective multi-correspondence aggregation network (MuCAN) for VSR. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark datasets.

To this end, we propose a Multi-scale Positive Sample Refinement (MPSR) approach to enrich object scales in FSOD. It generates multi-scale positive samples as object pyramids and refines the prediction at various scales. We demonstrate its advantage by integrating it as an auxiliary branch to the popular architecture of Faster R-CNN with FPN, delivering a strong FSOD solution.

Recently, the notion of single-source open-set domain adaptation (OSDA) has drawn much attention which considers the presence of previously unseen open-set (unknown) classes in the target-domain in addition to the source-domain closed-set (known) classes. It is reasonable to assume that labeled samples may be distributed over multiple source-domains while the target-domain is equipped with both the closed-set and open-set data. However, the existing single-source OSDA techniques cannot be directly extended to such a multi-source scenario considering the inhomogeneities present among the different source-domains. As a remedy, we propose a novel adversarial learning-driven approach to deal with the MS-OSDA setup. Precisely, we model a shared feature space for all the domains while encouraging fine-grained alignment among the known-class samples. Besides, an adversarial learning strategy is followed to model the discriminator between the target-domain known and unknown classes. We validate our method on the Office-31, Office-Home, Office-CalTech, and Digits datasets and find our model to consistently outperform the relevant literature.\"",

Here, we investigate a novel alternative approach to MS, called multi-temporal (MT), for non-uniform single image deblurring by exploiting time-resolved deblurring dataset from high-speed cameras. MT approach models severe blurs as a series of small blurs so that it deblurs small amount of blurs in the original spatial scale progressively instead of restoring the images in different spatial scales.

Our MT approach, that can be seen as a form of curriculum learning in a wide sense, allows a number of state-of-the-art MS based deblurring methods to yield improved performances without using MS approach.

Our proposed method naturally complements the traditional feature extraction and matching paradigm. We first estimate local geometric transformations between tentative matches and then optimize the keypoint locations over multiple views jointly according to a non-linear least squares formulation.

Our main observation is that enhancing the perceptual quality mostly relies on recovering the high-frequency sub-bands in wavelet domain. Accordingly, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) based on multi-level wavelet packet transform (WPT) to enhance the perceptual quality of compressed videos, which is called multi-level wavelet-based GAN (MW-GAN). In the MW-GAN, we first apply motion compensation with a pyramid architecture to obtain temporal information. Then, we propose a wavelet reconstruction network with wavelet-dense residual blocks (WDRB) to recover the high-frequency details. In addition, the adversarial loss of MW-GAN is added via WPT to further encourage high-frequency details recovery for video frames.

Most of the existing methods for this caption-to-video retrieval problem do not fully exploit cross-modal cues present in video. Furthermore, they aggregate per-frame visual features with limited or no temporal information. In this paper, we present a multi-modal transformer to jointly encode the different modalities in video, which allows each of them to attend to the others. The transformer architecture is also leveraged to encode and model the temporal information. On the natural language side, we investigate the best practices to jointly optimize the language embedding together with the multi-modal transformer. This novel framework allows us to establish state-of-the-art results for video retrieval on three datasets. More details are available at http://thoth.inrialpes.fr/research/MMT.\"",

        "abstract": "Epipolar constraints are at the core of feature matching and depth estimation in current multi-person multi-camera 3D human pose estimation methods. Despite the satisfactory performance of this formulation in sparser crowd scenes, its effectiveness is frequently challenged under denser crowd circumstances mainly due to two sources of ambiguity. The first is the mismatch of human joints resulting from the simple cues provided by the Euclidean distances between joints and epipolar lines. The second is the lack of robustness from the naive formulation of the problem as a least squares minimization. In this paper, we depart from the multi-person 3D pose estimation formulation, and instead reformulate it as crowd pose estimation. Our method consists of two key components: a graph model for fast cross-view matching, and a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator for the reconstruction of the 3D human poses. We demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method on four benchmark datasets.\"",

Most of the existing approaches utilize pose information for multi-view action recognition. We focus on RGB modality instead and propose an unsupervised representation learning framework, which encodes the scene dynamics in videos captured from multiple viewpoints via predicting actions from unseen views. The framework takes multiple short video clips from different viewpoints and time as input and learns a global internal representation which is used to predict a video clip from an unseen viewpoint and time. The ability of the proposed network to render unseen video frames enables it to learn a meaningful and robust representation of the scene dynamics. We evaluate the effectiveness of the learned representation for multi-view video action recognition in a supervised approach. We observe a significant improvement in the performance with RGB modality on NTU-RGB+D dataset, which is the largest dataset for multi-view action recognition. The proposed framework also achieves state-of-the-art results with depth modality, which validates the generalization capability of the approach to other data modalities.

Based on our findings, we propose a new mathematical formulation of memorability decay, resulting in a model that is able to produce the first quantitative estimation of how a video decays in memory over time. In contrast with previous work, our model can predict the probability that a video will be remembered at an arbitrary delay. Importantly, our approach combines visual and semantic information (in the form of textual captions) to fully represent the meaning of events. Our experiments on two video memorability benchmarks, including Memento10k, show that our model significantly improves upon the best prior approach (by 12% on average). \"",

Hence, we pose a multi-modal shape completion problem, in which we seek to complete the partial shape with multiple outputs by learning a one-to-many mapping. We develop the first multimodal shape completion method that completes the partial shape via conditional generative modeling, without requiring paired training data. Our approach distills the ambiguity by conditioning the completion on a learned multimodal distribution of possible results. We extensively evaluate the approach on several datasets that contain varying forms of shape incompleteness, and compare among several baseline methods and variants of our methods qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating the merit of our method in completing partial shapes with both diversity and quality.\"",

For such cases, the novelty detection models risk detecting a known class as novel due to the dataset distribution shift. This scenario is often ignored while working with novelty detection. To this end, we consider the problem of multiple class novelty detection under dataset distribution shift to improve the novelty detection performance. Firstly, we discuss the problem setting in detail and show how it affects the performance of current novelty detection methods. Secondly, we show that one could improve those novelty detection methods with a simple integration of domain adversarial loss. Finally, we propose a method which brings together the techniques from novelty detection and domain adaptation to improve generalization of multiple class novelty detection on different domains. We evaluate the proposed method on digits and object recognition datasets and show that it provides improvements over the baseline methods.\"",

In a multiview detection system, we need to answer two important questions. First, how should we aggregate cues from multiple views? Second, how should we aggregate information from spatially neighboring locations? To address these questions, we introduce a novel multiview detector, MVDet. During multiview aggregation, for each location on the ground, existing methods use multiview anchor box features as representation, which potentially limits performance as pre-defined anchor boxes can be inaccurate. In contrast, via feature map perspective transformation, MVDet employs anchor-free representations with feature vectors directly sampled from corresponding pixels in multiple views. For spatial aggregation, different from previous methods that require design and operations outside of neural networks, MVDet takes a fully convolutional approach with large convolutional kernels on the multiview aggregated feature map. The proposed model is end-to-end learnable and achieves 88.2% MODA on Wildtrack dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art by 14.1%. We also provide detailed analysis of MVDet on a newly introduced synthetic dataset, MultiviewX, which allows us to control the level of occlusion.

        "abstract": "Recent work has shown that the structure of deep convolutional neural networks can be used as a structured image prior for solving various inverse image restoration tasks. Instead of using hand-designed architectures, we propose to search for neural architectures that capture stronger image priors. Building upon a generic U-Net architecture, our core contribution lies in designing new search spaces for (1) an upsampling cell and (2) a pattern of cross-scale residual connections. We search for an improved network by leveraging an existing neural architecture search algorithm (using reinforcement learning with a recurrent neural network controller). We validate the effectiveness of our method via a wide variety of applications, including image restoration, dehazing, image-to-image translation, and matrix factorization. Extensive experimental results show that our algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art learning-free approaches and reaches competitive performance with existing learning-based methods in some cases.\"",

Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed method on six diverse non-standard datasets, e.g. STL-10, Flowers102, Oxford Pets, FGVC Aircrafts etc. In all cases, NSGANetV2s improve the state-of-the-art (under mobile setting), suggesting that NAS can be a viable alternative to conventional transfer learning approaches in handling diverse scenarios such as small-scale or fine-grained datasets.

        "abstract": "Supervised learning in large discriminative models is a mainstay for modern computer vision. Such an approach necessitates investing in large-scale human-annotated datasets for achieving state-of-the-art results. In turn, the efficacy of supervised learning may be limited by the size of the human annotated dataset. This limitation is particularly notable for image segmentation tasks, where the expense of human annotation is especially large, yet large amounts of unlabeled data may exist. In this work, we ask if we may leverage semi-supervised learning in unlabeled video sequences and extra images to improve the performance on urban scene segmentation, simultaneously tackling semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation. The goal of this work is to avoid the construction of sophisticated, learned architectures specific to label propagation (e.g., patch matching and optical flow). Instead, we simply predict pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data and train subsequent models with both human-annotated and pseudo-labeled data. The procedure is iterated for several times. As a result, our Naive-Student model, trained with such simple yet effective iterative semi-supervised learning, attains state-of-the-art results at all three Cityscapes benchmarks, reaching the performance of 67.8% PQ, 42.6% AP, and 85.2% mIOU on the test set. We view this work as a notable step towards building a simple procedure to harness unlabeled video sequences and extra images to surpass state-of-the-art performance on core computer vision tasks.\"",

We synthesize views by querying 5D coordinates along camera rays and use classic volume rendering techniques to project the output colors and densities into an image. Because volume rendering is naturally differentiable, the only input required to optimize our representation is a set of images with known camera poses. We describe how to effectively optimize neural radiance fields to render photorealistic novel views of scenes with complicated geometry and appearance, and demonstrate results that outperform prior work on neural rendering and view synthesis. View synthesis results are best viewed as videos, so we urge readers to view our supplementary video for convincing comparisons. We will make our code and data available upon publication.\"",

If the estimated class rate is higher than that of the annotated class rate, we generate negative pseudo labels, which indicate, ``input image does not belong to this negative label,'' in addition to standard pseudo labels.

        "abstract": "Multiple rotation averaging is an essential task for structure from motion, mapping, and robot navigation. The task is to estimate the absolute orientations of several cameras given some of their noisy relative orientation measurements. The conventional methods for this task seek parameters of the absolute orientations that agree best with the observed noisy measurements according to a robust cost function. These robust cost functions are highly nonlinear and are designed based on certain assumptions about the noise and outlier distributions. In this work, we aim to build a neural network that learns the noise patterns from the data and predict/regress the model parameters from the noisy relative orientations. The proposed network is a combination of two networks: (1) a view-graph cleaning network, which detects outlier edges in the view-graph and rectifies noisy measurements; and (2) a fine-tuning network, which fine-tunes an initialization of absolute orientations bootstrapped from the cleaned graph, in a single step. The proposed combined network is very fast, moreover, being trained on a large number of synthetic graphs, it is more accurate than the conventional iterative optimization methods. Although the idea of replacing robust optimization methods by a graph-based network is demonstrated only for multiple rotation averaging, it could easily be extended to other graph-based geometric problems, for example, pose-graph optimization. \"",

        "abstract": "We are interested in the detection and segmentation of anomalies in images where the anomalies are typically small (i.e., a small tear in woven fabric, broken pin of an IC chip). From a statistical learning point of view, anomalies have low occurrence probability and are not from the main modes of a data distribution. Learning a generative model of anomalous data from a natural distribution of data can be difficult because the data distribution is heavily skewed towards a large amount of non-anomalous data. When training a generative model on such imbalanced data using an iterative learning algorithm like stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we observe an expected yet interesting trend in the loss values (a measure of the learned models performance) after each gradient update across data samples. Naturally, as the model sees more non-anomalous data during training, the loss values over a non-anomalous data sample decreases, while the loss values on an anomalous data sample fluctuates. In this work, our key hypothesis is that this change in loss values during training can be used as a feature to identify anomalous data. In particular, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm for anomaly detection and segmentation using an anomaly classifier that uses as input the extit{loss profile} of a data sample processed through an autoencoder. The loss profile is defined as a sequence of reconstruction loss values produced during iterative training. To amplify the difference in loss profiles between anomalous and non-anomalous data, we also introduce a Reinforcement Learning based meta-algorithm, which we call the neural batch sampler, to strategically sample training batches during autoencoder training. Experimental results on multiple datasets with a high diversity of textures and objects, often with multiple modes of defects within them, demonstrate the capabilities and effectiveness of our method when compared with existing state-of-the-art baselines.\"",

Unlike previous neural approaches that rely only on semantic cues obtained from neural networks, our approach considers both semantic and geometric cues, resulting in significant accuracy improvement. The proposed framework consists of two networks. Using line segments of an image as geometric cues, the first network estimates the zenith vanishing point and generates several candidates consisting of the camera rotation and focal length. The second network evaluates each candidate based on the given image and the geometric cues, where prior knowledge of man-made scenes is used for the evaluation. With the supervision of datasets consisting of the horizontal line and focal length of the images, our networks can be trained to estimate the same camera parameters. Based on the Manhattan world assumption, we can further estimate the camera rotation and focal length in a weakly supervised manner. The experimental results reveal that the performance of our neural approach is significantly higher than that of existing state-of-the-art camera calibration techniques for single images of indoor and outdoor scenes.\"",

Unlike existing supervised translation methods that require model-level similarity to preserve consistent structure representation for both real images and fake renderings, our method adopts an unsupervised solution to work on arbitrary hair models. The key component of our method is a shared latent space to encode appearance-invariant structure information of both domains, which generates realistic renderings conditioned by extra appearance inputs. This is achieved by domain-specific pre-disentangled structure representation, partially shared domain encoder layers and a structure discriminator. We also propose a simple yet effective temporal conditioning method to enforce consistency for video sequence generation. We demonstrate the superiority of our method by testing it on a large number of portraits and comparing it with alternative baselines and state-of-the-art unsupervised image translation methods.\"",

This paper proposes a method, Neural Object Learning (NOL), that creates synthetic images of objects in arbitrary poses by combining only a few observations from cluttered images. A novel refinement step is proposed to align inaccurate poses of objects in source images, which results in better quality images. Evaluations performed on two public datasets show that the rendered images created by NOL lead to state-of-the-art performance in comparison to methods that use 13 times the number of real images. Evaluations on our new dataset show multiple objects can be trained and recognized simultaneously using a sequence of a fixed scene. \"",

A deep rendering network is learned in parallel with the descriptors, so that new views of the scene can be obtained by passing the rasterizations of a point cloud from new viewpoints through this network. The input rasterizations use the learned descriptors as point pseudo-colors. We show that the proposed approach can be used for modeling complex scenes and obtaining their photorealistic views, while avoiding explicit surface estimation and meshing.

Our algorithm represents body pose and shape as a para-metric mesh which can be reconstructed from a single image and easilyreposed.

This rich implicit representation captures detailed appearance vari-ation across poses, viewpoints, person identities and clothing styles bet-ter than learned color texture maps. The body model with the renderedfeature-maps is fed through a neural image-translation network that cre-ates the final rendered color image. The above components are combinedin an end-to-end-trained neural network architecture that takes as in-put a source person image, and images of the parametric body modelin the source pose and desired target pose.

However, unlike a full design file, a wireframe model lacks critical information, such as detailed shape, texture, and materials, needed by a conventional renderer to produce 2D renderings of the objects or scenes. In this paper, we bridge the information gap by generating photo-realistic rendering of indoor scenes from wireframe models in an image translation framework. While existing image synthesis methods can generate visually pleasing images for common objects such as faces and birds, these methods do not explicitly model and preserve essential structural constraints in a wireframe model, such as junctions, parallel lines, and planar surfaces. To this end, we propose a novel model based on a structure-appearance joint representation learned from both images and wireframes. In our model, structural constraints are explicitly enforced by learning a joint representation in a shared encoder network that must support the generation of both images and wireframes. Experiments on a wireframe-scene dataset show that our wireframe-to-image translation model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and structural integrity of generated images.\"",

        "abstract": "The introduction of non-local blocks to the traditional CNN architecture enhances its performance for various computer vision tasks by improving its capabilities of capturing long range dependencies. However, the usage of non-local blocks may also introduce new threats to computer vision systems. Therefore, it is important to study the threats caused by non-local blocks before directly applying them to commercial systems. In this paper, two new threats named disappearing attack and appearing attack against object detectors with a non-local block are investigated. The former aims at misleading an object detector with a non-local block such that it is unable to detect a target object category while the latter aims at misleading the object detector such that it detects a predefined object category, which is not present in images. Different from the existing attacks against object detectors, these threats are able to be performed in long range cases. This means that the target object and the universal adversarial patches learned from the proposed algorithms can have long distance between them. To examine the threats, digital and physical experiments are conducted on Faster R-CNN with a non-local block and 6331 images from 56 videos. The experiments show that the universal patches are able to mislead the detector with greater probabilities. To explain the threats from non-local blocks, the reception fields of CNN models with and without non-local blocks are studied empirically and theoretically.\"",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of nighttime defogging from a single image. We propose a framework consisting of two main modules: grayscale and color modules. Given an RGB foggy nighttime image, our grayscale module takes the grayscale version of the image as input, and decomposes it into high and low frequency layers. The high frequency layer contains the scene texture information, which is less affected by fog; and, the low frequency layer contains the scene layout/structure information including fog and glow. Our grayscale module then enhances the visibility of the textures in the high frequency layers, and removes the presence of glow and fog in the low frequency layers. Having processed the high/low frequency information, it fuses the layers to obtain a grayscale defogged image. Our second module, the color module, takes the original RGB image as input. The module has similar operations to those of the grayscale module. However, to obtain fog-free high and low frequency information, the module is guided by the grayscale module. The reason of doing this is because grayscale images are less affected by multiple colors of atmospheric light, which are commonly present in nighttime scenes. Moreover, having the grayscale module allows us to have consistency losses between the outputs of the two modules, which is critical to our framework, since we do not have paired ground-truths for our real data. Our extensive experiments on real foggy nighttime images show the effectiveness of our method.\"",

We construct a dependence model to estimate the posterior probability of an instance being incorrectly labeled given the dataset, and rank instances based on their estimated probabilities.

The initial depth prediction is then iteratively refined by its confidence and non-local spatial propagation procedure based on the predicted non-local neighbors and corresponding affinities. Unlike previous algorithms that utilize fixed-local neighbors, the proposed algorithm effectively avoids irrelevant local neighbors and concentrates on relevant non-local neighbors during propagation. In addition, we introduce a learnable affinity normalization to better learn the affinity combinations compared to conventional methods. The proposed algorithm is inherently robust to the mixed-depth problem on depth boundaries, which is one of the major issues for existing depth estimation/completion algorithms. Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to conventional algorithms in terms of depth completion accuracy and robustness to the mixed-depth problem.\"",

The final model was then generated by simply combining the front-view and back-view RGB-D information. However, inferring back-view RGB-D image with high-quality geometric details and plausible texture is not trivial. Our key observation is: Normal maps generally encode much more information of 3D surface details than RGB and depth images. Therefore, learning geometric details from normal maps is superior than other representations. In NormalGAN, an adversarial learning framework conditioned by normal maps is introduced, which is used to not only improve the front-view depth denoising performance, but also infer back-view depth image with surprisingly geometric details. Moreover, for texture recovery, we remove shading information from the front-view RGB image based on the refined normal map, which further improves the quality of the back-view color inference. Results and experiments on both testing data set and real captured data demonstrate the superior performance of our approach. Given a consumer RGB-D sensor, NormalGAN can generate the complete and detailed 3D human reconstruction results in 20 fps, which further enables convenient interactive experiences in telepresence, AR/VR and gaming scenarios. \"",

However, previous work are either superficial, e.g., classification of short-clips, and the single scenario, or undersupplied, e.g., the single modality, and hand-crafted features based multimodality. To address this problem, in this work we first release a large-scale and multi-scene dataset named XD-Violence with a total duration of 217 hours, containing 4754 untrimmed videos with audio signals and weak labels. Then we propose a neural network containing three parallel branches to capture different relations among video snippets and integrate features, where holistic branch captures long-range dependencies using similarity prior, localized branch captures local positional relation using proximity prior, and score branch dynamically captures the closeness of predicted score. Besides, our method also includes an approximator to meet the needs of online detection. Our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on our released dataset and other existing benchmark. Moreover, extensive experimental results also show the positive effect of multimodal (audio-visual) input and modeling relationships.

This paper proposes a view translation model within cVAE-GAN framework for the purpose of unpaired training. We design a conditional deformable module (CDM) which uses the source (or target) view condition vectors as the filters to convolve the feature maps from the main branch. It generates several pairs of displacement maps like the 2D optical flows. The flows then deform the features, and the results are given to the main branch of the encoder (or decoder) by the deformed feature based normalization module (DFNM). DFNM scales and offsets the feature maps in the main branch given its deformed input from the side branch. With the CDM and DFNM, the encoder outputs a view-irrelevant posterior, while the decoder takes the sample drawn from it to synthesize the reconstructed and the view-translated images. To further ensure the disentanglement between the views and other factors, we add adversarial training on the code drawn from the view-irrelevant posterior. The results and the ablation study on MultiPIE and 3D chair datasets validate the effectiveness of the whole framework and the designed module.\"",

Even a small amount of outliers can dramatically degrade the quality of the estimated blur kernel, because the outliers are not conforming to the linear formation of the blurring process. Prior arts develop sophisticated edge-selecting steps or noise filtering pre-processing steps to deal with outliers (i.e. indirect approaches). However, these indirect approaches may fail when massive outliers are presented, since informative details may be polluted by outliers or erased during the pre-processing steps. To address these problems, this paper develops a simple yet effective Outlier Identifying and Discarding (OID) method, which alleviates limitations in existing Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)- based deblurring models when significant outliers are presented. Unlike previous indirect outlier processing methods, OID tackles outliers directly by explicitly identifying and discarding them, when updating both the latent image and the blur kernel during the deblurring process, where the outliers are detected by using the sparse and entropy-based modules. OID is easy to implement and extendable for non-blind restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of OID against recent works both quantitatively and qualitatively.\"",

The practical benefits of such an object detector are obvious and significant---application-relevant categories can be picked and merged form arbitrary existing datasets. However, naive merging of datasets is not possible in this case, due to inconsistent object annotations. Consider an object category like faces that is annotated in one dataset, but is not annotated in another dataset, although the object itself appears in the later's images. Some categories, like face here, would thus be considered foreground in one dataset, but background in another. To address this challenge, we design a framework which works with such partial annotations, and we exploit a pseudo labeling approach that we adapt for our specific case. We propose loss functions that carefully integrate partial but correct annotations with complementary but noisy pseudo labels. Evaluation in the proposed novel setting requires full annotation on the test set. We collect the required annotations and define a new challenging experimental setup for this task based on existing public datasets.

        "abstract": "Accurate 3D object detection in LiDAR based point clouds suffers from the challenges of data sparsity and irregularities. Existing methods strive to organize the points regularly, e.g. voxelize, pass them through a designed 2D/3D neural network, and then define object-level anchors that predict offsets of 3D bounding boxes using collective evidences from all the points on the objects of interest. Contrary to the state-of-the-art anchor-based methods, based on the very nature of data sparsity, we observe that even points on an individual object part are informative about semantic information of the object. We thus argue in this paper for an approach opposite to existing methods using object-level anchors. Inspired by compositional models, which represent an object as parts and their spatial relations, we propose to represent an object as composition of its interior non-empty voxels, termed hotspots, and the spatial relations of hotspots. This gives rise to the representation of Object as Hotspots (OHS). Based on OHS, we further propose an anchor-free detection head with a novel ground truth assignment strategy that deals with inter-object point-sparsity imbalance to prevent the network from biasing towards objects with more points. Experimental results show that our proposed method works remarkably well on objects with a small number of points. Notably, our approach ranked 1st on KITTI 3D Detection Benchmark for cyclist and pedestrian detection, and achieved state-of-the-art performance on NuScenes 3D Detection Benchmark.\"",

First, we learn object regions under the supervision of the ground-truth segmentation. Second, we compute the object region representation by aggregating the representations of the pixels lying in the object region. Last, % the representation similarity we compute the relation between each pixel and each object region, and augment the representation of each pixel with the object-contextual representation which is a weighted aggregation of all the object region representations according to their relations with the pixel.

        "abstract": "Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is unique in that it requires turning relatively general natural-language instructions into robot agent actions, on the basis of visible environments. This requires to extract value from two very different types of natural-language information. The first is object description (e.g., `table', `door'), each presenting as a tip for the agent to determine the next action by finding the item visible in the environment, and the second is action specification (e.g., `go straight', `turn left') which allows the robot to directly predict the next movements without relying on visual perceptions. However, most existing methods pay few attention to distinguish these information from each other during instruction encoding and mix together the matching between textual object/action encoding and visual perception/orientation features of candidate viewpoints. In this paper, we propose an Object-and-Action Aware Model (OAAM) that processes these two different forms of natural language based instruction separately. This enables each process to match object-centered/action-centered instruction to their own counterpart visual perception/action orientation flexibly. However, one side-issue caused by above solution is that an object mentioned in instructions may be observed in the direction of two or more candidate viewpoints, thus the OAAM may not predict the viewpoint on the shortest path as the next action. To handle this problem, we design a simple but effective path loss to penalize trajectories deviating from the ground truth path. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and path loss, and the superiority of their combination with a 50% SPL score on the R2R dataset and a 40% CLS score on the R4R dataset in unseen environments, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art.\"",

This results in a rendering-aware system that estimates the local illumination distribution at an object with high accuracy and in real time.

        "abstract": "We present a new learning-based method for multi-frame depth estimation from a color video, which is a fundamental problem in scene understanding, robot navigation or handheld 3D reconstruction. While recent learning-based methods estimate depth at high accuracy, 3D point clouds exported from their depth maps often fail to preserve important geometric feature (e.g., corners, edges, planes) of man-made scenes. Widely-used pixel-wise depth errors do not specifically penalize inconsistency on these features. These inaccuracies are particularly severe when subsequent depth reconstructions are accumulated in an attempt to scan a full environment with man-made objects with this kind of features. Our depth estimation algorithm therefore introduces a Combined Normal Map (CNM) constraint, which is designed to better preserve high-curvature features and global planar regions. In order to further improve the depth estimation accuracy, we introduce a new occlusion-aware strategy that aggregates initial depth predictions from multiple adjacent views into one final depth map and occlusion probability map for the current reference view. With the CNM constraint and the occlusion-aware loss, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of depth estimation accuracy, and preserves essential geometric features of man-made indoor scenes much better than other algorithms.\"",

To conquer this dilemma, we propose an occlusion-aware siamese network to improve the performance. Specifically, we introduce scheme of feature erasing and reconstruction. Firstly, we utilize attention mechanism to predict the occlusion-aware attention map which is explicitly supervised and clean the feature map which is contaminated by different types of occlusions. Nevertheless, the cleaning procedure not only removes the useless information but also erases some valuable details. To overcome the defects caused by the erasing operation, we perform feature reconstruction to recover the information destroyed by occlusion and details lost in cleaning procedure. To make reconstructed features more precise and informative, we adopt siamese network equipped with OT divergence to guide the features of occluded images towards those of the un-occluded images.

In doing so, the agent builds its spatial awareness more rapidly, which facilitates efficient exploration and navigation in 3D environments. By exploiting context in both the egocentric views and top-down maps our model successfully anticipates a broader map of the environment, with performance significantly better than strong baselines.

        "abstract": "Anchor-based Siamese trackers have achieved remarkable advancements in accuracy, yet the further improvement is restricted by the lagged tracking robustness. We find the underlying reason is that the regression network in anchor-based methods is only trained on the positive anchor boxes ($IoU \\geq 0.6$). This mechanism makes it difficult to refine the anchors whose overlap with the target objects are small. In this paper, we propose a novel object-aware anchor-free network to address this issue. First, instead of refining the reference anchor boxes, we directly predict the position and scale of target objects in an anchor-free fashion. Since each pixel in the groundtruth box is well trained, the tracker is capable of rectifying the weak predictions of target objects during inference. Second, we introduce a feature alignment module to learn an object-aware feature which corresponds with the predicted bounding box. The object-aware feature can further contribute to the classification of target object and background. Moreover, we present a novel Siamese tracking framework based on the anchor-free model. The experiments show that our anchor-free tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks, including VOT-2018, VOT-2019, OTB-100, GOT-10k and LaSOT.

OmniSource overcomes the barriers between data formats, such as images, short videos, and long untrimmed videos for webly-supervised learning. First, data samples with multiple formats, curated by task-specific data collection and automatically filtered by a teacher model, are transformed into a unified form. Then a joint-training strategy is proposed to deal with the domain gaps between multiple data sources and formats in webly-supervised learning. Several good practices, including data balancing, resampling, and cross-dataset mixup are adopted in joint training. Experiments show that by utilizing data from multiple sources and formats, OmniSource is more data-efficient in training. With only 3.5M images and 800K minutes videos crawled from the internet without human labeling (less than 2% of prior works), our models learned with OmniSource improve Top-1 accuracy of 2D- and 3D-ConvNet baseline models by 3.0% and 3.9%, respectively, on the Kinetics-400 benchmark. With OmniSource, we establish new records with different pretraining strategies for video recognition.

Designing a generic anti-spoofing model to estimate those spoof traces can improve not only the generalization of the spoof detection, but also the interpretability of the model\u2019s decision. Yet, this is a challenging task due to the diversity of spoof types and the lack of ground truth in spoof traces. This work designs a novel adversarial learning framework to disentangle the spoof traces from input faces as a hierarchical combination of patterns at multiple scales. With the disentangled spoof traces, we unveil the live counterpart of the original spoof face, and further synthesize realistic new spoof faces after a proper geometric correction.

However, the information of individually zeroed entries could still present in other correlated entries by propagating (1) spatially between entries of different node feature vectors and (2) depth-wisely between different entries of each node feature vector, which essentially weakens the effectiveness of dropout. This is mainly because in a GCN, neighboring node feature vectors after linear transformations are aggregated to produce new node feature vectors in the subsequent layer. To effectively regularize GCNs, we devise DropCluster which first randomly zeros some seed entries and then zeros entries that are spatially or depth-wisely correlated to those seed entries. In this way, the information of the seed entries is thoroughly removed and cannot flow to subsequent layers via the correlated entries. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed DropCluster by comprehensively comparing it with dropout and its representative variants, such as SpatialDropout, Gaussian dropout and DropEdge, on skeleton-based action recognition.\"",

        "abstract": "Motion segmentation, i.e., the problem of clustering data in multiple images based on different 3D motions, is an important task for reconstructing and understanding dynamic scenes. In this paper we address motion segmentation in multiple images by combining partial results coming from triplets of images, which are obtained by fitting a number of trifocal tensors to correspondences. We exploit the fact that the trifocal tensor is a stronger model than the fundamental matrix, as it provides fewer but more reliable matches over three images than fundamental matrices provide over the two. We also consider an alternative solution which merges partial results coming from both triplets and pairs of images, showing the strength of three-frame segmentation in a combination with two-frame segmentation. Our real experiments on standard as well as new datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy of the proposed approaches when compared to previous techniques.\"",

Our task is to detect/classify if a CNN model has been maliciously inserted with an unknown Trojan trigger or not. Here, each CNN model is associated with a signature that is created by generating, pixel-by-pixel, an adversarial value that is the result of the largest change to the class prediction. The one-pixel signature is agnostic to the design choice of CNN architectures, and how they were trained. It can be computed efficiently for a black-box CNN model without accessing the network parameters. Our proposed one-pixel signature demonstrates a substantial improvement (by around $30\\%$ in the absolute detection accuracy) over the existing competing methods for backdoored CNN detection/classification. One-pixel signature is a general representation that can be used to characterize CNN models beyond backdoor detection.\"",

        "abstract": "Despite impressive progress in object detection over the last years, it is still an open challenge to reliably detect objects across visual domains. Although the topic has attracted attention recently, current approaches all rely on the ability to access a sizable amount of target data for use at training time. This is a heavy assumption, as often it is not possible to anticipate the domain where a detector will be used, nor to access it in advance for data acquisition. Consider for instance the task of monitoring a feed of images from social media: as each image is created and uploaded by a different user, each belongs to a different target domain that is impossible to foresee during training. This paper addresses this setting, presenting an object detection algorithm able to perform unsupervised adaption across domains by using only one target sample, seen at test time. We achieve this by introducing a multi-task architecture that one-shot adapts to any incoming sample by iteratively solving a self-supervised task on it. We further enhance this auxiliary adaptation with cross-task pseudo-labeling. A thorough benchmark analysis against the most recent cross-domain detection methods and a detailed ablation study show the advantage of our method, which sets the state-of-the-art in the defined one-shot scenario. \"",

As most, if not all, previous CL methods violate these constraints, we propose an algorithmic solution to MC-OCL: Batch-level Distillation (BLD), a regularization-based CL approach which effectively balances stability and plasticity in order to learn from data streams, while preserving the ability to solve old tasks through distillation.

A limitation of current feature descriptors is the trade-off between generalization and discriminative power: more invariance means less informative descriptors. We propose to overcome this limitation with a disentanglement of invariance in local descriptors and with an online selection of the most appropriate invariance given the context. Our framework consists in a joint learning of multiple local descriptors with different levels of invariance and of meta descriptors encoding the regional variations of an image. The similarity of these meta descriptors across images is used to select the right invariance when matching the local descriptors. Our approach, named Local Invariance Selection at Runtime for Descriptors (LISRD), enables descriptors to adapt to adverse changes in images, while remaining discriminative when invariance is not required. We demonstrate that our method can boost the performance of current descriptors and outperforms state-of-the-art descriptors in several matching tasks, when evaluated on challenging datasets with day-night illumination as well as viewpoint changes.\"",

Many methods have been proposed to address this problem through different ways to minimise the domain shift between source and target datasets. In this paper we take an orthogonal perspective and propose a framework to further enhance performance by meta-learning the initial conditions of existing DA algorithms. This is challenging compared to the more widely considered setting of few-shot meta-learning, due to the length of the computation graph involved. Therefore we propose an online shortest-path meta-learning framework that is both computationally tractable and practically effective for improving DA performance. We present variants for both multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation (MSDA), and semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA). Importantly, our approach is agnostic to the base adaptation algorithm, and can be applied to improve many techniques. Experimentally, we demonstrate improvements on classic (DANN) and recent (MCD and MME) techniques for MSDA and SSDA, and ultimately achieve state of the art results on several DA benchmarks including the largest scale DomainNet.\"",

Recently, great advances have been made in searching for optimal augmentation policies in the image classification domain. However, two key points related to data augmentation remain uncovered by the current methods. First is that most if not all modern augmentation search methods are extit{offline} where learning policies are isolated from their usage. The learned policies are mostly constant throughout the training process and are extit{not adapted} to the current training model state. Second, the policies rely on class-preserving image processing functions. Hence applying current offline methods to new tasks may require domain knowledge to specify such kind of operations. In this work, we offer an orthogonal extit{online} data augmentation scheme together with three new augmentation networks, co-trained with the target learning task. It is both more efficient, in the sense that it does not require expensive offline training when entering a new domain, and more adaptive as it adapts to the learner state. Our augmentation networks require less domain knowledge and are easily applicable to new tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme alone performs on par with the state-of-the-art offline data augmentation methods, as well as improving upon the state-of-the-art in combination with those methods.\"",

The objective of open-set recognition is to identify samples from open-set classes during testing, while adversarial defense aims to defend the network against images with imperceptible adversarial perturbations. In this paper, we show that open-set recognition systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Furthermore, we show that adversarial defense mechanisms trained on known classes do not generalize well to open-set samples. Motivated by this observation, we emphasize the need of an Open-Set Adversarial Defense (OSAD) mechanism. This paper proposes an Open-Set Defense Network (OSDN) as a solution to the OSAD problem. The proposed network uses an encoder with feature-denoising layers coupled with a classifier to learn a noise-free latent feature representation. Two techniques are employed to obtain an informative latent feature space with the objective of improving open-set performance. First, a decoder is used to ensure that clean images can be reconstructed from the obtained latent features. Then, self-supervision is used to ensure that the latent features are informative enough to carry out an auxiliary task. We introduce a testing protocol to evaluate OSAD performance and show the effectiveness of the proposed method in multiple object classification datasets.

This paper proposes to learn a lightweight video style transfer network via knowledge distillation paradigm. We adopt two teacher networks, one of which takes optical flow during inference while the other does not. The output difference between these two teacher networks highlights the improvements made by optical flow, which is then adopted to distill the target student network. Furthermore, a low-rank distillation loss is employed to stabilize the output of student network by mimicking the rank of input videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our student network without an optical flow module is still able to generate stable video and runs much faster than the teacher network.\"",

Existing deep networks developed for point cloud data analysis are prone to overfitting and a partial change in test data leads to unpredictable behaviour of the networks. In this paper, we propose a smart yet simple deep network for analysis of 3D models using `orderly disorder' theory. Orderly disorder is a way of describing the complex structure of disorders within complex systems. Our method extracts the deep patterns inside a 3D object via creating a dynamic link to seek the most stable patterns and at once, throws away the unstable ones. Patterns are more robust to changes in data distribution, especially those that appear in the top layers. Features are extracted via an innovative cloning decomposition technique and then linked to each other to form stable complex patterns. Our model alleviates the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthens dynamic link propagation and substantially reduces the number of parameters. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmark datasets verify the superiority of our light network on the segmentation and classification tasks, especially in the presence of noise wherein our network's performance drops less than 10\\% while the state-of-the-art networks fail to work.\"",

In this work, we propose a dedicated Semantics-guided Part Attention Network (SPAN) to robustly predict part attention masks for different views of vehicles given only image-level semantic labels during training. With the help of part attention masks, we can extract discriminative features in each part separately.

        "abstract": "Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have shown dominant performance in the task of super-resolution (SR). However, their heavy memory cost and computation overhead significantly restrict their practical deployments on resource-limited devices, which mainly arise from the floating-point storage and operations between weights and activations. Although previous endeavors mainly resort to fixed-point operations, quantizing both weights and activations with fixed coding lengths may cause significant performance drop, especially on low bits. Specifically, most state-of-the-art SR models without batch normalization have a large dynamic quantization range, which also serves as another cause of performance drop. To address these two issues, we propose a new quantization scheme termed PArameterized Max Scale (PAMS), which applies the trainable truncated parameter to explore the upper bound of the quantization range adaptively. Finally, a structured knowledge transfer (SKT) loss is introduced to fine-tune the quantized network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PAMS scheme can well compress and accelerate the existing SR models such as EDSR and RDN. Notably, 8-bit PAMS-EDSR improves PSNR on Set5 benchmark from 32.095dB to 32.124dB with 2.42$ imes$ compression ratio, which achieves a new state-of-the-art.\"",

To achieve this purpose, each pixel on search feature is utilized to calculate the similarity with global template feature. This calculation method can appropriately reduce the matching area, thus introducing less background interference.

The most recent IR methods based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved significant improvement in visual performance, but also presented great challenges for quantitative evaluation. Notably, we observe an increasing inconsistency between perceptual quality and the evaluation results. Then we raise two questions: (1) Can existing IQA methods objectively evaluate recent IR algorithms? (2) When focus on beating current benchmarks, are we getting better IR algorithms? To answer these questions and promote the development of IQA methods, we contribute a large-scale IQA dataset, called Perceptual Image Processing Algorithms (PIPAL) dataset. Especially, this dataset includes the results of GAN-based methods, which are missing in previous datasets. We collect more than 1.13 million human judgments to assign subjective scores for PIPAL images using the more reliable ``Elo system''. Based on PIPAL, we present new benchmarks for both IQA and super-resolution methods. Our results indicate that existing IQA methods cannot fairly evaluate GAN-based IR algorithms. While using appropriate evaluation methods is important, IQA methods should also be updated along with the development of IR algorithms. At last, we improve the performance of IQA networks on GAN-based distortions by introducing anti-aliasing pooling. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method.\"",

Existing OBB approaches are mostly built on horizontal bounding box detectors by introducing an additional angle dimension optimized by a distance loss. However, as the distance loss only minimizes the angle error of the OBB and that it loosely correlates to the IoU, it is insensitive to objects with high aspect ratios. Therefore, a novel loss, Pixels-IoU (PIoU) Loss, is formulated to exploit both the angle and IoU for accurate OBB regression. The PIoU loss is derived from IoU metric with a pixel-wise form, which is simple and suitable for both horizontal and oriented bounding box. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluate the PIoU loss on both anchor-based and anchor-free frameworks. The experimental results show that PIoU loss can dramatically improve the performance of OBB detectors, particularly on objects with high aspect ratios and complex backgrounds. Besides, previous evaluation datasets did not include scenarios where the objects have high aspect ratios, hence a new dataset, Retail50K, is introduced to encourage the community to adapt OBB detectors for more complex environments.\"",

For enhancing the robustness of CNNs to scale variance, multi-scale feature fusion from different layers or filters attracts great attention among existing solutions, while the more granular kernel space is overlooked. We bridge this regret by exploiting multi-scale features in a finer granularity. The proposed convolution operation, named Poly-Scale Convolution (PSConv), mixes up a spectrum of dilation rates and tactfully allocates them in the individual convolutional kernels of each filter regarding a single convolutional layer. Specifically, dilation rates vary cyclically along the axes of input and output channels of the filters, aggregating features over a wide range of scales in a neat style. PSConv could be a drop-in replacement of the vanilla convolution in many prevailing CNN backbones, allowing better representation learning without introducing additional parameters and computational complexities. Comprehensive experiments on the ImageNet and MS COCO benchmarks validate the superior performance of PSConv. Code and models are available at https://github.com/d-li14/PSConv\"",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network based method, called PUGeo-Net, for upsampling 3D point clouds. PUGeo-Net incorporates discrete differential geometry into deep learning elegantly by learning the first and second fundamental forms that are able to fully represent the local geometry unique up to rigid motion. Specifically, we encode the first fundamental form in a 3 $ imes$ 3 linear transformation matrix $\\mathbf{T}$ for each input point. Such a matrix approximates the augmented Jacobian matrix of a local parameterization that encodes the intrinsic information and builds a one-to-one correspondence between the 2D parametric domain and the 3D tangent plane, so that we can lift the adaptively distributed 2D samples learned from the input to 3D space. After that, we use the learned second fundamental form to compute a normal displacement for each generated sample and project it to the curved surface. As a by-product, PUGeo-Net can compute normals for the original and generated points, which is highly desired for surface reconstruction algorithms. We evaluate PUGeo-Net on a wide range of 3D models with sharp features and rich geometric details and observe that PUGeo-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency for upsampling factor 4 - 16. We also verify the geometry-centric nature of PUGeo-Net quantitatively. In addition, PUGeo-Net can handle noisy and non-uniformly distributed inputs well, validating its robustness.

        "abstract": "State-of-the-art object detectors exploit multi-branch structure and predict objects at several different scales, although substantially boosted accuracy is acquired, low efficiency is inevitable as fragmented structure is hardware unfriendly. To solve this issue, we propose a packing operator (PackOp) to combine all head branches together at spatial. Packed features are computationally more efficient and allow to use cross-head group normalization (GN) at handy, leading to notable accuracy improvement against the common head-separate GN. All of these are only at the cost of less than 5.7% relative increase on runtime memory and introduction of a few noisy training samples, however, whose side-effects could be diminished by good packing patterns design. With PackOp, we propose a new anchor-free one-stage detector, PackDet, which features a single deeper/longer but narrower head compared to the existing methods: multiple shallow but wide heads. Our best models on COCO test-dev achieve better speed-accuracy balance: 35.1%, 42.3%, 44.0%, 47.4% AP with 22.6, 16.9, 12.4, 4.7 FPS using MobileNet-v2, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and ResNeXt-101-DCN backbone, respectively.

We study the problem of learning localization model on target classes with weakly supervised image labels, helped by a fully annotated source dataset. Typically, a WSOL model is first trained to predict class generic objectness scores on an off-the-shelf fully supervised source dataset and then it is progressively adapted to learn the objects in the weakly supervised target dataset. In this work, we argue that learning only an objectness function is a weak form of knowledge transfer and propose to learn a classwise pairwise similarity function that directly compares two input proposals as well. The combined localization model and the estimated object annotations are jointly learned in an alternating optimization paradigm as is typically done in standard WSOL methods. In contrast to the existing work that learns pairwise similarities, our approach optimizes a unified objective with convergence guarantee and it is computationally efficient for large-scale applications. Experiments on the COCO and ILSVRC 2013 detection datasets show that the performance of the localization model improves significantly with the inclusion of pairwise similarity function. For instance, in the ILSVRC dataset, the Correct Localization (CorLoc) performance improves from 72.8% to 78.2% which is a new state-of-the-art for WSOL task in the context of knowledge transfer.\"",

In addition, we propose to leverage unlabeled data to enrich our part-aware prototypes, resulting in better modeling of intra-class variations of semantic objects.

        "abstract": "This paper discusses unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) with target shift, i.e., UDA with the non-identical label distributions of the source and target domains. In practice, this is an important problem; as we do not know labels in target domain datasets, we do not know whether or not its distribution is identical to that in the source domain dataset. Despite the inaccessibility to the shape of label distribution in the target domain, a common approach of modern UDA methods reduces the gap between the feature distributions of source and target domains, which implicitly assumes that the label distributions are identical, resulting in an unsatisfactory performance upon target shift. To overcome this problem, the proposed method, partially shared variational autoencoders (PS-VAEs), uses a pair-wise feature alignment instead of feature distribution matching. PS-VAEs inter-convert domain of each sample by a CycleGAN-based architecture while preserving its label-related content by sharing weights of two domain conversion branches as much as possible. To evaluate the performance of PS-VAEs, we carried out two experiments: UDA from synthesized data to real observation in human-pose estimation (regression) and UDA under controlled target shift intensities with digits datasets (classification). The proposed method outperformed the other methods in the regression task with a large margin while presenting its robustness with various levels of target shift.\"",

PatchAttack induces misclassifications by superimposing small textured patches on the input image. We parametrize the appearance of these patches by a dictionary of class-specific textures. This texture dictionary is learned by clustering Gram matrices of feature activations from a VGG backbone. PatchAttack optimizes the position and texture parameters of each patch using reinforcement learning.

Implicit surface representations, such as signed-distance functions, allow to represent shapes of arbitrary topologies. Since a continous function is learned, the reconstructions can also be extracted at any arbitrary resolution. However, large shape datasets such as Shapenet are required to train such models. In this paper, we present a mid-level patch-based surface representation. At the level of patches, objects across different categories share similarities, which leads to more generalizable models. We introduce a novel method to learn these patches in a canonical space, such that they are as object-agnostic as possible. We show that patches trained on one category of objects from ShapeNet can also represent detailed shapes from any other category as well. In addition, our patches can be trained using much fewer shapes, compared to existing approaches. We show several applications of our new representation, including shape interpolation and partial point cloud completion. Due to explicit control over patch extrinsics, our representation is also more controllable compared to object-level representations, which we demonstrate by non-rigidly deforming shapes. \"",

Our method is based on predicting dense local shape descriptors, which we assemble to form instances. All instances are assembled simultaneously in one go. To our knowledge, our method is the first non-iterative method that yields instances that are composed of learnt shape patches. We evaluate our method on a diverse range of data domains, where it defines the new state of the art on four benchmarks, namely the ISBI 2012 EM segmentation benchmark, the BBBC010 C. elegans dataset, and 2d as well as 3d fluorescence microscopy datasets of cell nuclei. We show furthermore that our method also applies to 3d light microscopy data of drosophila neurons, which exhibit extreme cases of complex shape clusters.\"",

Their intrinsic problem is that they directly localize the joints based on visual information; however, the invisible joints are lack of that. In contrast to localization, our framework estimates the invisible joints from an inference perspective by proposing an Image-Guided Progressive GCN module which provides a comprehensive understanding of both image context and pose structure. Moreover, existing benchmarks contain limited occlusions for evaluation. Therefore, we thoroughly pursue this problem and propose a novel OPEC-Net framework together with a new Occluded Pose (OCPose) dataset with 9k annotated images. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on benchmarks demonstrate that OPEC-Net achieves significant improvements over recent leading works. Notably, our OCPose is the most complex occlusion dataset with respect to average IoU between adjacent instances. Source code and OCPose will be publicly available.\"",

Our key insight is that considering humans and objects jointly gives rise to ``3D common sense\"\" constraints that can be used to resolve ambiguity. In particular, we introduce a scale loss that learns the distribution of object size from data; an occlusion-aware silhouette re-projection loss to optimize object pose; and a human-object interaction loss to capture the spatial layout of objects with which humans interact. We empirically validate that our constraints dramatically reduce the space of likely 3D spatial configurations. We demonstrate our approach on challenging, in-the-wild images of humans interacting with large objects (such as bicycles, motorcycles, and surfboards) and handheld objects (such as laptops, tennis rackets, and skateboards). We quantify the ability of our approach to recover human-object arrangements and outline remaining challenges in this relatively unexplored domain.

Use of deformation transfer or multilinear tensor as a personalized 3DMM for blendshape interpolation does not address the fact that facial expressions result in different local and global skin deformations in different persons. Moreover, existing methods learn a single albedo per user which is not enough to capture the expression-specific skin reflectance variations. We propose an end-to-end framework that jointly learns a personalized face model per user and per-frame facial motion parameters from a large corpus of in-the-wild videos of user expressions. Specifically, we learn user-specific expression blendshapes and dynamic (expression-specific) albedo maps by predicting personalized corrections on top of a 3DMM prior. We introduce novel training constraints to ensure that the corrected blendshapes retain their semantic meanings and the reconstructed geometry is disentangled from the albedo. Experimental results show that our personalization accurately captures fine-grained facial dynamics in a wide range of conditions and efficiently decouples the learned face model from facial motion, resulting in more accurate face reconstruction and facial motion retargeting compared to state-of-the-art methods.\"",

In practice, however, measurements of low photon counts are often mixed with heavy background noise, which poses a great challenge for existing computational reconstruction algorithms. In this paper, we first analyze the long-range correlations in both spatial and temporal dimensions of the measurements. Then we propose a non-local neural network for depth reconstruction by exploiting the long-range correlations. The proposed network achieves decent reconstruction fidelity even under photon counts (and signal-to-background ratio, SBR) as low as 1 photon/pixel (and 0.01 SBR), which significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art. Moreover, our non-local network trained on simulated data can be well generalized to different real-world imaging systems, which could extend the application scope of photon-efficient imaging in challenging scenarios with a strict limit on optical flux.

        "abstract": "Existing interactive object segmentation methods mainly take spatial interactions such as bounding boxes or clicks as input. However, these interactions do not contain information about explicit attributes of the target-of-interest and thus cannot quickly specify what the selected object exactly is, especially when there are diverse scales of candidate objects or the target-of-interest contains multiple objects. Therefore, excessive user interactions are often required to reach desirable results. On the other hand, in existing approaches attribute information of objects is often not well utilized in interactive segmentation. We propose to employ phrase expressions as another interaction input to infer the attributes of target object. In this way, we can 1) leverage spatial clicks to locate the target object and 2) utilize semantic phrases to qualify the attributes of the target object. Specifically, the phrase expressions focus on ``what\"\" the target object is and the spatial clicks are in charge of ``where\"\" the target object is, which together help to accurately segment the target-of-interest with smaller number of interactions. Moreover, the proposed approach is flexible in terms of interaction modes and can efficiently handle complex scenarios by leveraging the strengths of each type of input. Our multi-modal phrase+click approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance on interactive segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage both clicks and phrases for interactive segmentation.\"",

Modern deep neural networks, on the other hand, are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting: when adapted to perform new tasks, they often fail to preserve their performance on previously learned tasks. Given a sequence of tasks, a naive approach addressing catastrophic forgetting is to train a separate standalone model for each task, which scales the total number of parameters drastically without efficiently utilizing previous models. In contrast, we propose a parameter efficient framework, Piggyback GAN, which learns the current task by building a set of convolutional and deconvolutional filters that are factorized into filters of the models trained on previous tasks. For the current task, our model achieves high generation quality on par with a standalone model at a lower number of parameters. For previous tasks, our model can also preserve generation quality since the filters for previous tasks are not altered. We validate Piggyback GAN on various image-conditioned generation tasks across different domains, and provide qualitative and quantitative results to show that the proposed approach can address catastrophic forgetting effectively and efficiently.\"",

        "abstract": "We present a simple and flexible object detection framework optimized for autonomous driving. Building on the observation that point clouds in this application are extremely sparse, we propose a practical pillar-based approach to fix the imbalance issue caused by anchors. In particular, our algorithm incorporates a cylindrical projection into multi-view feature learning, predicts bounding box parameters per pillar rather than per point or per anchor, and includes an aligned pillar-to-point projection module to improve the final prediction. Our anchor-free approach avoids hyperparameter search associated with past methods, simplifying 3D object detection while significantly improving upon state-of-the-art. \"",

We address these issues by designing neural networks capable of generating high-quality parametric 3D surfaces which are also consistent between views. Furthermore, the generated 3D surfaces preserve accurate image pixel to 3D surface point correspondences, allowing us to lift texture information to reconstruct shapes with rich geometry and appearance.

While place recognition has been widely studied in previous work, there remains a long way towards comprehensive place understanding, which is far beyond categorizing a place with an image and requires information of multiple aspects. In this work, we contribute Placepedia1, a large-scale place dataset with more than 35M photos from 240K unique places. Besides the photos, each place also comes with massive multi-faceted information, e.g. GDP, population, etc., and labels at multiple levels, including function, city, country, etc.. This dataset, with its large amount of data and rich annotations, allows various studies to be conducted. Particularly, in our studies, we develop 1) PlaceNet, a unied framework for multi-level place recognition, and 2) a method for city embedding, which can produce a vector representation for a city that captures both visual and multi-faceted side information. Such studies not only reveal key challenges in place understanding, but also establish connections between visual observations and underlying socioeconomic/cultural implications.\"",

While this center-point regression is simple and efficient, we argue that the image features extracted at a central point contain limited information for predicting distant keypoints or bounding box boundaries, due to object deformation and scale/orientation variation. To facilitate inference, we propose to instead perform regression from a set of points placed at more advantageous positions. This point set is arranged to reflect a good initialization for the given task, such as modes in the training data for pose estimation, which lie closer to the ground truth than the central point and provide more informative features for regression. As the utility of a point set depends on how well its scale, aspect ratio and rotation matches the target, we adopt the anchor box technique of sampling these transformations to generate additional point-set candidates. We apply this proposed framework, called Point-Set Anchors, to object detection, instance segmentation, and human pose estimation. Our results show that this general-purpose approach can achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods for each of these tasks.\"",

This estimated spherical harmonics coefficients can be directly utilized by rendering engines for supporting spatially variant indoor lighting, in the context of augmented reality. Our key insight is to formulate the lighting estimation as a point cloud-based learning problem directly from point clouds, which is in part inspired by the Monte Carlo integration leveraged by real-time spherical harmonics lighting. While existing approaches estimate lighting information with complex deep learning pipelines, our method focuses on reducing the computational complexity. Through both quantitative and qualitative experiments, we demonstrate that PointAR achieves lower lighting estimation errors compared to state-of-the-art methods. Further, our method requires an order of magnitude lower resource, comparable to that of mobile-specific DNNs.\"",

The finding that pre-training a network on a rich source set (g, ImageNet) can help boost performance once fine-tuned on a usually much smaller target set, has been instrumental to many applications in language and vision. Yet, very little is known about its usefulness in 3D point cloud understanding. We see this as an opportunity considering the effort required for annotating data in 3D. In this work, we aim at facilitating research on 3D representation learning. Different from previous works, we focus on high-level scene understanding tasks. To this end, we select a suit of diverse datasets and tasks to measure the effect of unsupervised pre-training on a large source set of 3D scenes. Our findings are extremely encouraging: using a unified triplet of architecture, source dataset, and contrastive loss for pre-training, we achieve improvement over recent best results in segmentation and detection across 6 different benchmarks for indoor and outdoor, real and synthetic datasets -- demonstrating that the learned representation can generalize across domains. Furthermore, the improvement was similar to supervised pre-training, suggesting that future efforts should favor scaling data collection over more detailed annotation. We hope these findings will encourage more research on unsupervised pretext task design for 3D deep learning.\"",

In this paper, we define data augmentation between point clouds as a shortest path linear interpolation. To that end, we introduce PointMixup, an interpolation method that generates new examples through an optimal assignment of the path function between two point clouds. We prove that our PointMixup finds the shortest path between two point clouds and that the interpolation is assignment invariant and linear. With the definition of interpolation, PointMixup allows to introduce strong interpolation-based regularizers such as mixup and manifold mixup to the point cloud domain. Experimentally, we show the potential of PointMixup for point cloud classification, especially when examples are scarce, as well as increased robustness to noise and geometric transformations to points. The code for PointMixup and the experimental details are publicly available.\"",

Classical methods (e.g. Poisson reconstruction) start to degrade in the presence of noisy and partial scans.

However, such data-driven methods struggle to generalize to new shapes with large geometric and topological variations. We present Points2Surf, a novel patch-based learning framework that produces accurate surfaces directly from raw scans without normals. Learning a prior over a combination of detailed local patches and coarse global information improves generalization performance and reconstruction accuracy. Our extensive comparison on both synthetic and real data demonstrates a clear advantage of our method over state-of-the-art alternatives on previously unseen classes (on average, Points2Surf brings down reconstruction error by 30% over SPR and by 270%+ over deep learning based SotA methods) at the cost of longer computation times and a slight increase in small-scale topological noise in some cases.

In this paper, we propose a novel 3D reconstruction method called Polarimetric Multi-View Inverse Rendering (Polarimetric MVIR) that effectively exploits geometric, photometric, and polarimetric cues extracted from input multi-view color polarization images. We first estimate camera poses and an initial 3D model by geometric reconstruction with a standard structure-from-motion and multi-view stereo pipeline. We then refine the initial model by optimizing photometric and polarimetric rendering errors using multi-view RGB and AoP images, where we propose a novel polarimetric rendering cost function that enables us to effectively constrain each estimated surface vertex's normal while considering four possible ambiguous azimuth angles revealed from the AoP measurement. Experimental results using both synthetic and real data demonstrate that our Polarimetric MVIR can reconstruct a detailed 3D shape without assuming a specific polarized reflection depending on the material.\"",

        "abstract": "We merge by generalization two principles of passive optical sensing of motion. One is common spatially resolved imaging, where motion induces temporal readout changes at high-contrast spatial features, as used in traditional optical-flow. The other is the polarization compass, where axial rotation induces temporal readout changes due to the change of incoming polarization angle, relative to the camera frame. The latter has traditionally been modeled for uniform objects. This merger generalizes the brightness constancy assumption and optical-flow, to handle polarization. It also generalizes the polarization compass concept to handle arbitrarily textured objects. This way, scene regions having partial polarization contribute to motion estimation, irrespective of their texture and non-uniformity. As an application, we derive and demonstrate passive sensing of differential ego-rotation around the camera optical axis. \"",

Most of previous methods utilize semantic segmentation to identify the regions of traffic lanes in an image, and then adopt some curve-fitting method to reconstruct the lanes. In this work, we propose to use polynomial curves to represent traffic lanes and then propose a novel polynomial regression network (PRNet) to directly predict them, where semantic segmentation is not involved. Specifically, PRNet consists of one major branch and two auxiliary branches: (1) polynomial regression to estimate the polynomial coefficients of lanes, (2) initialization classification to detect the initial retrieval point of each lane, and (3) height regression to determine the ending point of each lane. Through the cooperation of three branches, PRNet can detect variable-number of lanes and is highly effective and efficient. We experimentally evaluate the proposed PRNet on two popular benchmark datasets: TuSimple and CULane. The results show that our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and speed. \"",

        "abstract": "Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is important in human-centric scene understanding. Existing works typically assume that the same verb in different HOI categories has similar visual characteristics, while ignoring the diverse semantic meanings of the verb. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel Polysemy Deciphering Network (PD-Net), which decodes the visual polysemy of verbs for HOI detection in three ways. First, PD-Net augments human pose and spatial features for HOI detection using language priors, enabling the verb classifiers to receive language hints that reduce the intra-class variation of the same verb. Second, we introduce a novel Polysemy Attention Module (PAM) that guides PD-Net to make decisions based on more important feature types according to the language priors. Finally, the above two strategies are applied to two types of classifiers for verb recognition, i.e., object-shared and object-specific verb classifiers, whose combination further relieves the verb polysemy problem. By deciphering the visual polysemy of verbs, we achieve the best performance on both HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets. In particular, PD-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 3.81% mAP in the Known-Object evaluation mode of HICO-DET. Code of PD-Net will be released at https://github.com/MuchHair/PD-Net.\"",

        "abstract": "Object pose increases interclass object variance which makes object recognition from 2D images harder. To render a classifier robust to pose variations, most deep neural networks try to eliminate the influence of pose by using large datasets with many poses for each class. Here, we propose a different approach: a class-agnostic object pose transformation network (OPT-Net) can transform an image along 3D yaw and pitch axes to synthesize additional poses continuously. Synthesized images lead to better training of an object classifier. We design a novel eliminate-add structure to explicitly disentangle pose from object identity: first \u2018eliminate\u2019 pose information of the input image and then \u2018add\u2019 target pose information (regularized as continuous variables) to synthesize any target pose. We trained OPT-Net on images of toy vehicles shot on a turntable from the iLab-20M dataset. After training on unbalanced discrete poses (5 classes with 6 poses per object instance, plus 5 classes with only 2 poses), we show that OPT-Net can synthesize balanced continuous new poses along yaw and pitch axes with high quality. Training a ResNet-18 classifier with original plus synthesized poses improves mAP accuracy by 9% over training on original poses only. Further, the pre-trained OPT-Net can generalize to new object classes, which we demonstrate on both iLab-20M and RGB-D. We also show that the learned features can generalize to ImageNet.

The first weakness of these methods is the overfitting to image appearance, due to the domain gap between the training data captured from controlled settings such as a lab, and in-the-wild data in inference time. The second weakness is that the estimation of the pose parameters is quite challenging due to the representation issues of 3D rotations. To overcome the above weaknesses, we propose Pose2Mesh, a novel graph convolutional neural network (GraphCNN)-based system that estimates the 3D coordinates of human {m mesh vertices} directly from the {m 2D human pose}. The 2D human pose as an input provides essential human body articulation information without image appearance. Also, the proposed system avoids the representation issues, while fully exploiting the mesh topology using GraphCNN in a coarse-to-fine manner. We show that our Pose2Mesh significantly outperforms the previous 3D human pose and mesh estimation methods on various benchmark datasets.

Post-training quantization is highly desirable since it does not require retraining or access to the full training dataset. The well-established uniform scheme for post-training quantization achieves satisfactory results by converting DNNs from full-precision to 8-bit fixed-point integers. However, it suffers from significant performance degradation when quantizing to lower bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a PieceWise Linear Quantization (PWLQ) scheme to enable accurate approximation for tensor values that have bell-shaped distributions with long tails. Our approach breaks the entire quantization range into non-overlapping regions for each tensor, with each region being assigned an equal number of quantization levels. Optimal breakpoints that divide the entire range are found by minimizing the quantization error. Compared to state-of-the-art post-training quantization methods, experimental results show that our proposed method achieves superior performance on image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection with minor overhead. \"",

In this paper, we study the problem of the Trojan network (TrojanNet) detection in the data-scarce regime, where only the weights of a trained DNN are accessed by the detector. We first propose a data-limited TrojanNet detector (TND), when only a few data samples are available for TrojanNet detection. We show that an effective data-limited TND can be established by exploring connections between Trojan attack and prediction-evasion adversarial attacks including per-sample attack as well as all-sample universal attack. In addition, we propose a data-free TND, which can detect a TrojanNet without accessing any data samples. We show that such a TND can be built by leveraging the internal response of hidden neurons, which exhibits the Trojan behavior even at random noise inputs. The effectiveness of our proposals is evaluated by extensive experiments under different model architectures and datasets including CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and ImageNet.\"",

This paper presents a new, practical targeted poisoning attack method on neural networks in vision domain, namely BlackCard. BlackCard possesses a set of critical properties for ensuring attacking efficacy in practice, which has never been simultaneously achieved by any existing work, including knowledge-oblivious, clean-label, and clean-test. Importantly, we show that the effectiveness of BlackCard can be intuitively guaranteed by a set of analytical reasoning and observations, through exploiting an essential characteristic of gradient-descent optimization which is pervasively adopted in DNN models. We evaluate the efficacy of BlackCard for generating targeted poisoning attacks via extensive experiments using various datasets and DNN models. Results show that BlackCard is effective with a rather high success rate while preserving all the claimed properties.\"",

        "abstract": "Low-resolution person re-identification (LR re-id) is a challenging task with low-resolution probes and high-resolution gallery images. To address the resolution mismatch, existing methods typically recover missing details for low-resolution probes by super-resolution. However, they usually pre-specify fixed scale factors for all images, and ignore the fact that choosing a preferable scale factor for certain image content probably greatly benefits the identification. In this paper, we propose a novel Prediction, Recovery and Identification (PRI) model for LR re-id, which adaptively recovers missing details by predicting a preferable scale factor based on the image content. To deal with the lack of ground-truth optimal scale factors, our model contains a self-supervised scale factor metric that automatically generates dynamic soft labels. The generated labels indicate probabilities that each scale factor is optimal, which are used as guidance to enhance the content-aware scale factor prediction. Consequently, our model can more accurately predict and recover the content-aware details, and achieve state-of-the-art performances on four LR re-id datasets.\"",

Popular approaches rely on a variety of metric learning losses, which prescribe what the proximity of image and text should be, in the learned space. However, most prior methods have focused on the case where image and text convey redundant information; in contrast, real-world image-text pairs convey complementary information with little overlap. Further, images in news articles and media portray topics in a visually diverse fashion; thus, we need to take special care to ensure a meaningful image representation. We propose novel within-modality losses which encourage semantic coherency in both the text and image subspaces, which does not necessarily align with visual coherency. Our method ensures that not only are paired images and texts close, but the expected image-image and text-text relationships are also observed. Our approach improves the results of cross-modal retrieval on four datasets compared to five baselines.\"",

Furthermore, we propose Prime-Aware Adaptive Distillation (PAD) by the incorporation of uncertainty learning. PAD perceives the prime samples in distillation and then emphasizes their effect adaptively. PAD is fundamentally different from and would refine existing methods with the innovative view of unequal training. For this reason, PAD is versatile and has been applied in various tasks including classification, metric learning, and object detection.

To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised prior-based domain adversarial object detection framework for adapting the detectors to hazy and rainy conditions. In particular, we use weather-specific prior knowledge obtained using the principles of image formation to define a novel prior-adversarial loss. The prior-adversarial loss, which we use to supervise the adaptation process, aims to reduce the weather-specific information in the features, thereby mitigating the effects of weather on the detection performance. Additionally, we introduce a set of residual feature recovery blocks in the object detection pipeline to de-distort the feature space, resulting in further improvements. Evaluations performed on various datasets (Foggy-Cityscapes, Rainy-Cityscapes, RTTS and UFDD) for rainy and hazy conditions demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\"",

The recent trend towards cloud-based localization and mapping systems has raised significant privacy concerns. These are mainly grounded by the fact that these services require users to upload visual data to their servers, which can reveal potentially confidential information, even if only derived image features are uploaded. Recent research addresses some of these concerns for the task of image-based localization by concealing the geometry of the query images and database maps. The core idea of the approach is to lift 2D/3D feature points to random lines, while still providing sufficient constraints for camera pose estimation. In this paper, we further build upon this idea and propose solutions to the different core algorithms of an incremental Structure-from-Motion pipeline based on random line features. With this work, we make another fundamental step towards enabling privacy preserving cloud-based mapping solutions. Various experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate the practicality of our approach achieving comparable results to standard Structure-from-Motion systems.\"",

Previous studies have proposed localization methods to estimate a camera pose using a line-cloud map for a single image or a reconstructed point cloud. These methods offer a scene privacy protection against the inversion attacks by converting a point cloud to a line cloud, which reconstruct the scene images from the point cloud. However, they are not directly applicable to a video sequence because they do not address computational efficiency. This is a critical issue to solve for estimating camera poses and performing bundle adjustment with mixed line and point clouds in real time. Moreover, there has been no study on a method to optimize a line-cloud map of a server with a point cloud reconstructed from a client video because any observation points on the image coordinates are not available to prevent the inversion attacks, namely the reversibility of the 3D lines. The experimental results with synthetic and real data show that our Visual SLAM framework achieves the intended privacy-preserving formation and real-time performance using a line-cloud map.\"",

In this paper we propose a novel anchor assignment strategy that adaptively separates anchors into positive and negative samples for a ground truth bounding box according to the model's learning status such that it is able to reason the separation in a probabilistic manner. To do so we first calculate the score of anchors conditioned on the model's learning status and fit these scores to a probability distribution. The model is then trained with anchors separated into positive and negative samples according to their probabilities. Moreover, We investigate the gap between objectives of training and testing and propose to predict Intersection-over-Unions of detected boxes as a measure of the localization quality to reduce the discrepancy. The combined score of classification and localization qualities serving as a box selection metric in non-maximum suppression well aligns with the proposed anchor assignment strategy and leads significant performance improvements. The proposed methods only add a single convolutional layer to RetinaNet baseline and does not require multiple anchors per location, so are efficient. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Especially, our models set new records for single-stage detectors on MS COCO test-dev dataset for various backbones.\"",

Recently, there have been some approaches that incorporate the problem setting of non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM) into deep learning to learn 3D structure reconstruction. The most important difficulty of NRSfM is to estimate both the rotation and deformation at the same time, and previous works handle this by regressing both of them. In this paper, we resolve this difficulty by proposing a loss function wherein the suitable rotation is automatically determined. Trained with the cost function consisting of the reprojection error and the low-rank term of aligned shapes, the network learns the 3D structures of such objects as human skeletons and faces during the training, whereas the testing is done in a single-frame basis. The proposed method can handle inputs with missing entries and experimental results validate that the proposed framework shows superior reconstruction performance to the state-of-the-art method on the Human 3.6M, 300-VW, and SURREAL dataset, even though the underlying network structure is very simple.\"",

Recent attempts have been made to cope with this issue by incorporating image / feature pyramids or adjusting anchor sampling / matching strategies. In this work, we propose a novel scale-aware progressive training mechanism to address large scale variations across faces. Inspired by curriculum learning, our method gradually learns large-to-small face instances. The preceding models learned with easier samples (i.e., large faces) can provide good initialization for succeeding learning with harder samples (i.e., small faces), ultimately deriving a better optimum of face detectors. Moreover, we propose an auxiliary anchor-free enhancement module to facilitate the learning of small faces by supplying positive anchors that may be not covered according to the criterion of IoU overlap. Such anchor-free module will be removed during inference and hence no extra computation cost is introduced. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to the state-of-the-arts on the standard FDDB and WIDER FACE benchmarks. Especially, our ProgressFace-Light with MobileNet-0.25 backbone achieves 87.9% AP on the hard set of WIDER FACE, surpassing largely RetinaFace with the same backbone by 9.7%.

By concatenating different resolutions of local and global feature maps, we employ the multi-layer perceptron as the generation network to generate multi-resolution point clouds. In order to keep the shapes of different resolutions of point clouds consistent, we propose a shape-preserving adversarial loss to train the point cloud deconvolution generation network. Experimental results on ShpaeNet and ModelNet datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can yield good performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/fpthink/PDGN.\"",

        "abstract": "We present Progressive Refinement Network (PRNet), a novel single-stage detector that tackles occluded pedestrian detection. Motivated by human's progressive process on annotating occluded pedestrians, PRNet achieves sequential refinement by three phases: Finding high-confident anchors of visible parts, calibrating such anchors to a full-body template derived from occlusion statistics, and then adjusting the calibrated anchors to final full-body regions. Unlike conventional methods that exploit predefined anchors, the confidence-aware calibration offers adaptive anchor initialization for detection with occlusions, and helps reduce the gap between visible-part and full-body detection. In addition, we introduce an occlusion loss to up-weigh hard examples, and a Receptive Field Backfeed (RFB) module to diversify receptive fields in early layers that commonly fire only on visible parts or small-size full-body regions. Experiments were performed within and across CityPersons, ETH, and Caltech datasets. Results show that PRNet can match the speed of existing single-stage detectors, consistently outperforms alternatives in terms of overall miss rate, and offers significantly better cross-dataset generalization.

Starting from a coarse initial prediction by a multi-scale residual block, we propose a progressively guided alternate refinement network to refine it. Instead of using ImageNet pre-trained backbone network, we first construct a lightweight depth stream by learning from scratch, which can extract complementary features more efficiently with less redundancy. Then, different from the existing fusion based methods, RGB and depth features are fed into proposed guided residual (GR) blocks alternately to reduce their mutual degradation. By assigning progressive guidance in the stacked GR blocks within each side-output, the false detection and missing parts can be well remedied. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin, and also shows superiority in efficiency (71 FPS) and model size (64.9 MB).\"",

Specifically, we first construct a linguistic graph parsed from the sentence and then capture multimodal feature maps for all the phrasal nodes independently.

Early approaches follow image inpainting paradigms, but are challenged by complex camera motion and non-rigid deformations. To address these challenges flow-guided propagation techniques have been proposed. However, computation of flow is non-trivial for unobserved regions and propagation across a whole video sequence is computationally demanding. In contrast, in this paper, we propose a video inpainting algorithm based on proposals: we use 3D convolutions to obtain an initial inpainting estimate which is subsequently refined by fusing a generated set of proposals. Different from existing approaches for video inpainting, and inspired by well-explored mechanisms for object detection, we argue that proposals provide a rich source of information that permits to combine similarly looking patches that may be spatially and temporally far from the region to be inpainted. We validate the effectiveness of our method on the challenging YouTube VOS and DAVIS datasets using different settings and demonstrate results outperforming state-of-the-art on standard metrics.\"",

Estimated by an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, PMMs incorporate rich channel-wised and spatial semantics from limited support images. Utilized as representations as well as classifiers, PMMs fully leverage the semantics to activate objects in the query image while depressing background regions in a duplex manner. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and MS-COCO datasets show that PMMs significantly improve upon state-of-the-arts.

In this paper, by introducing an appropriate proxy matrix, we reduce the weights quantization error while circumventing explicit binary regularizations on the full-precision auxiliary variables. Specifically, we regard pre-binarization weights as a linear combination of the basis vectors. The matrix composed of basis vectors is referred to as the proxy matrix, and auxiliary variables serve as the coefficients of this linear combination. We are the first to empirically identify and study the effectiveness of learning both basis and coefficients to construct the pre-binarization weights.

The task is extremely challenging because of the vast areas of non-texture regions in these scenes. These areas could overwhelm the optimization process in the commonly used unsupervised depth estimation framework proposed for outdoor environments. However, even when those regions are masked out, the performance is still unsatisfactory. In this paper, we argue that the poor performance suffers from the non-discriminative point-based matching. To this end, we propose P$^2$Net. We first extract points with large local gradients and adopt patches centered at each point as its representation. Multiview consistency loss is then defined over patches. This operation significantly improves the robustness of the network training. Furthermore, because those textureless regions in indoor scenes (g, wall, floor, roof, tc) usually correspond to planar regions, we propose to leverage superpixels as a plane prior. We enforce the predicted depth to be well fitted by a plane within each superpixel. Extensive experiments on NYUv2 and ScanNet show that our P$^2$Net outperforms existing approaches by a large margin.\"",

Most of the existing knowledge distillation methods direct the student to follow the teacher by matching the teacher's output, feature maps or their distribution. In this work, we propose a novel way to achieve this goal: by distilling the knowledge through a quantized visual words space. According to our method, the teacher's feature maps are first quantized to represent the main visual concepts (i.e., visual words) encompassed in these maps and then the student is asked to predict those visual word representations. Despite its simplicity, we show that our approach is able to yield results that improve the state of the art on knowledge distillation for model compression and transfer learning scenarios. To that end, we provide an extensive evaluation across several network architectures and most commonly used benchmark datasets.\"",

However, this greedy algorithm may not work well for object detection under occlusion scenario where true positives with lower detection scores are possibly suppressed. In this paper, we first map the task of removing redundant detections into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) framework that consists of detection score from each bounding box and overlap ratio between pair of bounding boxes. Next, we solve the QUBO problem using the proposed Quantum-soft QUBO Suppression algorithm for fast and accurate detection by exploiting quantum computing advantages. Experiments indicate that our method improves mAP from 74.20 to 75.11 for PASCAL VOC2007.

Further, we theoretically connect dynamic routing between capsules to the well-known Weiszfeld algorithm, a scheme for solving iterative re-weighted least squares (IRLS) problems with provable convergence properties. It is shown that such group dynamic routing can be interpreted as robust IRLS rotation averaging on capsule votes, where information is routed based on the final inlier scores. Based on our operator, we build a capsule network that disentangles geometry from pose, paving the way for more informative descriptors and a structured latent space.

Our main insight is that parametric and non-parametric alignment methods have complementary strengths. We propose a two-stage process: first, a feature-based parametric coarse alignment using one or more homographies, followed by non-parametric fine pixel-wise alignment. Coarse alignment is performed using RANSAC on off-the-shelf deep features. Fine alignment is learned in an unsupervised way by a deep network which optimizes a standard structural similarity metric (SSIM) between the two images, plus cycle-consistency. Despite its simplicity, our method shows competitive results on a range of tasks and datasets, including unsupervised optical flow on KITTI, dense correspondences on Hpatches, two-view geometry estimation on YFCC100M, localization on Aachen Day-Night, and, for the first time, fine alignment of artworks on the Brughel dataset.

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable successes in learning feature representations for visual classification. However, deep features learned by the softmax cross-entropy loss generally show excessive intra-class variations. We argue that, because the traditional softmax losses aim to optimize only the relative differences between intra-class and inter-class distances (logits), it cannot obtain representative class prototypes (class weights/centers) to regularize intra-class distances, even when the training is converged. Previous efforts mitigate this problem by introducing auxiliary regularization losses. But these modified losses mainly focus on optimizing intra-class compactness, while ignoring keeping reasonable relations between different class prototypes. These lead to weak models and eventually limit their performance. To address this problem, this paper introduces a novel Radial Basis Function (RBF) distances to replace the commonly used inner products in the softmax loss function, such that it can adaptively assign losses to regularize the intra-class and inter-class distances by reshaping the relative differences, and thus creating more representative prototypes of classes to improve optimization. The proposed RBF-Softmax loss function not only effectively reduces intra-class distances, stabilizes the training behavior, and reserves ideal relations between prototypes, but also significantly improves the testing performance. Experiments on visual recognition benchmarks including MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet demonstrate that the proposed RBF-Softmax achieves better results than cross-entropy and other state-of-the-art classification losses.

Compared with English character or general artistic style transfer, Chinese character style transfer remains a challenge owing to the large size of the vocabulary(70224 characters in GB18010-2005) and the complexity of the structure. Recently some GAN-based methods were proposed for style transfer; however, they treated Chinese characters as a whole, ignoring the structures and radicals that compose characters. In this paper, a novel radical decomposition-and-rendering-based GAN(RD-GAN) is proposed to utilize the radical-level compositions of Chinese characters and achieves few-shot/zero-shot Chinese character style transfer. The RD-GAN consists of three components: a radical extraction module (REM), radical rendering module (RRM), and multi-level discriminator (MLD). Experiments demonstrate that our method has a powerful few-shot/zero-shot generalization ability by using the radical-level compositions of Chinese characters.\"",

The proposed network mainly solves two challenging issues: 1) how to effectively integrate the complementary information from RGB image and its corresponding depth map, and 2) how to adaptively select more saliency-related features. First, we propose a cross-modality feature modulation (cmFM) module to enhance feature representations by taking the depth features as prior, which models the complementary relations of RGB-D data. Second, we propose an adaptive feature selection (AFS) module to select saliency-related features and suppress the inferior ones. The AFS module exploits multi-modality spatial feature fusion with the self-modality and cross-modality interdependencies of channel features are considered. Third, we employ a saliency-guided position-edge attention (sg-PEA) module to encourage our network to focus more on saliency-related regions. The above modules as a whole, called cmMS block, facilitates the refinement of saliency features in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Coupled with a bottom-up inference, the refined saliency features enable accurate and edge-preserving SOD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network outperforms state-of-the-art saliency detectors on six popular RGB-D SOD benchmarks.\"",

        "abstract": "In this work, we propose an efficient and accurate monocular 3D detection framework in single shot. Most successful 3D detectors take the projection constraint from the 3D bounding box to the 2D box as an important component. Four edges of a 2D box provide only four constraints and the performance deteriorates dramatically with the small error of the 2D detector. Different from these approaches, our method predicts the nine perspective keypoints of a 3D bounding box in image space, and then utilize the geometric relationship of 3D and 2D perspectives to recover the dimension, location, and orientation in 3D space. In this method, the properties of the object can be predicted stably even when the estimation of keypoints is very noisy, which enables us to obtain fast detection speed with a small architecture. Training our method only uses the 3D properties of the object without any extra annotations, category-specific 3D shape priors, or depth maps. Our method is the first real-time system (FPS>24) for monocular image 3D detection while achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark.\"",

The main challenges of using Radar are the noise and measurement ambiguities which have been a struggle for existing simple input or output fusion methods. To better address this, we propose a new solution that exploits both LiDAR and Radar sensors for perception. Our approach, dubbed RadarNet, features a voxel-based early fusion and an attention-based late fusion, which learn from data to exploit both geometric and dynamic information of Radar data. RadarNet achieves state-of-the-art results on two large-scale real-world datasets in the tasks of object detection and velocity estimation. We further show that exploiting Radar improves the perception capabilities of detecting faraway objects and understanding the motion of dynamic objects.\"",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose several ideas for enhancing a bi- nary network to close its accuracy gap from real-valued networks without incurring any additional computational cost. We first construct a base- line network by modifying and binarizing a compact real-valued network with parameter-free shortcuts, bypassing all the intermediate convolu- tional layers including the downsampling layers. This baseline network strikes a good trade-o\u21b5 between accuracy and e ciency, achieving su- perior performance than most of existing binary networks at approxi- mately half of the computational cost. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we observed that the performance of binary networks is sensitive to activation distribution variations. Based on this important observation, we propose to generalize the traditional Sign and PReLU functions, denoted as RSign and RPReLU for the respective general- ized functions, to enable explicit learning of the distribution reshape and shift at near-zero extra cost. Lastly, we adopt a distributional loss to further enforce the binary network to learn similar output distribu- tions as those of a real-valued network. We show that after incorporating all these ideas, the proposed ReActNet outperforms all the state-of-the- arts by a large margin. Specifically, it outperforms Real-to-Binary Net and MeliusNet29 by 4.0% and 3.6% respectively for the top-1 accuracy and also reduces the gap to its real-valued counterpart to within 3.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet dataset.

Although the conditional image generation techniques have led to large improvements in this task, there has been little effort in providing conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) with an explicit way of understanding the image noise for object-independent denoising reliable for real-world applications. The task of leveraging structures in the target space is unstable due to the complexity of patterns in natural scenes, so the presence of unnatural artifacts or over-smoothed image areas cannot be avoided. To fill the gap, in this work we introduce the idea of a cGAN which explicitly leverages structure in the image noise variance space. By learning directly a low dimensional manifold of the image noise variance, the generator promotes the removal from the noisy image only that information which spans this manifold. This idea brings many advantages while it can be appended at the end of any denoiser to significantly improve its performance. Based on our experiments, our model substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art architectures, resulting in denoised images with less oversmoothing and better detail.\"",

        "abstract": "Inspired by the success of the CNN-RNN framework in the image captioning task, several works have explored this in multi-label image annotation with the hope that the RNN followed by a CNN would encode inter-label dependencies better than using a CNN alone. To do so, for each training sample, the earlier methods converted the ground-truth label-set into a sequence of labels based on their frequencies (e.g., rare-to-frequent) for training the RNN. However, since the ground-truth is an unordered set of labels, imposing a fixed and predefined sequence on them does not naturally align with this task. To address this, some of the recent papers have proposed techniques that are capable to train the RNN without feeding the ground-truth labels in a particular sequence/order. However, most of these techniques leave it to the RNN to implicitly choose one sequence for the ground-truth labels corresponding to each sample at the time of training, thus making it inherently biased. In this paper, we address this limitation and propose a novel approach in which the RNN is explicitly forced to learn multiple relevant inter-label dependencies, without the need of feeding the ground-truth in any particular order. Using thorough empirical comparisons, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques on two popular datasets (MS-COCO and NUS-WIDE). Additionally, it provides a new perspecitve of looking at an unordered set of labels as equivalent to a collection of different permutations (sequences) of those labels, thus naturally aligning with the image annotation task.

VGQE utilizes both visual and language modalities equally while encoding the question. Hence the question representation itself gets sufficient visual-grounding, and thus reduces the dependency of the model on the language priors. We demonstrate the effect of VGQE on three recent VQA models and achieve state-of-the-art results on the bias-sensitive split of the VQAv2 dataset; VQA-CPv2. Further, unlike the existing bias-reduction techniques, on the standard VQAv2 benchmark, our approach does not drop the accuracy; instead, it improves the performance. \"",

We focus on a challenging setup where the referred object belongs to a extit{fine-grained} object class and the underlying scene contains extit{multiple} object instances of that class. Due to the scarcity and unsuitability of existent 3D-oriented linguistic resources for this task, we first develop two large-scale and complementary visio-linguistic datasets: i) extbf{ extit{Sr3D}}, which contains 83.5K template-based utterances leveraging extit{spatial relations} with other fine-grained object classes to localize a referred object in a given scene, and ii) extbf{ extit{Nr3D}} which contains 41.5K extit{natural, free-form}, utterances collected by deploying a 2-player object reference game in 3D scenes. Using utterances of either datasets, human listeners can recognize the referred object with high ($>$86\\%, 92\\% resp.) accuracy. By tapping on this data, we develop novel neural listeners that can comprehend object-centric natural language and identify the referred object extit{directly} in a 3D scene. Our key technical contribution is designing an approach for combining linguistic and geometric information (in the form of 3D point-clouds) and creating multi-modal (3D) neural listeners. We also show that architectures which promote object-to-object communication via graph neural networks outperform less context-aware alternatives, and that language-assisted 3D object identification outperforms language-agnostic object classifiers.\"",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that DNNs can be compromised by backdoor attacks crafted at training time. A backdoor attack installs a backdoor into the victim model by injecting a backdoor pattern into a small set of training examples. The victim model behaves normally on clean test data, yet consistently predicts a specific (likely incorrect) target class whenever the backdoor pattern is present in an input example. While existing backdoor attacks are effective, they are not stealthy. The modifications made on training data or labels are often suspicious and can be easily detected by simple data filtering or human inspection. In this paper, we present a new type of backdoor attack inspired by an important natural phenomenon: reflection. Using mathematical modeling of physical reflection models, we propose reflection backdoor (Refool) to plant reflections as backdoor into a victim model. We demonstrate on 3 computer vision tasks and 5 datasets that, Refool can attack state-of-the-art DNNs with high success rate, and is more resistant to state-of-the-art backdoor defenses than existing attacks.\"",

Traditionally, the problem is approached as a single reflection removal problem under very controlled scenarios. In this paper we aim to generalize the reflection removal to real-world scenarios with more complicated light interactions. To this end, we propose a simple yet efficient learning framework for supervised image reflection separation with a polarization simulation engine for synthetic polarized data generation and loss function design. Instead of a conventional image sensor, we use a polarization sensor that instantaneously captures four linearly polarized photos of the scene in the same image. Through a combination of a new polarization-guided image formation model and a novel supervised learning framework for the interpretation of a ray-tracing polarized image formation model, a general method is obtained to tackle general image reflection removal problems. We demonstrate our method with extensive experiments on both real and synthetic data and demonstrate the unprecedented quality of image reconstructions. \"",

In this paper, to model the relations among local image regions, we incorporate the region-based relation reasoning into ZSL. Our method, termed as Region Graph Embedding Network (RGEN), is trained end-to-end from raw image data. Specifically, RGEN consists of two branches: the Constrained Part Attention (CPA) branch and the Parts Relation Reasoning (PRR) branch. CPA branch is built upon attention and produces the image regions. To exploit the progressive interactions among these regions, we represent them as a region graph, on which the parts relation reasoning is performed with graph convolutions, thus leading to our PRR branch. To train our model, we introduce both a transfer loss and a balance loss to contrast class similarities and pursue the maximum response consistency among seen and unseen outputs, respectively. Extensive experiments on four datasets well validate the effectiveness of the proposed method under both ZSL and generalized ZSL settings.\"",

By iteratively and hierarchically fusing the features across different layers of the CNN, our approach gains sufficient semantic information from the input image and pays special attention to the local boundaries with the help of ARM and GCN.

VAT utilizes adversarial samples, generated by injecting perturbation in the input space, for training and thereby enhances the generalization ability of a classifier. However, such adversarial samples can be generated only within a very small area around the input data point, which limits the adversarial effectiveness of such samples. To address this problem we propose LVAT (Latent space VAT), which injects perturbation in the latent space instead of the input space. LVAT can generate adversarial samples flexibly, resulting in more adverse effect and thus more effective regularization. The latent space is built by a generative model, and in this paper we examine two type of models: variational auto-encoder and normalizing flow, specifically Glow. We evaluated the performance of our method in both supervised and semi-supervised learning scenarios for an image classification task using SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets. In our evaluation, we found that our method outperforms VAT and other state-of-the-art methods.\"",

We propose a new weakly supervised method for training CNNs to segment an object of a single class of interest. Instead of ground truth, we guide training with a regularized loss function. Regularized loss models prior knowledge about the likely object shape properties and thus guides segmentation towards the more plausible shapes. Training CNNs with regularized loss is difficult. We develop an annealing strategy that is crucial for successful training. The advantage of our method is simplicity: we use standard CNN architectures and intuitive and computationally efficient loss function. Furthermore, we apply the same loss function for any task/dataset, without any tailoring. We first evaluate our approach for salient object segmentation and co-segmentation. These tasks naturally involve one object class of interest. In some cases, our results are only a few points of standard performance measure behind those obtained training the same CNN with full supervision, and state-of-the art results in weakly supervised setting. Then we adapt our approach to weakly supervised multi-class semantic segmentation and obtain state-of-the-art results. \"",

This is an ill-posed problem with a major difficulty lying in the information loss by depth-agnostic cameras. Conventional approaches sample 3D bounding boxes from the space and infer the relationship between the target object and each of them, however, the probability of effective samples is relatively small in the 3D space. To improve the efficiency of sampling, we propose to start with an initial prediction and refine it gradually towards the ground truth, with only one 3d parameter changed in each step. This requires designing a policy which gets a reward after several steps, and thus we adopt reinforcement learning to optimize it. The proposed framework, Reinforced Axial Refinement Network (RAR-Net), serves as a post-processing stage which can be freely integrated into existing monocular 3D detection methods, and improve the performance on the KITTI dataset with small extra computational costs.\"",

Considering the depth information and affine features, two new constraints on the camera pose are derived. The proposed solver is usable within 1-point RANSAC approaches. Thus, the processing time of the robust estimation is linear in the number of correspondences and, therefore, orders of magnitude faster than by using traditional approaches. The proposed 1AC+D solver is tested both on synthetic data and on 110 395 publicly available real image pairs where we used an off-the-shelf monocular depth network to provide up-to-scale depth per pixel. The proposed 1AC+D leads to similar accuracy as traditional approaches while being significantly faster. When solving large-scale problems, e.g. pose-graph initialization for Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines, the overhead of obtaining ACs and monocular depth is negligible compared to the speed-up gained in the pairwise geometric verification, i.e., relative pose estimation. This is demonstrated on scenes from the 1DSfM dataset using a state-of-the-art global SfM algorithm.\"",

However, two common challenges in developing multi-task models are often overlooked in literature. First, enabling the model to be inherently incremental, continuously incorporating information from new tasks without forgetting the previously learned ones (incremental learning). Second, eliminating adverse interactions amongst tasks, which has been shown to significantly degrade the single-task performance in a multi-task setup (task interference). In this paper, we show that both can be achieved simply by reparameterizing the convolutions of standard neural network architectures into a non-trainable shared part (filter bank) and task-specific parts (modulators), where each modulator has a fraction of the filter bank parameters. Thus, our reparameterization enables the model to learn new tasks without adversely affecting the performance of existing ones. The results of our ablation study attest the efficacy of the proposed reparameterization. Moreover, our method achieves state-of-the-art on two challenging multi-task learning benchmarks, PASCAL-Context and NYUD, and also demonstrates superior incremental learning capability as compared to its close competitors.

To capture this rich visual and semantic context, we propose using two graphs:(1) an attributed spatio-temporal visual graph whose nodes correspond to actors and objects and whose edges encode different types of interactions, and (2) a symbolic graph that models semantic relationships. We further propose a graph neural network for refining the representations of actors, objects and their interactions on the resulting hybrid graph. Our framework goes beyond current approaches that assume nodes and edges of the same type, operate on a fixed graph structure and do not use a symbolic graph. In particular, our framework: a) has specialized attention-based aggregation functions for different node and edge types; b) uses visual edge features; c) integrates visual evidence with label relationships; and d) performs global reasoning in the semantic space. Experiments on challenging video understanding tasks, such as temporal action localization on the Charades dataset, show that the proposed method leads to state-of-the-art performance.\"",

        "abstract": "Region Proposal Network (RPN) provides strong support for handling the scale variation of objects in two-stage object detection. For one-stage detectors which do not have RPN, it is more demanding to have powerful sub-networks capable of directly capturing objects of unknown sizes. To enhance such capability, we propose an extremely efficient neural architecture search method, named Fast And Diverse (FAD), to better explore the optimal configuration of receptive fields and con-volution types in the sub-networks for one-stage detectors. FAD consists of a designed search space and an efficient architecture search algorithm. The search space contains a rich set of diverse transformations designed specifically for object detection. To cope with the designed search space, a novel search algorithm termed Representation Sharing (RepShare) is proposed to effectively identify the best combinations of the defined transformations. In our experiments, FAD obtains prominent improvements on two types of one-stage detectors with various backbones. In particular, our FAD detector achieves 46.4 AP on MS-COCO (under single-scale testing), outperforming the state-of-the-art detectors, including the most recent NAS-based detectors, Auto-FPN [42] (searched for 16 GPU-days) and NAS-FCOS [39] (28 GPU-days), while significantly reduces the search cost to 0.6 GPU-days. Beyond object detection, we further demonstrate the generality of FAD on the more challenging instance segmentation, and expect it to benefit more tasks.\"",

Existing models assume a closed-set setting where both the training and testing classes belong to the same label set. However, due to the unique characteristics of satellite imagery with an extremely vast area of versatile cover materials, the training data are bound to be non-representative. In this paper, we study the problem of open-set land cover classification that identifies the samples belonging to unknown classes during testing, while maintaining performance on known classes. Although inherently a classification problem, both representative and discriminative aspects of data need to be exploited in order to better distinguish unknown classes from known. We propose a representative-discriminative open-set recognition (RDOSR) framework, which 1) projects data from the raw image space to the embedding feature space that facilitates differentiating similar classes, and further 2) enhances both the representative and discriminative capacity through transformation to a so-called abundance space. Experiments on multiple satellite benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We also show the generality of the proposed approach by achieving promising results on open-set classification tasks using RGB images.\"",

It changes the classic residual bottleneck by introducing two design rules: learning inverted residuals and using linear bottlenecks. In this paper, we rethink the necessity of such design change and find it may bring risks of information loss and gradient confusion. We thus propose to flip the structure and present a novel bottleneck design, called sandglass block, that performs identity mapping and spatial transformation at higher dimensions and thus alleviates information loss and gradient confusion effectively. Extensively experiments demonstrate that, different from the common belief, such bottleneck structure is indeed more beneficial than the inverted ones for mobile networks. In ImageNet classification, by simply replacing the inverted residual block with sandglass block, without increasing parameters and computations, the classification accuracy can be improved by more than 1.7% over MobileNetV2. On Pascal VOC 2007 test set, we observe that there is also 0.9% mAP improvement in object detection. We further verify the effectiveness of sandglass block by adding it into the search space of neural architecture search method DARTS. With 25% parameter reduction, the classification accuracy is improved by 0.13% over previous DARTS models. Code will be made publicly available.\"",

        "abstract": "Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) is a task of localizing an object in an image only using image-level labels. To tackle the WSOL problem, most previous studies have followed the conventional class activation mapping (CAM) pipeline: (i) training CNNs for a classification objective, (ii) generating a class activation map via global average pooling (GAP) on feature maps, and (iii) extracting bounding boxes by thresholding based on the maximum value of the class activation map. In this work, we reveal the current CAM approach suffers from three fundamental issues: (i) the bias of GAP that assigns a higher weight to a channel with a small activation area, (ii) negatively weighted activations inside the object regions and (iii) instability from the use of the maximum value of a class activation map as a thresholding reference. They collectively cause the problem that the localization to be highly limited to small regions of an object. We propose three simple but robust techniques that alleviate the problems, including thresholded average pooling, negative weight clamping, and percentile as a standard for thresholding. Our solutions are universally applicable to any WSOL methods using CAM and improve their performance drastically. As a result, we achieve the new state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets of CUB-200-2011, ImageNet-1K, and OpenImages30K.\"",

While advanced models are proposed for image restoration (i.e., background image generation), they regard rain streaks with the same properties as background rather than transmission medium. As vapors (i.e., rain streaks accumulation or fog-like rain) are conveyed in the transmission map to model the veiling effect, the fusion of rain streaks and vapors do not naturally reflect the rain image formation. In this work, we reformulate rain streaks as transmission medium together with vapors to model rain imaging. We propose an encoder-decoder CNN named as SNet to learn the transmission map of rain streaks. As rain streaks appear with various shapes and directions, we use ShuffleNet units within SNet to capture their anisotropic representations. As vapors are brought by rain streaks, we propose a VNet containing spatial pyramid pooling (SSP) to predict the transmission map of vapors in multi-scales based on that of rain streaks. Meanwhile, we use an encoder CNN named ANet to estimate atmosphere light. The SNet, VNet, and ANet are jointly trained to predict transmission maps and atmosphere light for rain image restoration. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed visual model to predict rain streaks and vapors.

While existing methods recover structures and textures step-by-step in the hole regions, they typically use two encoder-decoders for separate recovery. The CNN features of each encoder are learned to capture either missing structures or textures without considering them as a whole. The insufficient utilization of these encoder features hampers the performance of recovering both structures and textures. In this paper, we propose a mutual encoder-decoder CNN for joint recovery of both. We use CNN features from the deep and shallow layers of the encoder to represent structures and textures of an input image, respectively. The deep layer features are sent to a structure branch, while the shallow layer features are sent to a texture branch. In each branch, we fill holes in multiple scales of the CNN features. The filled CNN features from both branches are concatenated and then equalized. During feature equalization, we reweigh channel attentions first and propose a bilateral propagation activation function to enable spatial equalization. To this end, the filled CNN features of structure and texture mutually benefit each other to represent image content at all feature levels. We then use the equalized feature to supplement decoder features for output image generation through skip connections. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method is effective to recover structures and textures and performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches.\"",

It has recently attracted attention focusing on designing complex convolutional neural networks (CNN) which make full use of both low level features and high level semantic information. The heavy networks used in these methods lead to low processing speed, resulting difficulty in applying to real-time applications. In this work, we propose novel perspectives on the DBD problem and design convenient approach to build a real-time cost-effective DBD model. First, we observe that the semantic information does not always relate to and sometimes mislead the blur detection. We start from the essential characteristics of the DBD problem and propose a data augmentation method accordingly to destroy the semantic information and enforce the model to learn image blur related features rather than the semantic features. A novel self-supervision training objective is proposed to enhance the model training consistency and stability. Second, by rethinking the relationship between defocus blur detection and salience detection, we identify two previously ignored but common scenarios, based on which we design a hard mining strategy to enhance the DBD model. By using the proposed techniques, our model that uses a slightly modified U-Net as backbone, improves the processing speed by more than 3 times and performs competitively against state of the art methods. Ablation study is also conducted to verify the effectiveness of each part of our proposed methods.\"",

        "abstract": "The fundamental difficulty in person re-identification (ReID) lies in learning the correspondence among individual cameras. It strongly demands costly inter-camera annotations, yet the trained models are not guaranteed to transfer well to previously unseen cameras. These problems significantly limit the application of ReID. This paper rethinks the working mechanism of conventional ReID approaches and puts forward a new solution. With an effective operator named Camera-based Batch Normalization (CBN), we force the image data of all cameras to fall onto the same subspace, so that the distribution gap between any camera pair is largely shrunk. This alignment brings two benefits. First, the trained model enjoys better abilities to generalize across scenarios with unseen cameras as well as transfer across multiple training sets. Second, we can rely on intra-camera annotations, which have been undervalued before due to the lack of cross-camera information, to achieve competitive ReID performance. Experiments on a wide range of ReID tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at https://github.com/automan000/Camera-based-Person-ReID.\"",

In contrast, to soften typical stereo artefacts, we propose a novel self-supervised paradigm reversing the link between the two. Purposely, in order to train deep stereo networks, we distill knowledge through a monocular completion network. This architecture exploits single-image clues and few sparse points, sourced by traditional stereo algorithms, to estimate dense yet accurate disparity maps by means of a consensus mechanism over multiple estimations. We thoroughly evaluate with popular stereo datasets the impact of different supervisory signals showing how stereo networks trained with our paradigm outperform existing self-supervised frameworks.

To address the problem, we propose a formulation in which the desired rule is changed by manipulating a layer of a deep network as a linear associative memory. We derive an algorithm for modifying one entry of the associative memory, and we demonstrate that several interesting structural rules can be located and modified within the layers of state-of-the-art generative models. We present a user interface to enable users to interactively change the rules of a generative model to achieve desired effects, and we show several proof-of-concept applications.

One particular reason is that events in long and complex videos can consist of multiple heterogeneous sub-activities (in terms of rhythms, activity variants, composition order, etc.) within quite a long period. This fact brings about two main difficulties: excessive/varying length and complex video dynamic/rhythm. To address this, we propose Rhythmic RNN (RhyRNN) which is capable of handling long video sequences (up to 3,000 frames) as well as capturing rhythms at different scales. We also propose two novel modules: diversity-driven pooling (DivPool) and bilinear reweighting (BR), which consistently and hierarchically abstract higher-level information. We study the behavior of RhyRNN and empirically show that our method works well even when mph{only event-level labels are available} in the training stage (compared to algorithms requiring sub-activity labels for recognition), and thus is more practical when the sub-activity labels are missing or difficult to obtain. Extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that, even mph{without fine-tuning the feature backbones}, our method can achieve promising performance for long and complex videos that contain multiple sub-activities.\"",

Motivated by the SSP property and a generalized Runge-Kutta method, we proposed Strong Stability Preserving networks (SSP networks) which improve robustness against adversarial attacks. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed networks improve the robustness against adversarial examples without any defensive methods. Further, the SSP networks are complementary with a state-of-the-art adversarial training scheme. Lastly, our experiments show that SSP networks suppress the blow-up of adversarial perturbations.

To this end, we take temporal motion into consideration when generating lightweight perturbations over the estimated tracking results frame-by-frame. On one hand, we add the temporal perturbations into the original video sequences as adversarial examples to greatly degrade the tracking performance. On the other hand, we sequentially estimate the perturbations from input sequences and learn to eliminate their effect for performance restoration.

First, we observe that examples with uniform random labels have higher losses when trained with stochastic gradient descent under large learning rates. Then, we propose to model the loss distribution of the counterfactual examples using only the network parameters, which is able to model such examples with remarkable success.

However, it performs poorly on contextless texts (e.g., random character sequences) which is unacceptable in most of real application scenarios. In this paper, we first deeply investigate the decoding process of the decoder. We empirically find that a representative character-level sequence decoder utilizes not only context information but also positional information. Contextual information, which the existing approaches heavily rely on, causes the problem of attention drift. To suppress such side-effect, we propose a novel position enhancement branch, and dynamically fuse its outputs with those of the decoder attention module for scene text recognition. Specifically, it contains a position aware module to enable the encoder to output feature vectors encoding their own spatial positions, and an attention module to estimate glimpses using the positional clue (i.e., the current decoding time step) only. The dynamic fusion is conducted for more robust feature via an element-wise gate mechanism. Theoretically, our proposed method, dubbed RobustScanner, decodes individual characters with dynamic ratio between context and positional clues, and utilizes more positional ones when the decoding sequences with scarce context, and thus is robust and practical. Empirically, it has achieved new state-of-the-art results on popular regular and irregular text recognition benchmarks while without much performance drop on contextless benchmarks, validating its robustness in both contextual and contextless application scenarios.\"",

In most existing 3D object detection methods, the norm-based loss is adopted to individually regress the parameters of bounding boxes, which may suffer from the loss-metric mismatch due to the scaling problem. Motivated by the IoU loss in the axis-aligned 2D object detection which is invariant to the scale, our method jointly optimizes the parameters via the $ extit{RIoU}$ loss. To tackle the uncertainty of convex caused by rotation, a projection operation is defined to estimate the intersection area. The calculation process of $ extit{RIoU}$ and its loss function is robust to the rotation condition and feasible for back-propagation, which only comprises basic numerical operations. By incorporating the $ extit{RIoU}$ loss with the conventional norm-based loss function, we enforce the network to directly optimize the $ extit{RIoU}$ . Experimental results on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Moreover, we show that our method is suitable for the detection task of 2D rotated objects, such as text boxes and cluttered targets in the aerial images. \"",

        "abstract": "In the last few years, there has been an increasing trend to consider Structure from Motion (SfM, in computer vision) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM, in robotics) problems from the point of view of pose averaging (also known as global SfM, in computer vision) or Pose Graph Optimization (PGO, in robotics), where the motion of the camera is reconstructed by considering only relative rigid body transformations instead of including also 3-D points (as done in a full Bundle Adjustment). At a high level, the advantage of this approach is that modern solvers can effectively avoid most of the problems of local minima, and that it is easier to reason about outlier poses (caused by feature mismatches and repetitive structures in the images). In this paper, we contribute to the state of the art of the latter, by proposing a method to detect incorrect orientation measurements prior to pose graph optimization by checking the geometric consistency of rotation measurements. The novel aspects of our method are the use of Expectation-Maximization to fine-tune the covariance of the noise in inlier measurements, and a new approximate graph inference procedure, of independent interest, that is specifically designed to take advantage of evidence on cycles with better performance than standard approaches (Belief Propagation). The paper includes simulation and experimental results that evaluate the performance of our outlier detection and cycle-based inference algorithms on synthetic and real-world data.\"",

        "abstract": "Novel view video synthesis aims to synthesize novel viewpoints videos given input captures of a human performance taken from multiple reference viewpoints and over consecutive time steps. Despite great advances in model-free novel view synthesis, existing methods present three limitations when applied to complex and time-varying human performance. First, these methods (and related datasets) mainly consider simple and symmetric objects. Second, they do not enforce explicit consistency across generated views. Third, they focus on static and non-moving objects. The fine-grained details of a human subject can therefore suffer from inconsistencies when synthesized across different viewpoints or time steps. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a human-specific framework that employs a learned 3D-aware representation. Specifically, we first introduce a novel siamese network that employs a gating layer for better reconstruction of the latent volumetric representation and, consequently, final visual results. Moreover, features from consecutive time steps are shared inside the network to improve temporal consistency. Second, we introduce a novel loss to explicitly enforce consistency across generated views both in space and in time. Third, we present the Multi-View Human Action (MVHA) dataset, consisting of near 1200 synthetic human performance captured from 54 viewpoints. Experiments on the MVHA, Pose-Varying Human Model and ShapeNet datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines both in view generation quality and spatio-temporal consistency.\"",

Standard approaches rely on 2D or 3D convolutions to process such context, resulting in expensive operations with millions of parameters. Recent efficient architectures leverage a channel-wise shift-based primitive as a replacement for temporal convolutions, but remain bottlenecked by spatial convolution operations to maintain strong accuracy and a fixed-shift scheme. Naively extending such developments to a 3D setting is a difficult, intractable goal. To this end, we introduce RubiksNet, a new efficient architecture for video action recognition which is based on a proposed learnable 3D spatiotemporal shift operation instead. We analyze the suitability of our new primitive for video action recognition and explore several novel variations of our approach to enable stronger representational flexibility while maintaining an efficient design. We benchmark our approach on several standard video recognition datasets, and observe that our method achieves comparable or better accuracy than prior work on efficient video action recognition at a fraction of the performance cost, with 2.9-5.9x fewer parameters and 2.1-3.7x fewer FLOPs. We also perform a series of controlled ablation studies to verify our significant boost in the efficiency-accuracy tradeoff curve is rooted in the core contributions of our RubiksNet architecture. \"",

        "abstract": "Recently, dynamic inference has emerged as a promising way to reduce the computational cost of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In contrast to static methods (e.g., weight pruning), dynamic inference adaptively adjusts the inference process according to each input sample, which can considerably reduce the computational cost on \"\"easy\"\" samples while maintaining the overall model performance. In this paper, we introduce a general framework, S2DNAS, which can transform various static CNN models to support dynamic inference via neural architecture search. To this end, based on a given CNN model, we first generate a CNN architecture space in which each architecture is a multi-stage CNN generated from the given model using some predefined transformations. Then, we propose a reinforcement learning based approach to automatically search for the optimal CNN architecture in the generated space. At last, with the searched multi-stage network, we can perform dynamic inference by adaptively choosing a stage to evaluate for each sample. Unlike previous works that introduce irregular computations or complex controllers in the inference or re-design a CNN model from scratch, our method can generalize to most of the popular CNN architectures and the searched dynamic network can be directly deployed using existing deep learning frameworks in various hardware devices.\"",

Assessing physical symptoms of individual viewers is challenging but important to provide detailed and personalized guides for viewing safety. In this paper, we propose a novel symptom-aware cybersickness assessment network (SACA Net) that quantifies physical symptom levels for assessing cybersickness of individual viewers. The SACA Net is designed to utilize the relational characteristics of symptoms for complementary effects among relevant symptoms. The proposed network consists of three main parts: a stimulus symptom context guider, a physiological symptom guider, and a symptom relation embedder. The stimulus symptom context guider and the physiological symptom guider extract symptom features from VR content and human physiology, respectively. The symptom relation embedder refines the stimulus-response symptom features to effectively predict cybersickness by embedding relational characteristics with graph formulation. For validation, we utilize two public 360-degree video datasets that contain cybersickness scores and physiological signals. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in predicting human cybersickness with physical symptoms. Further, latent relations among symptoms are interpretable by analyzing relational weights in the proposed network.\"",

The task of unsupervised image classification remains an important, and open challenge in computer vision. Several recent approaches have tried to tackle this problem in an end-to-end fashion. In this paper, we deviate from recent works, and advocate a two-step approach where feature learning and clustering are decoupled. First, a self-supervised task from representation learning is employed to obtain semantically meaningful features. Second, we use the obtained features as a prior in a learnable clustering approach. In doing so, we remove the ability for cluster learning to depend on low-level features, which is present in current end-to-end learning approaches. Experimental evaluation shows that we outperform state-of-the-art methods by large margins, in particular +26.6% on CIFAR10, +25.0% on CIFAR100-20 and +21.3% on STL10 in terms of classification accuracy. Furthermore, our method is the first to perform well on a large-scale dataset for image classification. In particular, we obtain promising results on ImageNet, and outperform several semi-supervised learning methods in the low-data regime without the use of any ground-truth annotations.\"",

To address these limitations, we propose SESAME, a novel generator-discriminator pair for Semantic Editing of Scenes by Adding, Manipulating or Erasing objects. In our setup, the user provides the semantic labels of the areas to be edited and the generator synthesizes the corresponding pixels. In contrast to previous methods that employ a discriminator that concatenates semantics and image as an input, the SESAME discriminator is composed of two input streams that independently process the image and its semantics, using the latter to manipulate the results of the former.

To obtain the single-frame supervision, the annotators are asked to identify only a single frame within the temporal window of an action. This can significantly reduce the labor cost of obtaining full supervision which requires annotating the action boundary. Compared to the weak supervision that only annotates the video-level label, the single-frame supervision introduces extra temporal action signals while maintaining low annotation overhead. To make full use of such single-frame supervision, we propose a unified system called SF-Net. First, we propose to predict an actionness score for each video frame. Along with a typical category score, the actionness score can provide comprehensive information about the occurrence of a potential action and aid the temporal boundary refinement during inference. Second, we mine pseudo action and background frames based on the single-frame annotations. We identify pseudo action frames by adaptively expanding each annotated single frame to its nearby, contextual frames and we mine pseudo background frames from all the unannotated frames across multiple videos. Together with the ground-truth labeled frames, these pseudo-labeled frames are further used for training the classifier.\"",

In this work, we propose a neural network to learn a generative model for sampling consistent indoor scene layouts. Our method learns the co-occurrences, and appearance parameters such as shape and pose, for different objects categories through a grammar-based auto-encoder, resulting in a compact and accurate representation for scene layouts. In contrast to existing grammar-based methods with a user-specified grammar, we construct the grammar automatically by extracting a set of production rules on reasoning about object co-occurrences in training data. The extracted grammar is able to represent a scene by an augmented parse tree. The proposed auto-encoder encodes these parse trees to a latent code, and decodes the latent code to a parse tree, thereby ensuring the generated scene is always valid. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed auto-encoder learns not only to generate valid scenes (i.e. the arrangements and appearances of objects), but it also learns coherent latent representations where nearby latent samples decode to similar scene outputs. The obtained generative model is applicable to several computer vision tasks such as 3D pose and layout estimation from RGB-D data. \"",

In this paper, we introduce SizerNet to predict 3D clothing conditioned on human body shape and garment size parameters, and ParserNet to infer garment meshes and shape under clothing with personal details in a single pass from an input mesh. SizerNet allows to estimate and visualize the dressing effect of a garment in various sizes, and ParserNet allows to edit clothing of an input mesh directly, removing the need for scan segmentation, which is a challenging problem in itself. To learn these models, we introduce the SIZER dataset of clothing size variation which includes 100 different subjects wearing casual clothing items in various sizes, totaling to approximately 2000 scans.

        "abstract": "Recovering multi-person 3D poses with absolute scales from a single RGB image is a challenging problem due to the inherent depth and scale ambiguity from a single view. Addressing this ambiguity requires to aggregate various cues over the entire image, such as body sizes, scene layouts, and inter-person relationships. However, most previous methods adopt a top-down scheme that first performs 2D pose detection and then regresses the 3D pose and scale for each detected person individually, ignoring global contextual cues. In this paper, we propose a novel system that first regresses a set of 2.5D representations of body parts and then reconstructs the 3D absolute poses based on these 2.5D representations with a depth-aware part association algorithm. Such a single-shot bottom-up scheme allows the system to better learn and reason about the inter-person depth relationship, improving both 3D and 2D pose estimation. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the CMU Panoptic and MuPoTS-3D datasets and is applicable to in-the-wild videos.\"",

Existing trajectory predictions are fundamentally limited by lack of diversity in training data, which is difficult to acquire with sufficient coverage of possible modes. Our first contribution is an automatic method to simulate diverse trajectories in the top-view. It uses pre-existing datasets and maps as initialization, mines existing trajectories to represent realistic driving behaviors and uses a multi-agent vehicle dynamics simulator to generate diverse new trajectories that cover various modes and are consistent with scene layout constraints. Our second contribution is a novel method that generates diverse predictions while accounting for scene semantics and multi-agent interactions, with constant-time inference independent of the number of agents. We propose a convLSTM with novel state pooling operations and losses to predict scene-consistent states of multiple agents in a single forward pass, along with a CVAE for diversity. We validate our proposed multi-agent trajectory prediction approach by training and testing on the proposed simulated dataset and existing real datasets of traffic scenes. In both cases, our approach outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin, highlighting the benefits of both our diverse dataset simulation and constant-time diverse trajectory prediction methods.\"",

The recent efforts made in data-fusion convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have significantly improved semantic driving scene segmentation. Freespace can be hypothesized as a ground plane, on which the points have similar surface normals.

Furthermore, we propose a data-fusion CNN architecture, referred to as RoadSeg, which can extract and fuse features from both RGB images and the inferred surface normal information for accurate freespace detection. For research purposes, we publish a large-scale synthetic freespace detection dataset, named Ready-to-Drive (R2D) road dataset, collected under different illumination and weather conditions.

        "abstract": "Dense Video Captioning (DVC) is a challenging task that localizes all events in a short video and describes them with natural language sentences. The main goal of DVC is video story description, that is, to generate a concise video story that supports human video comprehension without watching it. In recent years, DVC has attracted increasing attention in the research community of Vision and Language, and has been employed as a task of the workshop, ActivityNet Challenge. In the current research community, the official scorer provided by AcivityNet Challenge is the de-facto standard evaluation framework for DVC systems. It computes averaged METEOR scores for matched pairs between generated and reference captions whose Interval of Union (IoU) exceeds a specific threshold value. However, the current framework does not take into account the story of the video, the ordering of captions. It also tends to give high scores to systems that generate redundant, several hundred captions, that humans cannot read. This paper proposes a new evaluation framework, Story Oriented Dense video cAptioning evaluation framework (SODA), for measuring the performance of video story description systems. SODA first tries to find temporally optimal matching between generated and reference captions to capture a story for a video. Then, it computes METEOR scores for the matching and derives F-measure scores from the METEOR scores to penalize redundant captions. To demonstrate that SODA gives low scores for inadequate captions in terms of video story description, we evaluate two state-of-the-art systems with it, varying the number of captions. The results show that SODA can give low scores against too many or too few captions and high scores against captions whose number equals to that of a reference, while the current framework gives good scores for all the cases. Furthermore, we show that SODA tends to give lower scores than the current evaluation framework in evaluating captions with incorrect order.\"",

One is focused on second-order spatial information to increase the performance of image descriptors, both local and global. It is used to re-weight feature maps, and thus emphasise salient image locations that are subsequently used for description. The second component is concerned with a second-order similarity (SOS) loss, that we extend to global descriptors for image retrieval, and is used to enhance the triplet loss with hard-negative mining. We validate our approach on two different tasks and datasets for image retrieval and image matching. The results show that our two second-order components complement each other, bringing significant performance improvements in both tasks and lead to state-of-the-art results across the public benchmarks.

In order to predict a mask for each instance, mainstream approaches either follow the 'detect-thensegment' strategy as used by Mask R-CNN, or predict category masks first then use clustering techniques to group pixels into individual instances. We view the task of instance segmentation from a completely new perspective by introducing the notion of \"\"instance categories\"\", which assigns categories to each pixel within an instance according to the instance's location and size, thus nicely converting instance mask segmentation into a single-shot classification-solvable problem. We demonstrate a much simpler and flexible instance segmentation framework with strong performance, achieving on par accuracy with Mask R-CNN and outperforming recent single-shot instance segmenters in accuracy. We hope that this very simple and strong framework can serve as a baseline for many instance-level recognition tasks besides instance segmentation.\"",

        "abstract": "Adversarial attacks of deep neural networks have been intensively studied on image, audio, natural language, patch, and pixel classification tasks. Nevertheless, as a typical, while important real-world application, the adversarial attacks of online video object tracking that traces an object's moving trajectory instead of its category are rarely explored. In this paper, we identify a new task for the adversarial attack to visual tracking: online generating imperceptible perturbations that mislead trackers along with an incorrect (Untargeted Attack, UA) or specified trajectory (Targeted Attack, TA). To this end, we first propose a spatial-aware basic attack by adapting existing attack methods, \\ie, FGSM, BIM, and C\\&W, and comprehensively analyze the attacking performance. We identify that online object tracking poses two new challenges: 1) it is difficult to generate imperceptible perturbations that can transfer across frames, and 2) real-time trackers require the attack to satisfy a certain level of efficiency. To address these challenges, we further propose the spatial-aware online incremental attack (a.k.a. SPARK) that performs spatial-temporal sparse incremental perturbations online and makes the adversarial attack less perceptible. In addition, as an optimization-based method, SPARK quickly converges to very small losses within several iterations by considering historical incremental perturbations, making it much more efficient than basic attacks. The in-depth evaluation of state-of-the-art trackers (i.e., SiamRPN++ with AlexNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet-50, and SiamDW) on OTB100, VOT2018, UAV123, and LaSOT demonstrates the effectiveness and transferability of SPARK in misleading the trackers under both UA and TA with minor perturbations.\"",

In this work, we therefore propose SRFlow: a normalizing flow based super-resolution method capable of learning the conditional distribution of the output given the low-resolution input. Our model is trained in a principled manner using a single loss, namely the negative log-likelihood. SRFlow therefore directly accounts for the ill-posed nature of the problem, and learns to predict diverse photo-realistic high-resolution images. Moreover, we utilize the strong image posterior learned by SRFlow to design flexible image manipulation techniques, capable of enhancing super-resolved images by, e.g., transferring content from other images. We perform extensive experiments on faces, as well as on super-resolution in general. SRFlow outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based approaches in terms of both PSNR and perceptual quality metrics, while allowing for diversity through the exploration of the space of super-resolved solutions.\"",

        "abstract": "Human poses that are rare or unseen in a training set are challenging for a network to predict. Similar to the long-tailed distribution problem in visual recognition, the small number of examples for such poses limits the ability of networks to model them. Interestingly, local pose distributions suffer less from the long-tail problem, i.e., local joint configurations within a rare pose may appear within other poses in the training set, making them less rare. We propose to take advantage of this fact for better generalization to rare and unseen poses. To be specific, our method splits the body into local regions and processes them in separate network branches, utilizing the property that a joint\u2019s position depends mainly on the joints within its local body region. Global coherence is maintained by recombining the global context from the rest of the body into each branch as a low-dimensional vector. With the reduced dimensionality of less relevant body areas, the training set distribution within network branches more closely reflects the statistics of local poses instead of global body poses, without sacrificing information important for joint inference. The proposed split-and-recombine approach, called SRNet, can be easily adapted to both single-image and temporal models, and it leads to appreciable improvements in the prediction of rare and unseen poses.\"",

        "abstract": "Existing facial attribute editing methods typically employ an encoder-decoder architecture where the attribute information is expressed as a conditional one-hot vector spatially concatenated with the image or intermediate feature maps. However, such operations only learn the local semantic mapping but ignore global facial statistics. In this work, we focus on solving this issue by editing the channel-wise global information denoted as the style feature. We develop a style skip connection based generative adversarial network, referred to as SSCGAN which enables accurate facial attribute manipulation. Specifically, we inject the target attribute information into multiple style skip connection paths between the encoder and decoder. Each connection extracts the style feature of the latent feature maps in the encoder and then performs a residual learning based mapping function in the global information space guided by the target attributes. In the following, the adjusted style feature will be utilized as the conditional information for instance normalization to transform the corresponding latent feature maps in the decoder. In addition, to avoid the vanishing of spatial details ( extit{e.g.} hairstyle or pupil locations), we further introduce the skip connection based spatial information transfer module. Through the global-wise style and local-wise spatial information manipulation, the proposed method can produce better results in terms of attribute generation accuracy and image quality. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.\"",

In this paper, we propose a novel 3D shape signature to explore the shape information from point clouds. By incorporating operations of symmetry, convex hull and chebyshev fitting, the proposed shape sig-nature is not only compact and effective but also robust to the noise, which serves as a soft constraint to improve the feature capability of multi-class discrimination. Based on the proposed shape signature, we develop the shape signature networks (SSN) for 3D object detection, which consist of pyramid feature encoding part, shape-aware grouping heads and explicit shape encoding objective. Experiments show that the proposed method performs remarkably better than existing methods on two large-scale datasets. Furthermore, our shape signature could act as a plug-and-play component and ablation study shows its effectiveness and good scalability\"",

        "abstract": "The SMPL body model is widely used for the estimation, synthesis, and analysis of 3D human pose and shape. While popular, we show that SMPL has several limitations and introduce STAR, which is quantitatively and qualitatively superior to SMPL. First, SMPL has a huge number of parameters resulting from its use of global blend shapes. These dense pose-corrective offsets relate every vertex on the mesh to all the joints in the kinematic tree, capturing spurious long-range cor- relations. To address this, we define per-joint pose correctives and learn the subset of mesh vertices that are influenced by each joint movement. This sparse formulation results in more realistic deformations and significantly reduces the number of model parameters to 20% of SMPL. When trained on the same data as SMPL, STAR generalizes better despite having many fewer parameters. Second, SMPL factors pose-dependent deformations from body shape while, in reality, people with different shapes deform differently. Consequently, we learn shape-dependent pose- corrective blendshapes that depend on both body pose and BMI. Third, we show that the shape space of SMPL is not rich enough to capture the variation in the human population. We address this by training STAR with an additional 10,000 scans of male and female subjects, and show that this results in better model generalization. STAR is compact, generalizes better to new bodies and is a drop-in replacement for SMPL. STAR is publicly available for research purposes at http://star.is.tue.mpg.de.\"",

Multiple networks are used to detect objects in individual frames, and then associate these detections over time. Hence, these methods are often non-end-to-end trainable and highly tailored to specific tasks. In this paper, we propose a different approach that is well-suited to a variety of tasks involving instance segmentation in videos. In particular, we model a video clip as a single 3D spatio-temporal volume, and propose a novel approach that segments and tracks instances across space and time in a single stage. Our problem formulation is centered around the idea of spatio-temporal embeddings which are trained to cluster pixels belonging to a specific object instance over an entire video clip. To this end, we introduce (i) novel mixing functions that enhance the feature representation of spatio-temporal embeddings, and (ii) a single-stage, proposal-free network that can reason about temporal context. Our network is trained end-to-end to learn spatio-temporal embeddings as well as parameters required to cluster these embeddings, thus simplifying inference. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets and tasks.\"",

        "abstract": "Low-resolution text images are often seen in natural scenes such as documents captured by mobile phones. Recognizing low-resolution text images is challenging because they lose detailed content information, leading to poor recognition accuracy. An intuitive solution is to introduce super-resolution (SR) techniques as pre-processing. However, previous single image super-resolution (SISR) methods are trained on synthetic low resolution images (e.g.Bicubic down-sampling), which is simple and not suitable for real low-resolution text recognition. To this end, we propose a real scene text SR dataset, termed TextZoom. It contains paired real low-resolution and high-resolution images which are captured by cameras with different focal length in the wild. It is more authentic and challenging than synthetic data, as shown in Fig. 1. We argue improving the recognition accuracy is the ultimate goal for SceneText SR. In this purpose, a new Text Super-Resolution Network, termed TSRN, with three novel modules is developed. (1) A sequential residual block is proposed to extract the sequential information of the text images. (2) A boundary-aware loss is designed to sharpen the character boundaries.(3) A central alignment module is proposed to relieve the misalignment problem in TextZoom. Extensive experiments on TextZoom demonstrate that our TSRN largely improves the recognition accuracy by over 13%of CRNN, and by nearly 9.0% of ASTER and MORAN compared to synthetic SR data. Furthermore, our TSRN clearly outperforms 7 state-of-the-art SR methods in boosting the recognition accuracy of LR images in TextZoom. For example, it outperforms LapSRN by over 5% and 8%on the recognition accuracy of ASTER and CRNN. Our results suggest that low-resolution text recognition in the wild is far from being solved, thus more research effort is needed\"",

Our key idea is to jointly optimize for both CAD model alignments as well as layout estimations of the scanned scene, explicitly modeling inter-relationships between objects-to-objects and objects-to-layout. Since object arrangement and scene layout are intrinsically coupled, we show that treating the problem jointly significantly helps to produce globally-consistent representations of a scene. Object CAD models are aligned to the scene by establishing dense correspondences between geometry, and we introduce a hierarchical layout prediction approach to estimate layout planes from corners and edges of the scene. To this end, we propose a message-passing graph neural network to model the inter-relationships between objects and layout, guiding generation of a globally object alignment in a scene. By considering the global scene layout, we achieve significantly improved CAD alignments compared to state-of-the-art methods, improving from 41.83% to 58.41% alignment accuracy on SUNCG and from 50.05% to 61.24% on ScanNet, respectively. The resulting CAD-based representations makes our method well-suited for applications in content creation such as augmented- or virtual reality.\"",

Box tracks are annotated efficiently by approximating the trajectory using a parametric curve with a small number of control points which the annotator can interactively correct. Our approach tolerates a modest amount of noise in box placements, thus typically requiring only a few clicks to annotate a track to a sufficient accuracy. Segmentation masks are corrected via scribbles which are propagated through time. We show significant performance gains in annotation efficiency over past work. We show that our ScribbleBox approach reaches 88.92% J&F on DAVIS2017 with an average of 9.14 clicks per box track, and only 4 frames requiring scribble annotation in a video of 65.3 frames on average.\"",

Learning to find an optimal mixed precision model that can preserve accuracy and satisfy the specific constraints on model size and computation is extremely challenge due to the difficult in training a mixed precision model and the huge space of all possible bit quantizations. In this paper, we propose a novel soft Barrier Penalty based NAS (BP-NAS) for mixed precision quantization, which ensures all the searched models are inside the valid domain defined by the complexity constraint, thus could return an optimal model under the given constraint by conducting search only one time. The proposed soft Barrier Penalty is differentiable and can impose very large losses to those models outside the valid domain while almost no punishment for models inside the valid domain, thus constraining the search only in the feasible domain. In addition, a differentiable Prob-1 regularizer is proposed to ensure learning with NAS is reasonable. A distribution reshaping training strategy is also used to make training more stable. BP-NAS sets new state of the arts on both classification (Cifar-10, ImageNet) and detection (COCO), surpassing all the efficient mixed precision methods designed manually and automatically. Particularly, BP-NAS achieves higher mAP (up to 2.7% mAP improvement) together with lower bit computation cost compared with the existing best mixed precision model on COCO detection.\"",

Given the limited hardware resources, existing 3D perception models are not able to recognize small instances (e.g., pedestrians, cyclists) very well due to the low-resolution voxelization and aggressive downsampling. To this end, we propose Sparse Point-Voxel Convolution (SPVConv), a lightweight 3D module that equips the vanilla Sparse Convolution with the high-resolution point-based branch. With negligible overhead, this point-based branch is able to preserve the fine details even from large outdoor scenes. To explore the spectrum of efficient 3D models, we first define a flexible architecture design space based on SPVConv, and we then present 3D Neural Architecture Search (3D-NAS) to search the optimal network architecture over this diverse design space efficiently and effectively. Experimental results validate that the resulting SPVNAS model is fast and accurate: it outperforms the state-of-the-art MinkowskiNet by 3.3%, ranking 1st on the competitive SemanticKITTI leaderboard. It also achieves 8-24\u00d7 computation reduction and 3-35\u00d7 measured speedup over MinkowskiNet and KPConv with higher accuracy. Finally, we transfer our method to 3D object detection, and it achieves consistent improvements over the one-stage detection baseline on KITTI.\"",

However, as affected by the inherent receptive field, convolution based feature extraction inevitably mixes up the foreground features and the background features, resulting in ambiguities in the subsequent instance association. In this paper, we propose a highly effective method for learning instance embeddings based on segments by converting the compact image representation to un-ordered 2D point cloud representation. Our method generates a new tracking-by-points paradigm where discriminative instance embeddings are learned from randomly selected points rather than images. Furthermore, multiple informative data modalities are converted into point-wise representations to enrich point-wise features. The resulting online MOTS framework, named PointTrack, surpasses all the state-of-the-art methods including 3D tracking methods by large margins (5.4\\% higher MOTSA and 18 times faster over MOTSFusion) with the near real-time speed (22 FPS). Evaluations across three datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Moreover, based on the observation that current MOTS datasets lack crowded scenes, we build a more challenging MOTS dataset named APOLLO MOTS with higher instance density. Both APOLLO MOTS and our codes are publicly available at https://github.com/detectRecog/PointTrack.\"",

We present the first attacks and defenses for complex, state of the art models for semantic segmentation.

Segmenting transparent objects is challenging because these objects have diverse appearances inherited from the image background, making them had similar appearance with their surroundings. Besides the technical diculty of this task, only a few previous datasets were specially designed and collected to explore this task and most of the existing datasets have major drawbacks. They either possess limited sample size such as merely a thousand of images without manual annotations, or they generate all images by using computer graphics method (i.e. not real image). To address this important problem, this work proposes a large-scale dataset for transparent object segmentation, named Trans10K, consisting of 10,428 images of real scenarios with carefully manual annotations, which are 10 times larger than the existing datasets. The transparent objects in Trans10K are extremely challenging due to high diversity in scale, viewpoint and occlusion as shown in Fig. 1. To evaluate theeffectiveness of Trans10K, we propose a novel boundary-aware segmentation method, termed TransLab, which exploits boundary as the clue to improve segmentation of transparent objects. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of Trans10K and validate the practicality of learning object boundary in TransLab. For example, TransLab significantly outperforms 20 recent object segmentation methods based on deep learning, showing that this task is largely unsolved. We believe that both Trans10K and TransLab have important contributions to both the academia and industry, facilitating future researches and applications.\"",

We introduce a simple training heuristic, Representation Self-Challenging (RSC), that significantly improves the generalization of CNN to the out-of-domain data. RSC iteratively challenges (discards) the dominant features activated on the training data, and forces the network to activate remaining features that correlate with labels. This process appears to activate feature representations applicable to out-of-domain data without prior knowledge of the new domain and without learning extra network parameters.

Distinct from most existing methods that focus on designing convolutional operators, our method designs a new learning scheme to enhance point relation exploring for better segmentation.

Then we use label propagation algorithm to predict labels of one subset when given labels of the other subset. By training with this Self-Prediction task, the backbone network is constrained to fully explore relational context/geometric/shape information and learn more discriminative features for segmentation. Moreover, a general associated framework equipped with our Self-Prediction scheme is designed for enhancing instance and semantic segmentation simultaneously, where instance and semantic representations are combined to perform Self-Prediction. Through this way, instance and semantic segmentation are collaborated and mutually reinforced. Significant performance improvements on instance and semantic segmentation compared with baseline are achieved on S3DIS and ShapeNet.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of the audio-visual object embeddings that our model learns by using them for four downstream speech-oriented tasks: (a) multi-speaker sound source separation, (b) localizing and tracking speakers, (c) correcting misaligned audio-visual data, and (d) active speaker detection. Using our representation, these tasks can be solved entirely by training on unlabeled video, without the aid of object detectors. We also demonstrate the generality of our method by applying it to non-human speakers, including cartoons and puppets. Our model significantly outperforms other self-supervised approaches, and obtains performance competitive with methods that use supervised face detection.\"",

In contrast to previous works that only enforce 2D feature constraints, we propose a self-supervised training architecture by leveraging the multi-view geometry consistency, which provides reliable constraints on face pose and depth estimation. We first propose an occlusion-aware view synthesis method to apply multi-view geometry consistency to self-supervised learning. Then we design three novel loss functions for multi-view consistency, including the pixel consistency loss, the depth consistency loss, and the facial landmark-based epipolar loss. Our method is accurate and robust, especially under large variations of expressions, poses, and illumination conditions.

Although self-supervised learning has recently spread across many computer vision tasks, it has been barely considered in the field of confidence estimation.

Our approach relies on the minimum information available in any stereo setup (\\ie, the input stereo pair and the output disparity map) to learn an effective confidence measure. This strategy allows us not only a seamless integration with any stereo system, including consumer and industrial devices equipped with undisclosed stereo perception methods, but also, due to its self-adapting capability, for its out-of-the-box deployment in the field. Exhaustive experimental results with different standard datasets support our claims, showing how our solution is the first-ever enabling online learning of accurate confidence estimation for any stereo system and without any requirement for the end-user.\"",

This process is time-consuming because of the large search space in the gigapixel WSIs, causing chances of omission and misinterpretation at indistinct tumor lesions. To tackle this, the development of an automated cancerous region segmentation method is imperative. We frame this issue as a modeling problem with partial label WSIs, where some cancerous regions may be misclassified as benign and vice versa, producing patches with noisy labels. To learn from these patches, we propose Self-similarity Student, combining teacher-student model paradigm with similarity learning. Specifically, for each patch, we first sample its similar and dissimilar patches according to spatial distance. A teacher-student model is then introduced, featuring the exponential moving average on both student model weights and teacher predictions ensemble. While our student model takes patches, teacher model takes all their corresponding similar and dissimilar patches for learning robust representation against noisy label patches. Following this similarity learning, our similarity ensemble merges similar patches\u2019 ensembled predictions as the pseudo-label of a given patch to counteract its noisy label. On the CAMELYON16 dataset, our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art noise-aware learning methods by 5% and the supervised-trained baseline by 10% in various degrees of noise. Moreover, our method is superior to the baseline on our TVGH TURP dataset with 2% improvement, demonstrating the generalizability to more clinical histopathology segmentation tasks.\"",

Built upon Bayesian deep network, the proposed method trains a network with random weights that predicts the target image for recovery with uncertainty. Such uncertainty enables the prediction of the target image with small mean squared error by averaging multiple predictions. The proposed method is applied for image reconstruction in compressive sensing (CS), i.e., reconstructing an image from few measurements. The experiments showed that the proposed dataset-free deep learning method not only significantly outperforms traditional non-learning methods, but also is very competitive to the state-of-the-art supervised deep learning methods, especially when the measurements are few and noisy.\"",

The proposed method does not necessitate 3D supervision, manually annotated keypoints, multi-view images of an object or a prior 3D template. The key insight of our work is that objects can be represented as a collection of deformable parts, and each part is semantically coherent across different instances of the same category (e.g., wings on birds and wheels on cars). Therefore, by leveraging self-supervisedly learned part segmentation of a large collection of category-specific images, we can effectively enforce semantic consistency between the reconstructed meshes and the original images. This significantly reduces ambiguities during joint prediction of shape and camera pose of an object, along with texture. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to try and solve the single-view reconstruction problem without a category-specific template mesh or semantic keypoints. Thus our model can easily generalize to various object categories without such labels, e.g., horses, penguins, etc. Through a variety of experiments on several categories of deformable and rigid objects, we demonstrate that our unsupervised method performs comparably if not better than existing category-specific reconstruction methods learned with supervision.\"",

However, the general public benchmarks only provide noisy GPS labels associated with the training images, which act as weak supervisions for learning image-to-image similarities. Such label noise prevents deep neural networks from learning discriminative features for accurate localization. To tackle this challenge, we propose to self-supervise image-to-region similarities in order to fully explore the potential of difficult positive images alongside their sub-regions. The estimated image-to-region similarities can serve as extra training supervision for improving the network in generations, which could in turn gradually refine the fine-grained similarities to achieve optimal performance. Our proposed self-enhanced image-to-region similarity labels effectively deal with the training bottleneck in the state-of-the-art pipelines without any additional parameters or manual annotations in both training and inference. Our method outperforms state-of-the-arts on the standard localization benchmarks by noticeable margins and shows excellent generalization capability on multiple image retrieval datasets.\"",

To overcome this shortcoming, we propose the idea of monocular 6D pose estimation by means of self-supervised learning, removing the need for real annotations. After training our proposed network fully supervised with synthetic RGB data, we leverage recent advances in neural rendering to further self-supervise the model on unannotated real RGB-D data, seeking for a visually and geometrically optimal alignment.

However, this will require labeling millions of frames required for training RL policies, which is infeasible. Instead, we explore a self-supervised approach for training our exploration policy by introducing a notion of semantic curiosity. Our semantic curiosity policy is based on a simple observation -- the detection outputs should be consistent. Therefore, our semantic curiosity rewards trajectories with inconsistent labeling behavior and encourages the exploration policy to explore such areas. The exploration policy trained via semantic curiosity generalizes to novel scenes and helps train an object detector that outperforms baselines trained with other possible alternatives such as random exploration, prediction-error curiosity, and coverage-maximizing exploration.\"",

On the other hand, the data augmentation, as one of the major tricks for DNN, has been widely used in many computer vision tasks. However, there are few works studying the data augmentation problem for VQA and none of the existing image based augmentation schemes (such as rotation and flipping) can be directly applied to VQA due to its semantic structure -- an $\\langle image, question, answer\rangle$ triplet needs to be maintained correctly. For example, a direction related Question-Answer (QA) pair may not be true if the associated image is rotated or flipped. In this paper, instead of directly manipulating images and questions, we use generated adversarial examples for both images and questions as the augmented data. The augmented examples do not change the visual properties presented in the image as well as the extbf{semantic} meaning of the question, the correctness of the $\\langle image, question, answer\rangle$ is thus still maintained. We then use adversarial learning to train a classic VQA model (BUTD) with our augmented data. We find that we not only improve the overall performance on VQAv2, but also can withstand adversarial attack effectively, compared to the baseline model.

        "abstract": "Most existing crowd counting systems rely on the availability of the object location annotation which can be expensive to obtain. To reduce the annotation cost, one attractive solution is to leverage a large number of unlabeled images to build a crowd counting model in semi-supervised fashion. This paper tackles the semi-supervised crowd counting problem from the perspective of feature learning. Our key idea is to leverage the unlabeled images to train a generic feature extractor rather than the entire network of a crowd counter. The rationale of this design is that learning the feature extractor can be more reliable and robust towards the inevitable noisy supervision generated from the unlabeled data. Also, on top of a good feature extractor, it is possible to build a density map regressor with much fewer density map annotations. Specifically, we proposed a novel semi-supervised crowd counting method which is built upon two innovative components: (1) a set of inter-related binary segmentation tasks are derived from the original density map regression task as the surrogate prediction target; (2) the surrogate target predictors are learned from both labeled and unlabeled data by utilizing a proposed self-training scheme which fully exploits the underlying constraints of these binary segmentation tasks. Through experiments, we show that the proposed method is superior over the existing semi-supervised crowd counting method and other representative baselines.\"",

In this work, we augment such supervised segmentation models by allowing them to learn from unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised approach, termed Error-Correcting Supervision, leverages a collaborative strategy. Apart from the supervised training on the labeled data, the segmentation network is judged by an additional network. The secondary correction network learns on the labeled data to optimally spot correct predictions, as well as to amend incorrect ones. As auxiliary regularization term, the corrector directly influences the supervised training of the segmentation network. On unlabeled data, the output of the correction network is essential to create a proxy for the unknown truth. The corrector's output is combined with the segmentation network's prediction to form the new target. We propose a loss function that incorporates both the pseudo-labels as well as the predictive certainty of the correction network. Our approach can easily be added to supervised segmentation models. We show consistent improvements over a supervised baseline on experiments on both the Pascal VOC 2012 and the Cityscapes datasets with varying amounts of labeled data. \"",

In many applications of vision algorithms, the precise recognition of visual attributes of objects is important but still challenging. This is because defining a class hierarchy of attributes is ambiguous, so training data inevitably suffer from class imbalance and label sparsity, leading to a lack of effective annotations. An intuitive solution is to find a method to effectively learn image representations by utilizing unlabeled images. With that in mind, we propose a multi-teacher-single-student (MTSS) approach inspired by the multi-task learning and the distillation of semi-supervised learning. Our MTSS learns task-specific domain experts called teacher networks using the label embedding technique and learns a unified model called a student network by forcing a model to mimic the distributions learned by domain experts. Our experiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves competitive performance on various benchmarks for fashion attribute prediction, but also improves robustness and cross-domain adaptability for unseen domains.\"",

In real-world application, besides massive amount of weakly-supervised data there are usually a few available pixel-level annotations, based on which semi-supervised track becomes a promising way for semantic segmentation. Current methods simply bundle these two different sets of annotations together to train a segmentation network. However, we discover that such treatment is problematic and achieves even worse results than just using strong labels, which indicates the misuse of the weak ones. To fully explore the potential of the weak labels, we propose to impose separate treatments of strong and weak annotations via a strong-weak dual-branch network, which discriminates the massive inaccurate weak supervisions from those strong ones. We design a shared network component to exploit the joint discrimination of strong and weak annotations; meanwhile, the proposed dual branches separately handle full and weak supervised learning and effectively eliminate their mutual interference. This simple architecture requires only slight additional computational costs during training yet brings significant improvements over the previous methods. Experiments on two standard benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method.\"",

SemifreddoNets work as fully-pipelined hardware blocks that are optimized to have an efficient hardware implementation. Those blocks freeze a certain portion of the parameters at every layer and replace the corresponding multipliers with fixed scalers. Fixing the weights reduces the silicon area, logic delay, and memory requirements, leading to significant savings in cost and power consumption. Unlike traditional layer-wise freezing approaches, SemifreddoNets make a profitable trade between the cost and flexibility by having some of the weights configurable at different scales and levels of abstraction in the model. Although fixing the topology and some of the weights somewhat limits the flexibility, we argue that the efficiency benefits of this strategy outweigh the advantages of a fully configurable model for many use cases. Furthermore, our system uses repeatable blocks, therefore it has the flexibility to adjust model complexity without requiring any hardware change. The hardware implementation of SemifreddoNets provides up to an order of magnitude reduction in silicon area and power consumption as compared to their equivalent implementation on a general-purpose accelerator.\"",

Recent research has explored the usage of visual information as guidance to generate binaural or ambisonic audio from mono ones with stereo supervision. However, this fully supervised paradigm suffers from an inherent drawback: the recording of stereophonic audio usually requires delicate devices that are expensive for wide accessibility. To overcome this challenge, we propose to leverage the vastly available mono data to facilitate the generation of stereophonic audio. Our key observation is that the task of visually indicated audio separation also maps independent audios to their corresponding visual positions, which shares a similar objective with stereophonic audio generation. We integrate both stereo generation and source separation into a unified framework, Sep-Stereo, by considering source separation as a particular type of audio spatialization. Specifically, a novel associative pyramid network architecture is carefully designed for audio-visual feature fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can improve the stereophonic audio generation results while performing accurate sound separation with a shared backbone.\"",

Most of the studies, however, have performed frame-by-frame estimation based on independent static images. In this paper, we attempt to not only consider the appearance of a hand but incorporate the temporal movement information of a hand in motion into the learning framework for better 3D hand pose estimation performance, which leads to the necessity of a large scale dataset with sequential RGB hand images. We propose a novel method that generates a synthetic dataset that mimics natural human hand movements by re-engineering annotations of an extant static hand pose dataset into pose-flows. With the generated dataset, we train a newly proposed recurrent framework, exploiting visuo-temporal features from sequential images of synthetic hands in motion and emphasizing temporal smoothness of estimations with a temporal consistency constraint. Our novel training strategy of detaching the recurrent layer of the framework during domain finetuning from synthetic to real allows preservation of the visuo-temporal features learned from sequential synthetic hand images. Hand poses that are sequentially estimated consequently produce natural and smooth hand movements which lead to more robust estimations. We show that utilizing temporal information for 3D hand pose estimation significantly enhances general pose estimations by outperforming state-of-the-art methods in experiments on hand pose estimation benchmarks.\"",

        "abstract": "Structure learning for 3D shapes is vital for 3D computer vision. State-of-the-art methods show promising results by representing shapes using implicit functions in 3D that are learned using discriminative neural networks. However, learning implicit functions requires dense and irregular sampling in 3D space, which also makes the sampling methods affect the accuracy of shape reconstruction during test. To avoid dense and irregular sampling in 3D, we propose to represent shapes using 2D functions, where the output of the function at each 2D location is a sequence of line segments inside the shape. Our approach leverages the power of functional representations, but without the disadvantage of 3D sampling. Specifically, we use a voxel tubelization to represent a voxel grid as a set of tubes along any one of the X, Y, or Z axes. Each tube can be indexed by its 2D coordinates on the plane spanned by the other two axes. We further simplify each tube into a sequence of occupancy segments. Each occupancy segment consists of successive voxels occupied by the shape, which leads to a simple representation of its 1D start and end location. Given the 2D coordinates of the tube and a shape feature as condition, this representation enables us to learn 3D shape structures by sequentially predicting the start and end locations of each occupancy segment in the tube. We implement this approach using a Seq2Seq model with attention, called SeqXY2SeqZ, which learns the mapping from a sequence of 2D coordinates along two arbitrary axes to a sequence of 1D locations along the third axis. SeqXY2SeqZ not only benefits from the regularity of voxel grids in training and testing, but also achieves high memory efficiency. Our experiments show that SeqXY2SeqZ outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under the widely used benchmarks.\"",

We approach this highly under-constrained problem in a ``analysis by synthesis\"\" framework where the goal is to predict the likely shape, texture and camera viewpoint that could produce the image with various learned category-specific priors. Our particular contribution in this paper is a representation of the distribution over cameras, which we call ``camera-multiplex\"\". Instead of picking a point estimate, we maintain a set of camera hypotheses that are optimized during training to best explain the image given the current shape and texture. We call our approach Unsupervised Category-Specific Mesh Reconstruction (U-CMR), and present qualitative and quantitative results on CUB, Pascal 3D and new web-scraped datasets. We obtain state-of-the-art camera prediction results and show that we can learn to predict diverse shapes and textures across objects using an image collection without any keypoint annotations or 3D ground truth.

        "abstract": "We address the problem of domain adaptation in videos for the task of human action recognition. Inspired by image-based domain adaptation, we can perform video adaptation by aligning the features of frames or clips of source and target videos. However, equally aligning all clips is sub-optimal as not all clips are informative for the task. As the first novelty, we propose an attention mechanism which focuses on more discriminative clips and directly optimizes for video-level (cf. clip-level) alignment. As the backgrounds are often very different between source and target, the source background-corrupted model adapts poorly to target domain videos. To alleviate this, as a second novelty, we propose to use the clip order prediction as an auxiliary task. The clip order prediction loss, when combined with domain adversarial loss, encourages learning of representations which focus on the humans and objects involved in the actions, rather than the uninformative and widely differing (between source and target) backgrounds. We empirically show that both components contribute positively towards adaptation performance. We report state-of-the-art performances on two out of three challenging public benchmarks, two based on the UCF and HMDB datasets, and one on Kinetics to NEC-Drone datasets. We also support the intuitions and the results with qualitative results.\"",

        "abstract": "Current object detection frameworks mainly rely on bounding box regression to localize objects. Despite the remarkable progress in recent years, the precision of bounding box regression remains unsatisfactory, hence limiting performance in object detection. We observe that precise localization requires careful placement of each side of the bounding box. However, the mainstream approach, which focuses on predicting centers and sizes, is not the most effective way to accomplish this task, especially when there exists displacements with large variance between the anchors and the targets. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, named as Side-Aware Boundary Localization (SABL), where each side of the bounding box is respectively localized with a dedicated network branch. To tackle the difficulty of precise localization in the presence of displacements with large variance, we further propose a two-step localization scheme, which first predicts a range of movement through bucket prediction and then pinpoints the precise position within the predicted bucket. We test the proposed method on both two-stage and single-stage detection frameworks. Replacing the standard bounding box regression branch with the proposed design leads to significant improvements on Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and Cascade R-CNN, by 3.0%, 1.7%, and 0.9%, respectively.

Although currently, several existing methods \u201cflatten\"\" such 3D images to use planar graph / hypergraph matching methods, they still suffer from severe distortions and other undesired artifacts, which result in inaccurate matching. Alternatively, current planar methods cannot be trivially extended to effectively match points on images warped onto manifolds. Hence, matching on these warped images persists as a formidable challenge. In this paper, we pose the assignment problem as finding a bijective map between two graph induced simplicial complexes, which are higher-order analogues of graphs. We propose a constrained quadratic assignment problem (QAP) that matches each p-skeleton of the simplicial complexes, iterating from the highest to the lowest dimension. The accuracy and robustness of our approach are illustrated on both synthetic and real-world spherical / warped (projected) images with known ground-truth correspondences.

Specifically, the proposed LAM adaptively emphasizes hierarchical features by considering correlations among layers. Meanwhile, CSAM learns the confidence at all the positions of each channel to selectively capture more informative features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HAN performs favorably against the state-of-the-art single image super-resolution approaches.\"",

Existing one-shot method, however, is hard to train and not yet effective on large scale datasets like ImageNet. This work propose a Single Path One-Shot model to address the challenge in the training. Our central idea is to construct a simplified supernet, where all architectures are single paths so that weight co-adaption problem is alleviated. Training is performed by uniform path sampling. All architectures (and their weights) are trained fully and equally. Comprehensive experiments verify that our approach is flexible and effective. It is easy to train and fast to search. It effortlessly supports complex search spaces (e.g., building blocks, channel, mixed-precision quantization) and different search constraints (e.g., FLOPs, latency). It is thus convenient to use for various needs. It achieves start-of-the-art performance on the large dataset ImageNet.\"",

Our method relies on data-driven priors learned by a deep network specifically designed to imbibe weakly supervised constraints from the interplay of the unknown camera with 3D entities such as object heights, through estimation of bounding box projections. We leverage categorical priors for objects such as humans or cars that commonly occur in natural images, as references for scale estimation.

In this paper, we propose a surprisingly effective enhancement to local feature extraction, which improves matching. We show that CNN-based depths inferred from single RGB images, are quite helpful, despite their flaws.

        "abstract": "Single-stage instance segmentation approaches have recently gained popularity due to their speed and simplicity, but are still lagging behind in accuracy, compared to two-stage methods. We propose a fast single-stage instance segmentation method, called SipMask, that preserves instance-specific spatial information by separating mask prediction of an instance to different sub-regions of a detected bounding-box. Our main contribution is a novel light-weight spatial preservation (SP) module that generates a separate set of spatial coefficients for each sub-region within a bounding-box, leading to improved mask predictions. It also enables accurate delineation of spatially adjacent instances. Further, we introduce a mask alignment weighting loss and a feature alignment scheme to better correlate mask prediction with object detection. On COCO $ exttt{test-dev}$, our SipMask outperforms the existing single-stage methods. Compared to the state-of-the-art single-stage TensorMask, SipMask obtains an absolute gain of 1.0% (mask AP), while providing a four-fold speedup. In terms of real-time capabilities, SipMask outperforms YOLACT with an absolute gain of 3.0% (mask AP) under similar settings, while operating at comparable speed on a Titan Xp. We also evaluate our SipMask for real-time video instance segmentation, achieving promising results on YouTube-VIS dataset.

        "abstract": "We introduce a novel problem of localizing all the instances of an object (seen or unseen during training) in a natural image via sketch query. We refer to this problem as sketch-guided object localization. This problem is distinctively different from the traditional sketch-based image retrieval task where the gallery set often contains images with only one object. The sketch-guided object localization proves to be more challenging when we consider the following: (i) the sketches used as queries are abstract representations with little information on the shape and salient attributes of the object, (ii) the sketches have significant variability as they are hand-drawn by a diverse set of untrained human subjects, and (iii) there exists a domain gap between sketch queries and target natural images as these are sampled from very different data distributions. To address the problem of sketch-guided object localization, we propose a novel mph{cross-modal attention} scheme that guides the region proposal network (RPN) to generate object proposals relevant to the sketch query. These object proposals are later scored against the query to obtain final localization. Our method is effective with as little as a single sketch query. Moreover, it also generalizes well to object categories not seen during training and is effective in localizing multiple object instances present in the image. Furthermore, we extend our framework to a multi-query setting using novel feature fusion and attention fusion strategies introduced in this paper. The localization performance is evaluated on publicly available object detection benchmarks, viz. MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC, with sketch queries obtained from `Quick, Draw!'. The proposed method significantly outperforms related baselines on both single-query and multi-query localization tasks.\"",

        "abstract": "Scene graph aims to faithfully reveal humans' perception of image content. When humans analyze a scene, they usually prefer to describe image gist first, namely major objects and key relations in a scene graph. This humans' inherent perceptive habit implies that there exists a hierarchical structure about humans' preference during the scene parsing procedure. Therefore, we argue that a desirable scene graph should be also hierarchically constructed, and introduce a new scheme for modeling scene graph. Concretely, a scene is represented by a human-mimetic Hierarchical Entity Tree (HET) consisting of a series of image regions. To generate a scene graph based on HET, we parse HET with a Hybrid Long Short-Term Memory (Hybrid-LSTM) which specifically encodes hierarchy and siblings context to capture the structured information embedded in HET. To further prioritize key relations in the scene graph, we devise a Relation Ranking Module (RRM) to dynamically adjust their rankings by learning to capture humans' subjective perceptive habits from objective entity saliency and size. Experiments indicate that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performances for scene graph generation, but also is expert in mining image-specific relations which play a great role in serving downstream tasks. \"",

To achieve this, we formulate the detection problem from the anchor point's perspective and identify ineffective training as the main problem. Our key insight is that anchor points should be optimized jointly as a group both within and across feature pyramid levels. We propose a simple yet effective training strategy with soft-weighted anchor points and soft-selected pyramid levels to address the false attention issue within each pyramid level and the feature selection issue across all the pyramid levels, respectively. To evaluate the effectiveness, we train a single-stage anchor-free detector called Soft Anchor-Point Detector (SAPD). Experiments show that our concise SAPD pushes the envelope of speed/accuracy trade-off to a new level, outperforming recent state-of-the-art anchor-free and anchor-based detectors. Without bells and whistles, our best model can achieve a single-model single-scale AP of 47.4% on COCO. \"",

Nevertheless, their unorganized nature - points are stored in an unordered way - makes them less suited to be processed by deep learning pipelines. In this paper, we propose a method for 3D object completion and classification based on point clouds. We introduce a new way of organizing the extracted features based on their activations, which we name soft pooling. For the decoder stage, we propose regional convolutions, a novel operator aimed at maximizing the global activation entropy. Furthermore, inspired by the local refining procedure in Point Completion Network (PCN), we also propose a patch-deforming operation to simulate deconvolutional operations for point clouds. This paper proves that our regional activation can be incorporated in many point cloud architectures like AtlasNet and PCN, leading to better performance for geometric completion. We evaluate our approach on different 3D tasks such as object completion and classification, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.\"",

        "abstract": "Long-tail recognition tackles the natural non-uniformly distributed data in real-world scenarios. While modern classifiers perform well on populated classes, its performance degrades significantly on tail classes. Humans, however, are less affected by this since, when confronted with uncertain examples, they simply opt to provide coarser predictions. Motivated by this, a deep realistic taxonomic classifier (Deep-RTC) is proposed as a new solution to the long-tail problem, combining realism with hierarchical predictions. The model has the option to reject classifying samples at different levels of the taxonomy, once it cannot guarantee the desired performance. Deep-RTC is implemented with a stochastic tree sampling during training to simulate all possible classification conditions at finer or coarser levels and a rejection mechanism at inference time. Experiments on the long-tailed version of four datasets, CIFAR100, AWA2, Imagenet, and iNaturalist, demonstrate that the proposed approach preserves more information on all classes with different popularity levels. Deep-RTC also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in longtailed recognition, hierarchical classification, and learning with rejection literature using the proposed correctly predicted bits (CPB) metric.\"",

Conventional methods solve this problem via iterative (alternating) minimization by leveraging some prior knowledge about the structure of the unknown image. The inherent ambiguities about shift and flip in the Fourier measurements make this problem especially difficult; and most of the existing methods use several random restarts with different permutations. In this paper, we assume that a known (learned) reference is added to the signal before capturing the Fourier amplitude measurements. Our method is inspired by the principle of adding a reference signal in holography. To recover the signal, we implement an iterative phase retrieval method as an unrolled network. Then we use back propagation to learn the reference that provides us the best reconstruction for a fixed number of phase retrieval iterations. We performed a number of simulations on a variety of datasets under different conditions and found that our proposed method for phase retrieval via unrolled network and learned reference provides near-perfect recovery at fixed (small) computational cost. We compared our method with standard Fourier phase retrieval methods and observed significant performance enhancement using the learned reference.\"",

Fortunately it is a coupled problem: the pose can be found easily given the correspondences and vice versa. Existing approaches assume that noisy correspondences are provided, that a good pose prior is available, or that the problem size is small. We instead propose the first fully end-to-end trainable network for solving the blind PnP problem efficiently and globally, that is, without the need for pose priors.

In this paper, we study this problem in the context of audio-conditioned visual synthesis -- a task that is important, for example, in occlusion reasoning. Specifically, our goal is to generate future video frames and their motion dynamics conditioned on audio and a few past frames. To tackle this problem, we present Sound2Sight, a deep variational framework, that is trained to learn a per frame stochastic prior conditioned on a joint embedding of audio and past frames. This embedding is learned via a multi-head attention-based audio-visual transformer encoder. The learned prior is then sampled to further condition a video forecasting module to generate future frames. The stochastic prior allows the model to sample multiple plausible futures that are consistent with the provided audio and the past context. Moreover, to improve the quality and coherence of the generated frames, we propose a multimodal discriminator that differentiates between a synthesized and a real audio-visual clip. We empirically evaluate our approach, vis-\\'a-vis closely-related prior methods, on two new datasets viz. (i) Multimodal Stochastic Moving MNIST with a Surprise Obstacle, (ii) Youtube Paintings; as well as on the existing Audio-Set Drums dataset. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Sound2Sight significantly outperforms the state of the art in the generated video quality, while also producing diverse video content.\"",

        "abstract": "This work studies the sparse adversarial attack, which aims to generate adversarial perturbations onto partial positions of one benign image, such that the perturbed image is incorrectly predicted by one deep neural network (DNN) model. The sparse adversarial attack involves two challenges, i.e., where to perturb, and how to determine the perturbation magnitude. Many existing works determined the perturbed positions manually or heuristically, and then optimized the magnitude using a proper algorithm designed for the dense adversarial attack. In this work, we propose to factorize the perturbation at each pixel to the product of two variables, including the perturbation magnitude and one binary selection factor (i.e., 0 or 1). One pixel is perturbed if its selection factor is 1, otherwise not perturbed. Based on this factorization, we formulate the sparse attack problem as a mixed integer programming (MIP) to jointly optimize the binary selection factors and continuous perturbation magnitudes of all pixels, with a cardinality constraint on selection factors to explicitly control the degree of sparsity. Besides, the perturbation factorization provides the extra flexibility to incorporate other meaningful constraints on selection factors or magnitudes to achieve some desired performance, such as the group-wise sparsity or the enhanced visual imperceptibility. We develop an efficient algorithm by equivalently reformulating the MIP problem as a continuous optimization problem. Experiments on benchmark databases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over several state-of-the-art sparse attack methods. \"",

In this work, we approach this problem by addressing two issues that have been under-researched in the open literature: sampling strategy (data term) and graph construction (prior term). First, instead of the popular random sampling strategy, we suggest that Poisson disk sampling is a much more effective solution to create sparse depth map from a dense version. We experimentally compare a class of quasi-random sampling strategies and demonstrate that an optimized sampling strategy can significantly improve the performance of depth completion for the same number of sparse samples. Second, instead of the traditional square kernel, we suggest that dynamic construction of local neighborhood is a better choice for interpolating the missing values. More specifically, we proposed an end-to-end network with a graph convolution module. Since the neighborhood relationship of 3D points is more effectively exploited by our novel graph convolution module, our approach has achieved not only state-of-the-art results for depth completion of indoor scenes but also better generalization ability than other competing methods. \"",

In this paper, we propose a Spatial Hierarchy Aware Residual Pyramid Network, called SHARP-Net, to remove the depth noise by fully exploiting the geometry information of the scene on different scales. SHARP-Net first introduces a Residual Regression Module, which utilizes the depth images and amplitude images as the input, to calculate the depth residual progressively. Then, a Residual Fusion Module, summing over depth residuals from all scales, is imported to fuse multi-scale geometry information. Finally, shot noise is further eliminated by a Kernel Prediction Network.

Specifically, spatial and angular features are first separately extracted from input LFs, and then repetitively interacted to progressively incorporate spatial and angular information. Finally, the interacted features are fused to superresolve each sub-aperture image. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of LF-InterNet over the state-of-the-art methods, i.e., our method can achieve high PSNR and SSIM scores with low computational cost, and recover faithful details in the reconstructed images.\"",

        "abstract": "In the feature maps of CNNs, there commonly exists considerable spatial redundancy that leads to much repetitive processing. Towards reducing this superfluous computation, we propose to compute features only at sparsely sampled locations, which are probabilistically chosen according to activation responses, and then densely reconstruct the feature map with an efficient interpolation procedure. With this sampling-interpolation scheme, our network avoids expending computation on spatial locations that can be effectively interpolated, while being robust to activation prediction errors through broadly distributed sampling. A technical challenge of this sampling-based approach is that the binary decision variables for representing discrete sampling locations are non-differentiable, making them incompatible with backpropagation. To circumvent this issue, we make use of a reparameterization trick based on the Gumbel-Softmax distribution, with which backpropagation can iterate these variables towards binary values. The presented network is experimentally shown to save substantial computation while maintaining accuracy over a variety of computer vision tasks.\"",

To develop this assistive technology, we study the TextVQA task, i.e., reasoning about text in images to answer a question. Existing approaches are limited in their use of spatial relations and rely on fully-connected transformer-like architectures to implicitly learn the spatial structure of a scene. In contrast, we propose a novel spatially aware self-attention layer such that each visual entity only looks at neighboring entities defined by a spatial graph. Further, each head in our multi-head self-attention layer focuses on a different subset of relations. Our approach has two advantages: (1) each head considers local context instead of dispersing the attention amongst all visual entities; (2) we avoid learning redundant features. We show that our model improves the absolute accuracy of current state-of-the-art methods on TextVQA by 2.2% overall over an improved baseline, and 4.62% on questions that involve spatial reasoning and can be answered correctly using OCR tokens. Similarly on ST-VQA, we improve the absolute accuracy by 4.2%. We further show that spatially aware self-attention improves visual grounding.\"",

In this work, we take the first step to study adversarial attacks for embodied agents. In particular, we generate spatiotemporal perturbations to form 3D adversarial examples, which exploit the interaction history in both the temporal and spatial dimensions. Regarding the temporal dimension, since agents make predictions based on historical observations, we develop a trajectory attention module to explore scene view contributions, which further help localize 3D objects appeared with highest stimuli. By conciliating with clues from the temporal dimension, along the spatial dimension, we adversarially perturb the physical properties (e.g., texture and 3D shape) of the contextual objects that appeared in the most important scene views. Extensive experiments on the EQA-v1 dataset for several embodied tasks in both the white-box and black-box settings have been conducted, which demonstrate that our perturbations have strong attack and generalization abilities.\"",

Moreover, the methods should also be adaptable to any unknown faces and speech quickly during inference. Current state-of-the-art methods fail to generate realistic animation from any speech on unknown faces due to their poor gen-eralization over different facial characteristics, languages, and accents. Some of these failures can be attributed to the end-to-end learning of the complex relationship between the multiple modalities of speech and the video. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy where we partition the problem and learn the motion and texture separately. Firstly, we train a GAN network to learn the lip motion in a canonical landmark using DeepSpeech features and induce eye-blinks before transferring the motion to the person-specific face. Next, we use another GAN based texture generator network to generate high fidelity face corresponding to the motion on person-specific landmark. We use meta-learning to make the texture generator GAN more flexible to adapt to the unknown subject\u2019s traits of the face during inference. Our method gives significantly improved facial animation than the state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well across the different datasets, different languages, and accents,and also works reliably well in presence of noises in the speech.\"",

This work proposes a novel spherical feature transform approach. It relaxes the assumption of identical covariance between classes to an assumption of similar covariances of different classes on a hypersphere. Consequently, the feature transform is performed by a rotation that respects the spherical data distributions.

Since the pixel-level annotation is not available in the training process, we rely on region mining models to estimate the pseudo-masks from the image-level labels. Thus, in order to improve the final segmentation results, we aim to train a region-mining model which could accurately and completely highlight the target object regions for generating high-quality pseudo-masks. However, the region mining models are likely to only highlight the most discriminative regions instead of the entire objects. In this paper, we aim to tackle this problem from a novel perspective of optimization process. We propose a Splitting vs. Merging optimization strategy, which is mainly composed of the Discrepancy loss and the Intersection loss. The proposed Discrepancy loss aims at mining out regions of di\ufb00erent spatial patterns instead of only the most discriminative region, which leads to the splitting e\ufb00ect. The Intersection loss aims at mining the common regions of the di\ufb00erent maps, which leads to the merging e\ufb00ect. Our Splitting vs. Merging strategy helps to expand the output heatmap of the region mining model to the object scale. Finally, by training the segmentation model with the masks generated by our Splitting vs Merging strategy, we achieve the state-of-the-art weakly-supervised segmentation results on the Pascal VOC 2012 benchmark.\"",

        "abstract": "LiDAR point-cloud segmentation is an important problem for many applications. For large-scale point cloud segmentation, the extit{de facto} method is to project a 3D point cloud to get a 2D LiDAR image and use convolutions to process it. Despite the similarity between regular RGB and LiDAR images, we are the first to discover that the feature distribution of LiDAR images changes drastically at different image locations. Using standard convolutions to process such LiDAR images is problematic, as convolution filters pick up local features that are only active in specific regions in the image. As a result, the capacity of the network is under-utilized and the segmentation performance decreases. To fix this, we propose Spatially-Adaptive Convolution (SAC) to adopt different filters for different locations according to the input image. SAC can be computed efficiently since it can be implemented as a series of element-wise multiplications, im2col, and standard convolution. It is a general framework such that several previous methods can be seen as special cases of SAC. Using SAC, we build SqueezeSegV3 for LiDAR point-cloud segmentation and outperform all previous published methods by at least 2.0\\% mIoU on the SemanticKITTI benchmark.

        "abstract": "Most state-of-the-art deep neural networks are overparameterized and exhibit a high computational cost. A straightforward approach to this problem is to replace convolutional kernels with its low-rank tensor approximations, whereas the Canonical Polyadic tensor Decomposition is one of the most suited models. However, fitting the convolutional tensors by numerical optimization algorithms often encounters diverging components, i.e., extremely large rank-one tensors but canceling each other. Such degeneracy often causes the non-interpretable result and numerical instability for the neural network \ufb01ne-tuning. This paper is the first study on degeneracy in the tensor decomposition of convolutional kernels. We present a novel method, which can stabilize the low-rank approximation of convolutional kernels and ensure efficient compression while preserving the high-quality performance of the neural networks. We evaluate our approach on popular CNN architectures for image classification and show that our method results in much lower accuracy degradation and provides consistent performance.\"",

However, the number of stacking levels is a hyper-parameter fine-tuned manually, making the stacking levels static during training without theoretical explanations for optimal settings. To address this challenge, we leverage the iterative process of the traditional plug-and-play method to provide a dynamic stacked network for Image Restoration. Specifically, a new degradation model with a novel update scheme is designed to integrate the deep neural network as the prior within the plug-and-play model. Compared with static stacked networks, our models are stacked dynamically during training via iterations, guided by a solid mathematical explanation. Theoretical proof on the convergence of the dynamic stacking process is provided. Experiments on the noise dataset BSD68, Set12, and motion blur dataset GoPro demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of PSNR and SSIM score without extra training process.\"",

In this paper, we present a new framework that retrieves dense 3D measurements of the fluid velocity field using a pair of event-based cameras. First, we track particles inside the two event sequences in order to estimate their 2D velocity in the two sequences of images. A stereo-matching step is then performed to retrieve their 3D positions. These intermediate outputs are incorporated into an optimization framework that also includes physically plausible regularizers, in order to retrieve the 3D velocity field.

When the problem is scaled up, this step is neither efficient in computation nor manageable for a single compute node. In this work, we propose a stochastic bundle adjustment algorithm which seeks to decompose the RCS approximately inside the LM iterations to improve the efficiency and scalability. It first reformulates the quadratic programming problem of an LM iteration based on the clustering of the visibility graph by introducing the equality constraints across clusters. Then, we propose to relax it into a chance constrained problem and solve it through sampled convex program. The relaxation is intended to eliminate the interdependence between clusters embodied by the constraints, so that a large RCS can be decomposed into independent linear sub-problems. Numerical experiments on unordered Internet image sets and sequential SLAM image sets, as well as distributed experiments on large-scale datasets, have demonstrated the high efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach.\"",

We present an analysis, in the frequency domain, of degradation-kernel overfitting in super-resolution and introduce a conditional learning perspective that extends to both super-resolution and denoising. Building on our formulation, we propose a stochastic frequency masking of images used in training to regularize the networks and address the overfitting problem.

        "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles operate in a dynamic environment, where the speed with which a vehicle can perceive and react impacts the safety and efficacy of the system. LiDAR provides a central and prominent sensory modality that informs many existing perceptual systems including object detection, segmentation, motion estimation and action recognition. The latency for perceptual system based on point cloud data can be dominated by the amount of time for a complete rotational scan (e.g. 100 ms). This built-in data capture latency is artificial, and based on treating the point cloud as a camera image in order to leverage camera-inspired architectures. However, unlike CCD camera sensors, most LiDAR point cloud data is natively a {\\it streaming} data source in which laser reflections are sequentially recorded based on the rotational angle of the laser beam. In this work, we explore how to build an object detector that removes this artificial latency constraint, and instead operates on native streaming data in order to significantly reduce latency. This approach has the added benefit of reducing the peak computational burden on inference hardware by spreading the computation over the complete scan sequence. We demonstrate a family of streaming detection systems based on sequential modeling through a series of modifications to the traditional object detection meta-architecture. We highlight how this model may achieve competitive if not superior predictive performance with state-of-the-art, traditional non-streaming detection systems while achieving significant latency gains (e.g. 1/15'th - 1/3'rd of peak latency). Our results show that operating on LiDAR data in its native streaming formulation offers several advantages for self driving object detection -- advantages that we hope will be useful for any LiDAR perception system where minimizing latency is critical for safe and efficient operation.\"",

Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) could leverage structure information to learn structure representations. However, adopting GCNs to tackle such continuous action sequences both in spatial and temporal space is challenging as the action graph could be huge. To overcome this challenge, we propose a variant of GCNs to leverage the self-attention mechanism to prune a complete action graph in the temporal space.

Gestures that are naturally timed with corresponding speech during human communication are called co-speech gestures. A key challenge, called gesture style transfer, is to learn a model that generates these gestures for a speaking agent 'A' in the gesturing style of a target speaker 'B'. A secondary goal is to simultaneously learn to generate co-speech gestures for multiple speakers while remembering what is unique about each speaker. We call this challenge style preservation. In this paper, we propose a new model, named Mix-StAGE, which trains a single model for multiple speakers while learning unique style embeddings for each speaker's gestures in an end-to-end manner. A novelty of Mix-StAGE is to learn a mixture of generative models which allows for conditioning on the unique gesture style of each speaker. As Mix-StAGE disentangles style and content of gestures, gesturing styles for the same input speech can be altered by simply switching the style embeddings. Mix-StAGE also allows for style preservation when learning simultaneously from multiple speakers. We also introduce a new dataset, Pose-Audio-Transcript-Style (PATS), designed to study gesture generation and style transfer. Our proposed Mix-StAGE model significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach for gesture generation and provides a path towards performing gesture style transfer across multiple speakers.

However, these methods are susceptible to the massive label noise in the training data and thus require laborious human effort to clean the datasets. In this paper, we relax the intra-class constraint of ArcFace to improve the robustness to label noise. More specifically, we design $K$ sub-centers for each class and the training sample only needs to be close to any of the $K$ positive sub-centers instead of the only one positive center. The proposed sub-center ArcFace encourages one dominant sub-class that contains the majority of clean faces and non-dominant sub-classes that include hard or noisy faces. Extensive experiments confirm the robustness of sub-center ArcFace under massive real-world noise. After the model achieves enough discriminative power, we directly drop non-dominant sub-centers and high-confident noisy samples, which helps recapture intra-compactness, decrease the influence from noise, and achieve comparable performance compared to ArcFace trained on the manually cleaned dataset. By taking advantage of the large-scale raw web faces (Celeb500K), sub-center Arcface achieves state-of-the-art performance on IJB-B, IJB-C, MegaFace, and FRVT.\"",

State-of-the-art approaches for video summarization have mostly regarded the task as a frame-wise keyframe selection problem by aggregating all frames with equal weight. However, to find informative parts of the video, it is necessary to consider how all the frames of the video are related to each other. To this end, we cast video summarization as a graph modeling problem. We propose recursive graph modeling networks for video summarization, termed SumGraph, to represent a relation graph, where frames are regarded as nodes and nodes are connected by semantic relationships among frames. Our networks accomplish this through a recursive approach to refine an initially estimated graph to correctly classify each node as a keyframe by reasoning the graph representation via graph convolutional networks. To leverage SumGraph in a more practical environment, we also present a way to adapt our graph modeling in an unsupervised fashion. With SumGraph, we achieved state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks for video summarization in both supervised and unsupervised manners.\"",

The edge attention module utilizes attention mechanism to highlight object and suppress background noise, and a supervised branch is devised to guide the network to focus on the edge of instances precisely.

In this work, we propose a simple gated network (GateNet) to solve both issues at once. With the help of multilevel gate units, the valuable context information from the encoder can be optimally transmitted to the decoder. We design a novel gated dual branch structure to build the cooperation among different levels of features and improve the discriminability of the whole network. Through the dual branch design, more details of the saliency map can be further restored. In addition, we adopt the atrous spatial pyramid pooling based on the proposed \u201cFold\u201d operation (Fold-ASPP) to accurately localize salient objects of various scales.

To suppressing the impact of mislabeled data, this paper proposes a conceptually simple yet efficient training block, termed as Attentive Feature Mixup (AFM), which allows paying more attention to clean samples and less to mislabeled ones via sample interactions in small groups. Specifically, this plug-and-play AFM first leverages a group-to-attend module to construct groups and assign attention weights for group-wise samples, and then uses a mixup module with the attention weights to interpolate massive noisy-suppressed samples. The AFM has several appealing benefits for noise-robust deep learning. (i) It does not rely on any assumptions and extra clean subset. (ii) With massive interpolations, the ratio of useless samples is reduced dramatically compared to the original noisy ratio. (iii) It jointly optimizes the interpolation weights with classifiers, suppressing the influence of mislabeled data via low attention weights. (iv) It partially inherits the vicinal risk minimization of mixup to alleviate over-fitting while improves it by sampling fewer feature-target vectors around mislabeled data from the mixup vicinal distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AFM yields state-of-the-art results on two challenging real-world noisy datasets: Food101N and Clothing1M. \"",

Tilted images are of particular interest as more visual data are captured by arbitrarily oriented sensors such as body-/robot-mounted cameras. Existing approaches exhibit bounded performance on predicting surface normals because they were trained using gravity-aligned images. Our two main hypotheses are: (1) visual scene layout is indicative of the gravity direction; and (2) not all surfaces are equally represented by a learned estimator due to the structured distribution of the training data, i.e., there exists a transformation for each tilted image that is more responsive to the learned estimator than others. We design a spatial rectifier that is learned to transform the surface normal distribution of a tilted image to the rectified one that matches the gravity-aligned training data distribution. Along with the spatial rectifier, we propose a novel truncated angular loss that offers a stronger gradient at small angular errors and robustness to outliers. The resulting estimator outperforms the state-of-the-art methods including data augmentation baselines not only on ScanNet and NYUv2 but also on a new dataset called Tilt-RGBD that includes considerable roll and pitch camera motion.\"",

However, the task itself is quite challenging because there is a huge modality gap between images and physical descriptions of attributes. Often, there may also be a large number of unseen categories (attribute combinations). The current state-of-the-art methods either focus on learning better cross-modal embeddings by mining only seen data, or they explicitly use generative adversarial networks (GANs) to synthesize unseen features. The former tends to produce poor embeddings due to insufficient data, while the latter does not preserve intra-class compactness during generation. In this paper, we present a symbiotic adversarial learning framework, called SAL. Two GANs sit at the base of the framework in a symbiotic learning scheme: one synthesizes features of unseen classes/categories, while the other optimizes the embedding and performs the cross-modal alignment on the common embedding space. Specifically, two different types of generative adversarial networks learn collaboratively throughout the training process and the interactions between the two mutually benefit each other.

Generally, research on 3D face generation revolves around linear statistical models of the facial surface. Nevertheless, these models cannot represent faithfully either the facial texture or the normals of the face, which are very crucial for photo-realistic face synthesis. Recently, it was demonstrated that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be used for generating high-quality textures of faces. Nevertheless, the generation process either omits the geometry and normals, or independent processes are used to produce 3D shape information. In this paper, we present the first methodology that generates high-quality texture, shape, and normals jointly, which can be used for photo-realistic synthesis. To do so, we propose a novel GAN that can generate data from different modalities while exploiting their correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate how we can condition the generation on the expression and create faces with various facial expressions. The qualitative results shown in this paper is compressed due to size limitations, full-resolution results and the accompanying video that can be found in the supplementary materials.\"",

        "abstract": "Solving depth estimation with monocular cameras enables the possibility of widespread use of cameras as low-cost depth estimation sensors in applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. In order to learn such a scalable depth estimation model, we require a ton of data and labels which are targeted towards specific use-cases. Acquiring these labels is expensive and often requires a calibrated research platform to collect data, which can be unfeasible especially in situations where the terrain is unknown. There are two popular approaches that do not require annotated depth maps:(i) using labelled synthetic and unlabeled real data in an adversarial framework to predict more accurate depth, and (ii) unsupervised models which exploit geometric structure across space and time in monocular video frames. Ideally, we would like to leverage features provided by both approaches as they complement each other; however, existing methods do not adequately exploit these additive benefits. We present a self-supervised framework which combines these complementary features: We use synthetic as well as real images for training while exploiting geometric and temporal constraints. Our novel consolidated architecture performs better than existing state-of-the-art literature. We present a unique way to train this self-supervised framework, and achieve over 15% improvement over the previous supervised approaches with domain adaption and 10% over the previous self-supervised approaches.\"",

        "abstract": "The field of Few-Shot Learning (FSL), or learning from very few (typically $1$ or $5$) examples per novel class (unseen during training), has received a lot of attention and significant performance advances in the recent literature. While number of techniques have been proposed for FSL, several factors have emerged as most important for FSL performance, awarding SOTA even to the simplest of techniques. These are: the backbone architecture (bigger is better), type of pre-training on the base classes (meta-training vs regular multi-class, currently regular wins), quantity and diversity of the base classes set (the more the merrier, resulting in richer and better adaptive features), and the use of self-supervised tasks during pre-training (serving as a proxy for increasing the diversity of the base set). In this paper we propose yet another simple technique that is important for the few shot learning performance - a search for a compact feature sub-space that is discriminative for a given few-shot test task. We show that the Task-Adaptive Feature Sub-Space Learning (TAFSSL) can significantly boost the performance in FSL scenarios when some additional unlabeled data accompanies the novel few-shot task, be it either the set of unlabeled queries (transductive FSL) or some additional set of unlabeled data samples (semi-supervised FSL). Specifically, we show that on the challenging extit{mini}ImageNet and extit{tiered}ImageNet benchmarks, TAFSSL can improve the current state-of-the-art in both transductive and semi-supervised FSL settings by more than $5\\%$, while increasing the benefit of using unlabeled data in FSL to above $10\\%$ performance gain.\"",

        "abstract": "For many years, multi-object tracking benchmarks have focused on a handful of categories. Motivated primarily by surveillance and self-driving applications, these datasets provide tracks for people, vehicles, and animals, ignoring the vast majority of objects in the world. By contrast, in the related field of object detection, the introduction of large-scale, diverse datasets (e.g., COCO) have fostered significant progress in developing highly robust solutions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a similarly diverse dataset for Tracking Any Object (TAO). It consists of 2,907 high resolution videos, captured in diverse environments, which are half a minute long on average. Importantly, we adopt a bottom-up approach for discovering a large vocabulary of 833 categories, an order of magnitude more than prior tracking benchmarks. To this end, we ask annotators to label objects that move at any point in the video, and give names to them post factum. Our vocabulary is both significantly larger and qualitatively different from existing tracking datasets. To ensure scalability of annotation, we employ a federated approach that focuses manual effort on labeling tracks for those relevant objects in a video (e.g., those that move). We perform an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art trackers and make a number of important discoveries regarding large-vocabulary tracking in an open-world. In particular, we show that existing single- and multi-object trackers struggle when applied to this scenario in the wild, and that detection-based, multi-object trackers are in fact competitive with user-initialized ones. We hope that our dataset and analysis will boost further progress in the tracking community.\"",

Specifically, by maximizing TC-induced loss (namely TC gain) over classifiers of all modalities, these classifiers can cooperatively discover the equivalent class of ground-truth classifiers; and identify the unique ones by leveraging a limited percentage of labeled data. We apply our method and can achieve state-of-the-art results on various datasets, including the Newsgroup dataset, Emotion recognition (IEMOCAP and MOSI) and Medical Imaging (Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative).",

These excitation mechanisms are designed following the spirit of curriculum learning and aim to reduce learning ambiguities at the beginning of training by selectively exciting feature activations using ground truth. Then we gradually reduce the weight of ground truth excitations by a curriculum rate and replace it by a curriculum complementary map for better and faster convergence. In particular, the spatial excitation strengthens feature activations for clear object boundaries, while the temporal excitation imposes motions to emphasize spatio-temporal salient regions. Spatial and temporal excitations can combat the saliency shifting problem and conflict between spatial and temporal features of VSOD. Furthermore, our semi-curriculum learning design enables the first online refinement strategy for VSOD, which allows exciting and boosting saliency responses during testing without re-training. The proposed triple excitations can easily plug in different VSOD methods. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of all three excitation methods and the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art image and video salient object detection methods.\"",

For the operation-level, we present a bi-sampling search algorithm to moderate the operation collapse. For the depth-level, we introduce a sink-connecting search space to ensure the mutual exclusion between skip and other candidate operations, as well as eliminate the architecture redundancy. For the width-level, we propose an elasticity-scaling strategy that achieves precise latency constraint in a progressively fine-grained manner. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of TF-NAS. Particularly, our searched TF-NAS-A obtains 76.9% top-1 accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art results with less latency.

TP-LSD has two branches: tri-points extraction branch and line segmentation branch. The former predicts the heat map of root-points and the two displacement maps of endpoints. The latter segments the pixels on straight lines out from background. Moreover, the line segmentation map is reused in the first branch as structural prior.

However, studies on the imperfect data especially with missing values are still far from success and challenging, even though such an issue is ubiquitous in the real world. Although previous works show the promising performance by exploiting the low-rank structures of the fused features, only the first-order statistics of the temporal dynamics are concerned. To this end, we propose a novel network architecture termed Time Product Fusion Network (TPFN), which takes the high-order statistics over both modalities and temporal dynamics into account. We construct the fused features by the outer product along adjacent time-steps, such that richer modal and temporal interactions are utilized. In addition, we claim that the low-rank structures can be obtained by regularizing the Frobenius norm of latent factors instead of the fused features. Experiments on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets show that TPFN can compete with state-of-the art approaches in multimodal sentiment analysis in cases of both random and structured missing values.\"",

In this work we propose to make use of this knowledge and leverage it for computing the distributions of the weights of the DNN. This can be further used for estimating the epistemic uncertainty of the DNN by aggregating predictions from an ensemble of networks sampled from these distributions. To this end we introduce a method for tracking the trajectory of the weights during optimization, that does neither require any change in the architecture, nor in the training procedure.

We unearth the importance of normalization layers, and provide a carefully designed two-stream generative model with newly proposed feature transformations in a coarse-to-fine fashion. This allows multi-scale semantic structure information and style representation to be effectively captured and fused by the network, permitting our method to scale to various tasks in both unsupervised and supervised settings. No additional constraints (e.g., cycle consistency) are needed, contributing to a very clean and simple method. Multi-modal image synthesis with arbitrary style control is made possible.

However, these methods fail to generalize well because of the absence of meta-features or errors made by the OCR when there is a significant variance in table layouts and text organization.

Given the motion on each joint in the pose at each time step extracted from 3D pose sequences, we hierarchically pool these joint motions in a bottom-up manner in the encoder, following the kinematic chains in the human body. We also constrain the latent embeddings of the encoder to contain the space of psychologically-motivated affective features underlying the gaits. We train the decoder to reconstruct the motions per joint per time step in a top-down manner from the latent embeddings. For the annotated data, we also train a classifier to map the latent embeddings to emotion labels. Our semi-supervised approach achieves a mean average precision of 0.84 on the Emotion-Gait benchmark dataset, which contains both labeled and unlabeled gaits collected from multiple sources. We outperform current state-of-art algorithms for both emotion recognition and action recognition from 3D gaits by 7%-23% on the absolute.

To overcome the limitations, we propose a 3D-aware generative network along with a hybrid embedding module and a non-linear composition module. Through modeling the head motion and facial expressions explicitly, manipulating 3D animation carefully, and embedding reference images dynamically, our approach achieves controllable, photorealistic, and temporally coherent talking-head videos with natural head movements.

In this paper, we propose a novel method, dubbed deep hashing targeted attack (DHTA), to study the targeted attack on such retrieval. Specifically, we first formulate the targeted attack as a point-to-set optimization, which minimizes the average distance between the hash code of an adversarial example and those of a set of objects with the target label. Then we design a novel component-voting scheme to obtain an anchor code as the representative of the set of hash codes of objects with the target label, whose optimality guarantee is also theoretically derived. To balance the performance and perceptibility, we propose to minimize the Hamming distance between the hash code of the adversarial example and the anchor code under the $ll^\\infty$ restriction on the perturbation. Extensive experiments verify that DHTA is effective in attacking both deep hashing based image retrieval and video retrieval.\"",

The main challenge to realize this idea is that there exist non-differentiable components in the encoder such as run-length encoding and Huffman coding and it is not straightforward to predict the probability distribution of the quantized image representations. We address these issues by learning a differentiable loss function that approximates bitrates using simple network blocks---two MLPs and an LSTM. We evaluate the proposed algorithm using multiple task-specific losses---two for semantic image understanding and another two for conventional image compression---and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to the individual tasks. \"",

Despite its broad application and interest, it remains a challenging problem in part due to the vast range of conditions under which it must be robust. Pedestrian detection at nighttime and during adverse weather conditions is particularly challenging, which is one of the reasons why thermal and multispectral approaches have been become popular in recent years. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to domain adaptation that significantly improves pedestrian detection performance in the thermal domain. The key idea behind our technique is to adapt an RGB-trained detection network to simultaneously solve two related tasks. An auxiliary classification task that distinguishes between daytime and nighttime thermal images is added to the main detection task during domain adaptation. The internal representation learned to perform this classification task is used to condition a YOLOv3 detector at multiple points in order to improve its adaptation to the thermal domain. We validate the effectiveness of task-conditioned domain adaptation by comparing with the state-of-the-art on the KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Detection Benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed task-conditioned approach achieves the best single-modality detection results.\"",

To distill the temporal coherence part of video representation from frame representations, we propose a simple yet effective Adversarial Feature Augmentation (AFA) method, which highlights the temporal coherence features by introducing adversarial augmented temporal motion noise. Specifically, we disentangle the video representation into the temporal coherence and motion parts and randomly change the scale of the temporal motion features as the adversarial noise. The proposed AFA method is a general lightweight component that can be readily incorporated into various methods with negligible cost.

Firstly, we introduce a Temporal Saliency Erasing (TSE) module including a saliency erasing operation and a series of ordered learners. Specifically, for a specific frame of a video, the saliency erasing operation drives the specific learner to mine new and complementary parts by erasing the parts activated by previous frames. Such that the diverse visual features can be discovered for consecutive frames and finally form an integral characteristic of the target identity. Furthermore, a Temporal Saliency Boosting (TSB) module is designed to propagate the salient information among video frames to enhance the salient feature. It is complementary to TSE by effectively alleviating the information loss caused by the erasing operation of TSE. Extensive experiments show our method performs favorably against state-of-the-arts.

In this paper, we attempt to tackle this issue through two ways. 1) Design a sequential channel filtering mechanism, Progressive Enhancement Module (PEM), to excite the discriminative channels of features from different frames step by step, and thus avoid repeated information extraction. 2) Create a Temporal Diversity Loss (TD Loss) to force the kernels to concentrate on and capture the variations among frames rather than the image regions with similar appearance. Our method is evaluated on the temporal reasoning datasets Something-Something V1 and V2, and it achieves visible improvements against the best competitor by 2.4% and 1.3%. Besides, performance improvements over the 2D-CNN-based state-of-the-arts on the large-scale dataset Kinetics are also witnessed.\"",

        "abstract": "Multi-person pose estimation and tracking in realistic videos is very challenging due to factors such as occlusions, fast motion and pose variations. Top-down approaches are commonly used for this task, which involves three stages: person detection, single-person pose estimation, and pose association across time. Recently, significant progress has been made in person detection and single-person pose estimation. In this paper, we mainly focus on improving pose association and estimation in a video to build a strong pose estimator and tracker. To this end, we propose a novel temporal keypoint matching and refinement network. Specifically, we propose two network modules, temporal keypoint matching and temporal keypoint refinement, which are incorporated into a single-person pose estimatin network. The temporal keypoint matching module learns a simialrity metric for matching keypoints across frames. Pose matching is performed by aggregating keypoint similarities between poses in adjacent frames. The temporal keypoint refinement module serves to correct individual poses by utilizing their associated poses in neighboring frames as temporal context. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed network on two benchmark datasets: PoseTrack 2017 and PoseTrack 2018. Exprimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.\"",

        "abstract": "Context information plays an indispensable role in the success of semantic segmentation. Recently, non-local self-attention based methods are proved to be effective for context information collection. Since desired context consists of spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions, the 3D representation is an appropriate formulation. However, these non-local methods describe 3D context information based on a 2D similarity matrix, where space compression may lead to channel-wise attention missing. An alternative is to model the contextual information directly without compression. However, this effort confronts a fundamental difficulty, namely the high-rank property of context information. In this paper, we propose a new approach to model the 3D context representations,which not only avoids the space compression, but also tackles the high-rank difficulty. Here, inspired by tensor canonical-polyadic decomposition theory (i.e, a high-rank tensor can be expressed as a combination of rank-1 tensors.), we design a low-rank-to-high-rank con-text reconstruction framework (i.e., RecoNet). Specifically, we first introduce the tensor generation module (TGM), which generates a number of rank-1 tensors to capture fragments of context feature. Then we use these rank-1 tensors to recover the high-rank context features through our proposed tensor reconstruction module (TRM). Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art on various public datasets. Additionally, our proposed method has more than 100 times less computational cost compared with conventional non-local-based methods.\"",

On the other hand, reference-based SR (Ref-SR) methods can transfer textures to some extent, but is still impractical to handle very large factors and keep fidelity with original input. To solve these problems, we propose an efficient high-resolution hallucination network for very large scaling factors with efficient network structure and feature transferring. To transfer more detailed textures, we design a wavelet texture loss, which helps to enhance more high-frequency components. At the same time, to reduce the smoothing effect brought by the image reconstruction loss, we further relax the reconstruction constraint with a degradation loss which ensures the consistency between downscaled super-resolution results and low-resolution inputs. We also collected a high-resolution (g 4K resolution) painting dataset PaintHD by considering both physical size and image resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with extensive experiments on PaintHD by comparing with SISR and Ref-SR state-of-the-art methods.\"",

We define the AMKS by decomposing the spectral contributions of the kernel into several bands, allowing us to limit the influence of noise-dominated high-frequency components and obtain a more descriptive signature. We also show through a perturbation theory analysis of the kernel that choosing a finite stopping time $T$ leads to noise and deformation robustness for the AMKS.

We show that our method automatically uncovers meaningful factors of variation in the standard basis when applied to ProgressiveGAN across several datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate that our regularization term can be used to identify interpretable directions in BigGAN's latent space in a fully unsupervised fashion. Finally, we provide provide empirical evidence that our regularization term encourages sparsity when applied to overparameterized latent spaces.\"",

To solve model-fitting problems for HoloLens 2 hand tracking, where the computational budget is approximately 100 times smaller than an iPhone 7, we introduce a new surface model: the `Phong surface'. Using ideas from computer graphics, the Phong surface describes the same 3D shape as a triangulated mesh model, but with continuous surface normals which enable the use of lifting-based optimization, providing significant efficiency gains over ICP-based methods.

We find that mining forgery patterns with the awareness of frequency could be a cure, as frequency provides a complementary viewpoint where either subtle forgery artifacts or compression errors could be well described. To introduce frequency into the face forgery detection, we propose a novel Frequency in Face Forgery Network (F$^3$-Net), taking advantages of two different but complementary frequency-aware clues, 1) frequency-aware decomposed image components, and 2) local frequency statistics, to deeply mine the forgery patterns via our two-stream collaborative learning framework. We apply DCT as the applied frequency-domain transformation. Through comprehensive studies, we show that the proposed F$^3$-Net significantly outperforms competing state-of-the-art methods on all compression qualities in the challenging FaceForensics++ dataset, especially wins a big lead upon low-quality media.\"",

The CNN is usually trained by minimizing pixel-wise losses, which is less than ideal to produce binary masks that preserve the road network's global connectivity. To address this issue, we introduce an Adversarial Learning (AL) strategy tailored for our purposes. A naive one would treat the segmentation network as a generator and would feed its output along with ground-truth segmentations to a discriminator. It would then train the generator and discriminator jointly. We will show that this is not enough because it does not capture the fact that most errors are local and need to be treated as such. Instead, we use a more sophisticated discriminator that returns a label pyramid describing what portions of the road network are correct at several different scales. This discriminator and the structured labels it returns are what gives our approach its edge and we will show that it outperforms state-of-the-art ones on the challenging RoadTracer dataset.\"",

In this paper, we propose a novel GAN model that learns the topology of real images, i.e., connectedness and loopy-ness. In particular, we introduce a new loss that bridges the gap between synthetic image distribution and real image distribution in the topological feature space. By optimizing this loss, the generator produces images with the same structural topology as real images.

In this paper, the classic framework is re-designed to enable 4D reconstruction of dynamic scene under topology changes, by introducing a novel structure of Non-manifold Volumetric Grid to the re-design of both TSDF and EDG, which allows connectivity updates by cell splitting and replication. Experiments show convincing reconstruction results for dynamic scenes of topology changes, as compared to the state-of-the-art methods.\"",

On this basis, we propose a novel topology-preserving class-incremental learning (TPCIL) framework. TPCIL uses an elastic Hebbian graph (EHG) to model the feature space topology, which is constructed with the competitive Hebbian learning rule. To maintain the topology, we develop the topology-preserving loss (TPL) that penalizes the changes of EHG's neighborhood relationships during incremental learning phases. Comprehensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet, and subImageNet datasets demonstrate the power of the TPCIL for continuously learning new classes with less forgetting. The code will be released.\"",

        "abstract": "Bilinear pooling has achieved an impressive improvement in many computer vision tasks. Recent studies discover that matrix normalization is vital for improving the performance of bilinear pooling. Nevertheless, traditional matrix square-root or logarithm normalization methods need singular value decomposition (SVD), which is not well suited in the GPU platform, limiting its efficiency in training and inference. To boost the efficiency in the GPU platform, recent methods rely on Newton-Schulz (NS) iteration to approximate the matrix square-root. Despite NS iteration is GPU-friendly, it takes several times matrix-matrix multiplications, which is still expensive in computation. Besides, the proposed RUN is much simpler than NS iteration and thus much easier for implementation in practice. Meanwhile, NS iteration can not well support the compact bilinear feature obtained from tensor sketch or random projection. To overcome these limitations, we propose a rank-1 update normalization (RUN), which only needs matrix-vector multiplications and thus is significantly more efficient than NS iteration using matrix-matrix multiplications. Moreover, our RUN readily supports the normalization on compact bilinear features, making it more flexible to be deployed compared with NS iteration. The proposed RUN is differentiable and can be plugged in a neural network for an end-to-end training. Comprehensive experiments on four public benchmarks show that, for the full bilinear pooling, the proposed RUN achieves comparable accuracies with a $330 imes$ speedup over NS iteration. For the compact bilinear pooling, our RUN achieves comparable accuracies with a $5400 imes$ speedup over SVD-based normalization.\"",

We improve and extend both aspects. First, we systematically yield enhanced receptive fields for complementary feature extraction via coarse-to-fine decomposition of input imagery along the spatial and temporal dimensions, and adaptively focus on training important feature pathways using a reparameterized fully connected layer. Second, we develop a `use when needed' scheme with a `coarse-exit' strategy that allows selective use of expensive high-resolution processing in a data-dependent fashion to retain accuracy while reducing computation cost. Our C2F learning approach builds ensemble networks that outperform most competing methods in terms of both reduced computation cost and improved accuracy on the Something-Something V1, V2, and Jester datasets, while also remaining competitive on the Kinetics-400 dataset. Uniquely, our C2F ensemble networks can operate at varying computation budget constraints.\"",

Achieving high accuracy typically requires labeled data from test users which may not be attainable in real applications. We observe that there exists a strong relationship between what users are looking at and the appearance of the user\u2019s eyes. In response to this understanding, we propose a novel dataset and accompanying method which aims to explicitly learn these semantic and temporal relationships. Our video dataset consists of time-synchronized screen recordings, user-facing camera views, and eye gaze data, which allows for new benchmarks in temporal gaze tracking as well as label-free refinement of gaze. Importantly, we demonstrate that the fusion of information from visual stimuli as well as eye images can lead towards achieving performance similar to literature-reported figures acquired through supervised personalization. Our final method yields significant performance improvements on our proposed EVE dataset, with up to 28% improvement in Point-of-Gaze estimates (resulting in 2.49-deg in angular error), paving the path towards high-accuracy screen-based eye tracking purely from webcam sensors.

MoVi-3D builds upon a novel approach which leverages geometrical information to generate, both at training and test time, virtual views where the object appearance is normalized with respect to distance. These virtually generated views facilitate the detection task as they significantly reduce the visual appearance variability associated to objects placed at different distances from the camera. As a consequence, the deep model is relieved from learning depth-specific representations and its complexity can be significantly reduced.

        "abstract": "Modern multiple object tracking (MOT) systems usually follow the tracking-by-detection paradigm. It has 1) a detection model for target localization and 2) an appearance embedding model for data association. Having the two models separately executed might lead to efficiency problems, as the running time is simply a sum of the two steps without investigating potential structures that can be shared between them. Existing research efforts on real-time MOT usually focus on the association step, so they are essentially real-time association methods but not real-time MOT system. In this paper, we propose an MOT system that allows target detection and appearance embedding to be learned in a shared model. Specifically, we incorporate the appearance embedding model into a single-shot detector, such that the model can simultaneously output detections and the corresponding embeddings. We further propose a simple and fast association method that works in conjunction with the joint model. In both components the computation cost is significantly reduced compared with former MOT systems, resulting in a neat and fast baseline for future follow-ups on real-time MOT algorithm design. To our knowledge, this work reports the first (near) real-time MOT system, with a running speed of 22 to 40 FPS depending on the input resolution. Meanwhile, its tracking accuracy is comparable to the state-of-the-art trackers embodying separate detection and embedding (SDE) learning ($64.4\\%$ MOTA s $66.1\\%$ MOTA on MOT-16 challenge).

        "abstract": "Embodied perception refers to the ability of an autonomous agent to perceive its environment so that it can (re)act. The responsiveness of the agent is largely governed by latency of its processing pipeline. While past work has studied the algorithmic trade-off between latency and accuracy, there has not been a clear metric to compare different methods along the Pareto optimal latency-accuracy curve. We point out a discrepancy between standard offline evaluation and real-time applications: by the time an algorithm finishes processing a particular image frame, the surrounding world has changed. To these ends, we present an approach that coherently integrates latency and accuracy into a single metric for real-time online perception, which we refer to as \"\"streaming accuracy\"\". The key insight behind this metric is to jointly evaluate the output of the entire perception stack at every time instant, forcing the stack to consider the amount of streaming data that should be ignored while computation is occurring. More broadly, building upon this metric, we introduce a meta-benchmark that systematically converts any image understanding task into a streaming perception task. We focus on the illustrative tasks of object detection and instance segmentation in urban video streams, and contribute a novel dataset with high-quality and temporally-dense annotations. Our proposed solutions and their empirical analysis demonstrate a number of surprising conclusions: (1) there exists an optimal \"\"sweet spot\"\" that maximizes streaming accuracy along the Pareto optimal latency-accuracy curve, (2) asynchronous tracking and future forecasting naturally emerge as internal representations that enable streaming image understanding, and (3) dynamic scheduling can be used to overcome temporal aliasing, yielding the paradoxical result that latency is sometimes minimized by sitting idle and \"\"doing nothing\"\".\"",

Furthermore, these systems may even misrepresent the image in order to produce a simpler caption consisting of common concepts.

We find that modern captioning systems return higher likelihoods for incorrect distractor sentences compared to ground truth captions, and that evaluation metrics like SPICE can be 'topped' using simple captioning systems relying on object detectors. Inspired by these observations, we design a new metric (SPICE-U) by introducing a notion of uniqueness over the concepts generated in a caption. We show that SPICE-U is better correlated with human judgements compared to SPICE, and effectively captures notions of diversity and descriptiveness. Finally, we also demonstrate a general technique to improve any existing captioning model -- by using mutual information as a re-ranking objective during decoding. Empirically, this results in more unique and informative captions, and improves three different state-of-the-art models on SPICE-U as well as average score over existing metrics.\"",

        "abstract": "Measuring algorithmic bias is crucial both to assess algorithmic fairness, and to guide the improvement of algorithms. Current bias measurement methods in computer vision are based on observational datasets, and conflate algorithmic bias with dataset bias. To address this problem we develop an experimental method for measuring algorithmic bias of face analysis algorithms, which directly manipulates the attributes of interest, e.g., gender and skin tone, in order to reveal causal links between attribute variation and performance change. Our method is based on generating synthetic image grids that differ along specific attributes while leaving other attributes constant. A crucial aspect of our approach is relying on the perception of human observers, both to guide manipulations, and to measure algorithmic bias. We validate our method by comparing it to a traditional observational bias analysis study in gender classification algorithms. The two methods reach different conclusions. While the observational method reports gender and skin color biases, the experimental method reveals biases due to gender, hair length, age, and facial hair. We also show that our synthetic transects allow for more straightforward bias analysis on minority and intersectional groups.\"",

        "abstract": "with Neural 3D Mapping\",\"We hypothesize that an agent that can look around in static scenes can learn rich visual representations applicable to 3D object tracking in complex dynamic scenes. We are motivated in this pursuit by the fact that the physical world itself is mostly static, and multiview correspondence labels are relatively cheap to collect in static scenes, e.g., by triangulation. We propose to leverage multiview data of static points in arbitrary scenes (static or dynamic), to learn a neural 3D mapping module which produces features that are correspondable across time. The neural 3D mapper consumes RGB-D data as input, and produces a 3D voxel grid of deep features as output. We train the voxel features to be correspondable across viewpoints, using a contrastive loss, and correspondability across time emerges automatically. At test time, given an RGB-D video with approximate camera poses, and given the 3D box of an object to track, we track the target object by generating a map of each timestep and locating the object's features within each map. In contrast to models that represent video streams in 2D or 2.5D, our model's 3D scene representation is disentangled from projection artifacts, is stable under camera motion, and is robust to partial occlusions. We test the proposed architectures in challenging simulated and real data, and show that our unsupervised 3D object trackers outperform prior unsupervised 2D and 2.5D trackers, and approach the accuracy of supervised trackers. This work demonstrates that 3D object trackers can emerge without tracking labels, through multiview self-supervision on static data. \"",

Our tracker, CenterTrack, applies a detection model to a pair of images and detections from the prior frame. Given this minimal input, CenterTrack localizes objects and predicts their associations with the previous frame. That's it. CenterTrack is simple, online (no peeking into the future), and real-time. It achieves $67.3\\%$ MOTA on the MOT17 challenge at 17 FPS and $89.4\\%$ MOTA on the KITTI tracking benchmark at 12 FPS, setting a new state of the art on both datasets. CenterTrack is easily extended to monocular 3D tracking by regressing additional 3D attributes.

Our dataset has the following two advantages over the existing ones, which would facilitate practical research for causality analysis. First, the decomposition of an accident into cause and effect events provides atomic cues for reasoning on a complex environment and planning future actions. Second, the prediction of cause and effect in an accident makes a system more interpretable to humans, which mitigates the ambiguity of legal liabilities among agents engaged in the accident.

        "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully used in a range of tasks. However, CNNs are often viewed as \"\"black-box\"\" and lack of interpretability. One main reason is due to the filter-class entanglement -- an intricate many-to-many correspondence between filters and classes. Most existing works attempt post-hoc interpretation on a pre-trained model, while neglecting to reduce the entanglement underlying the model. In contrast, we focus on alleviating filter-class entanglement during training. Inspired by cellular differentiation, we propose a novel strategy to train interpretable CNNs by encouraging class-specific filters, among which each filter responds to only one (or few) class. Concretely, we design a learnable sparse Class-Specific Gate (CSG) structure to assign each filter with one (or few) class in a flexible way. The gate allows a filter's activation to pass only when the input samples come from the specific class. Extensive experiments demonstrate the fabulous performance of our method in generating a sparse and highly class-related representation of the input, which leads to stronger interpretability. Moreover, comparing with the standard training strategy, our model displays benefits in applications like object localization and adversarial sample detection.

Towards this end, we present Trajectron++, a modular, graph-structured recurrent model that forecasts the trajectories of a general number of diverse agents while incorporating agent dynamics and heterogeneous data (e.g., semantic maps). Trajectron++ is designed to be tightly integrated with robotic planning and control frameworks; for example, it can produce predictions that are optionally conditioned on ego-agent motion plans.

However, most of these method have been limited to classification and segmentation applications. We propose Transformation Consistency Regularization, which delves into a more challenging setting of image-to-image translation, which remains unexplored by semi-supervised algorithms. The method introduces a diverse set of geometric transformations and enforces the model's predictions for unlabeled data to be invariant to those transformations. We evaluate the efficacy of our algorithm on three different applications: image colorization, denoising and super-resolution. Our method is significantly data efficient, requiring only around 10-20% of labeled samples to achieve similar image reconstructions to its fully-supervised counterpart. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of our method in video processing applications, where knowledge from a few frames can be leveraged to enhance the quality of the rest of the movie. \"",

        "abstract": "For large-scale vision tasks in biomedical images, the labeled data is often limited to train effective deep models. Active learning is a common solution, where a query suggestion method selects representative unlabeled samples for annotation, and the new labels are used to improve the base model. However, most query suggestion models optimize their learnable parameters only on the limited labeled data and consequently become less effective for the more challenging unlabeled data. To tackle this, we propose a two-stream active query suggestion approach. In addition to the supervised feature extractor, we introduce an unsupervised one optimized on all raw images to capture diverse image features, which can later be improved by fine-tuning on new labels. As a use case, we build an end-to-end active learning framework with our query suggestion method for 3D synapse detection and mitochondria segmentation in connectomics. With the framework, we curate, to our best knowledge, the largest connectomics dataset with dense synapses and mitochondria annotation. On this new dataset, our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 3.1% for synapse and 3.8% for mitochondria in terms of region-of-interest proposal accuracy. We also apply our method to image classification, where it outperforms previous approaches on CIFAR-10 under the same limited annotation budget.

        "abstract": "Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (W-TAL) aims to classify and localize all action instances in an untrimmed video under only video-level supervision. However, without frame-level annotations, it is challenging for W-TAL methods to identify false positive action proposals and generate action proposals with precise temporal boundaries. In this paper, we present a Two-Stream Consensus Network (TSCN) to simultaneously address these challenges. The proposed TSCN features an iterative refinement training method, where a frame-level pseudo ground truth is iteratively updated, and used to provide frame-level supervision for improved model training and false positive action proposal elimination. Furthermore, we propose a new attention normalization loss to encourage the predicted attention to act like a binary selection, and promote the precise localization of action instance boundaries. Experiments conducted on the THUMOS14 and ActivityNet datasets show that the proposed TSCN outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, and even achieves comparable results with some recent fully-supervised methods.\"",

        "abstract": "The current spike of hyper-realistic faces artificially generated using deepfakes calls for media forensics solutions that are tailored to video streams and work reliably with a low false alarm rate at the video level. We present a method for deepfake detection based on a two-branch network structure that isolates digitally manipulated faces by learning to amplify artifacts while suppressing the high-level face content. Unlike current methods that extract spatial frequencies as a preprocessing step, we propose a two-branch structure: one branch propagates the original information, while the other branch suppresses the face content yet amplifies multi-band frequencies using a Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) as a bottleneck layer. To better isolate manipulated faces, we derive a novel cost function that, unlike regular classification, compresses the variability of natural faces and pushes away the unrealistic facial samples in the feature space. Our two novel components show promising results on the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and Facebook's DFDC preview benchmarks, when compared to prior work. We then offer a full, detailed ablation study of our network architecture and cost function. Finally, although the bar is still high to get very remarkable figures at a very low false alarm rate, our study shows that we can achieve good video-level performance when cross-testing in terms of video-level AUC.\"",

        "abstract": "Recently, deep self-training approaches emerged as a powerful solution to the unsupervised domain adaptation. The self-training scheme involves iterative processing of target data; it generates target pseudo labels and retrains the network. However, since only the confident predictions are taken as pseudo labels, existing self-training approaches inevitably produce sparse pseudo labels in practice. We see this is critical because the resulting insufficient training-signals lead to a sub-optimal, error-prone model. In order to tackle this problem, we propose a novel Two-phase Pseudo Label Densification framework, referred to as TPLD. In the first phase, we use sliding window voting to propagate the confident predictions, utilizing inherent spatial-correlations in the images. In the second phase, we perform a confidence-based easy-hard classification. For the easy samples, we now employ their full pseudo-labels. For the hard ones, we instead adopt adversarial learning to enforce hard-to-easy feature alignment. To ease the training process and avoid noisy predictions, we introduce the bootstrapping mechanism to the original self-training loss. We show the proposed TPLD can be integrated into any type of existing self-training based approaches and improve the performance significantly. Combined with the recently proposed CRST self-training framework, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on two standard UDA benchmarks.\"",

In this paper, we present UFO$^2$, a unified object detection framework that can handle different forms of supervision simultaneously. Specifically, UFO$^2$ incorporates strong supervision (e.g., boxes), various forms of partial supervision (e.g., class tags, points, and scribbles), and unlabeled data. Through rigorous evaluations, we demonstrate that each form of label can be utilized to either train a model from scratch or to further improve a pre-trained model. We also use UFO$^2$ to investigate budget-aware omni-supervised learning, i.e., various annotation policies are studied under a fixed annotation budget: we show that competitive performance needs no strong labels for all data. Finally, we demonstrate the generalization of UFO$^2$, detecting more than 1,000 different objects without bounding box annotations.

In this paper, we introduce UNITER, a UNiversal Image-TExt Representation, learned through large-scale pre-training over four image-text datasets (COCO, Visual Genome, Conceptual Captions, and SBU Captions), which can power heterogeneous downstream V+L tasks with joint multimodal embeddings. We design four pre-training tasks: Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Region Modeling (MRM, with three variants), Image-Text Matching (ITM), and Word-Region Alignment (WRA). Different from previous work that applies joint random masking to both modalities, we use conditional masking on pre-training tasks (i.e., masked language/region modeling is conditioned on full observation of image/text). In addition to ITM for global image-text alignment, we also propose WRA via the use of Optimal Transport (OT) to explicitly encourage fine-grained alignment between words and image regions during pre-training. Comprehensive analysis shows that both conditional masking and OT-based WRA contribute to better pre-training. We also conduct a thorough ablation study to find an optimal combination of pre-training tasks. Extensive experiments show that UNITER achieves new state of the art across six V+L tasks (over nine datasets), including Visual Question Answering, Image-Text Retrieval, Referring Expression Comprehension, Visual Commonsense Reasoning, Visual Entailment, and NLVR$^2$.\"",

Inspired by human perception, the recognition of lanes under severe occlusion and extreme lighting conditions is mainly based on contextual and global information. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel, simple, yet effective formulation aiming at extremely fast speed and challenging scenarios. Specifically, we treat the process of lane detection as a row-based selecting problem using global features. With the help of row-based selecting, our formulation could significantly reduce the computational cost. Using a large receptive field on global features, we could also handle the challenging scenarios. Moreover, based on the formulation, we also propose a structural loss to explicitly model the structure of lanes. Extensive experiments on two lane detection benchmark datasets show that our method could achieve the state-of-the-art performance in terms of both speed and accuracy. A light weight version could even achieve 300+ frames per second with the same resolution, which is at least 4x faster than previous state-of-the-art methods.

While image saliency modeling is a well-studied problem and progress on benchmarks like SALICON and MIT300 is slowing, video saliency models have shown rapid gains on the recent DHF1K benchmark. Here, we take a step back and ask: Can image and video saliency modeling be approached via a unified model, with mutual benefit? We identify different sources of domain shift between image and video saliency data and between different video saliency datasets as a key challenge for effective joint modelling. To address this we propose four novel domain adaptation techniques - Domain-Adaptive Priors, Domain-Adaptive Fusion, Domain-Adaptive Smoothing and Bypass-RNN - in addition to an improved formulation of learned Gaussian priors. We integrate these techniques into a simple and lightweight encoder-RNN-decoder-style network, UNISAL, and train it jointly with image and video saliency data. We evaluate our method on the video saliency datasets DHF1K, Hollywood-2 and UCF-Sports, and the image saliency datasets SALICON and MIT300. With one set of parameters, UNISAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on all video saliency datasets and is on par with the state-of-the-art for image saliency datasets, despite faster runtime and a 5 to 20-fold smaller model size compared to all competing deep methods.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in deep neural networks have achieved significant progress in detecting individual objects from an image. However, object detection is not sufficient to fully understand a visual scene. Towards a deeper visual understanding, the interactions between objects, especially humans and objects are essential. Most prior works have obtained this information with a bottom-up approach, where the objects are first detected and the interactions are predicted sequentially by pairing the objects. This is a major bottleneck in HOI detection inference time. To tackle this problem, we propose UnionDet, a one-stage meta-architecture for HOI detection powered by a novel union-level detector that eliminates this additional inference stage by directly capturing the region of interaction. Our first, fastest and best performing one-stage detector for human-object interaction shows a significant reduction in interaction prediction time ($4 imes \\sim 14 imes$) while outperforming state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets: V-COCO and HICO-DET.\"",

In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial-consistency loss for image-to-image translation.

        "abstract": "We investigate the task of learning blind image denoising networks from an unpaired set of clean and noisy images. Such problem setting generally is practical and valuable considering that it is feasible to collect unpaired noisy and clean images in most real-world applications. And we further assume that the noise can be signal dependent but is spatially uncorrelated. In order to facilitate unpaired learning of denoising network, this paper presents a two-stage scheme by incorporating self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation. For self-supervised learning, we suggest a dilated blind-spot network (D-BSN) to learn denoising solely from real noisy images. Due to the spatial independence of noise, we adopt a network by stacking $1 imes1$ convolution layers to estimate the noise level map for each image. Both the D-BSN and image-specific noise model ($ ext{CNN}_{ ext{est}}$) can be jointly trained via maximizing the constrained log-likelihood. Given the output of D-BSN and estimated noise level map, improved denoising performance can be further obtained based on the Bayes' rule. As for knowledge distillation, we first apply the learned noise models to clean images to synthesize a paired set of training images, and use the real noisy images and the corresponding denoising results in the first stage to form another paired set. Then, the ultimate denoising model can be distilled by training an existing denoising network using these two paired sets. Experiments show that our unpaired learning method performs favorably on both synthetic noisy images and real-world noisy photographs in terms of quantitative and qualitative evaluation.

To address this issue, we introduce unselfie, a novel photographic transformation that automatically translates a selfie into a neutral-pose portrait. To achieve this, we first collect an unpaired dataset, and introduce a way to synthesize paired training data for self-supervised learning. Then, to unselfie a photo, we propose a new three-stage pipeline, where we first find a target neutral pose, inpaint the body texture, and finally refine and composite the person on the background. To obtain a suitable target neutral pose, we propose a novel nearest pose search module that makes the reposing task easier and enables the generation of multiple neural-pose results among which users can choose the best one they like.

In this work, we propose a novel Siamese denoising autoencoder to learn a 3D pose representation by disentangling the pose-dependent and view-dependent feature from the human skeleton data, in a fully unsupervised manner. These two disentangled features are utilized together as the representation of the 3D pose. To consider both the kinematic and geometric dependencies, a sequential bidirectional recursive network (SeBiReNet) is further proposed to model the human skeleton data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the learned representation 1) preserves the intrinsic information of human pose, 2) shows good transferability across datasets and tasks. Notably, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two inherently different tasks: pose denoising and unsupervised action recognition.

We adopt a novel neural representation of multi-person 3D pose which unifies the position of person instances with their corresponding 3D pose representation. This is realized by learning a generative pose embedding which not only ensures plausible 3D pose predictions, but also eliminates the usual keypoint grouping operation as employed in prior bottom-up approaches. Further, we propose a practical deployment paradigm where paired 2D or 3D pose annotations are unavailable. In the absence of any paired supervision, we leverage a frozen network, as a teacher model, which is trained on an auxiliary task of multi-person 2D pose estimation. We cast the learning as a cross-modal alignment problem and propose training objectives to realize a shared latent space between two diverse modalities. We aim to enhance the model's ability to perform beyond the limiting teacher network by enriching the latent-to-3D pose mapping using artificially synthesized multi-person 3D scene samples. Our approach not only generalizes to in-the-wild images, but also yields a superior trade-off between speed and performance, compared to prior top-down approaches. Our approach also yields state-of-the-art multi-person 3D pose estimation performance among the bottom-up approaches under consistent supervision levels.\"",

        "abstract": "Existing approaches for unsupervised metric learning focus on exploring self-supervision information within the input image itself. We observe that, when analyzing images, human eyes often compare images against each other instead of examining images individually. In addition, they often pay attention to certain keypoints, image regions, or objects which are discriminative between image classes but highly consistent within classes. Even if the image is being transformed, the attention pattern will be consistent. Motivated by this observation, we develop a new approach to unsupervised deep metric learning where the network is learned based on self-supervision information across images instead of within one single image. To characterize the consistent pattern of human attention during image comparisons, we introduce the idea of transformed attention consistency. It assumes that visually similar images, even undergoing different image transforms, should share the same consistent visual attention map. This consistency leads to a pairwise self-supervision loss, allowing us to learn a Siamese deep neural network to encode and compare images against their transformed or matched pairs. To further enhance the inter-class discriminative power of the feature generated by this network, we adapt the concept of triplet loss from supervised metric learning to our unsupervised case and introduce the contrastive clustering loss. Our extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised metric learning by a large margin.\"",

        "abstract": "Segmentation of the pixels corresponding to human skin is an essential first step in multiple applications ranging from surveillance to heart-rate estimation from remote-photoplethysmography. However, the existing literature considers the problem only in the visible-range of the EM-spectrum which limits their utility in low or no light settings where the criticality of the application is higher. To alleviate this problem, we consider the problem of skin segmentation from the Near-infrared images. However, Deep learning based state-of-the-art segmentation techniques demands large amounts of labelled data that is unavailable for the current problem. Therefore we cast the skin segmentation problem as that of target-independent Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) where we use the data from the Red-channel of the visible-range to develop skin segmentation algorithm on NIR images. We propose a method for target-independent segmentation where the 'nearest-clone' of a target image in the source domain is searched and used as a proxy in the segmentation network trained only on the source domain. We prove the existence of 'nearest-clone' and propose a method to find it through an optimization algorithm over the latent space of a Deep generative model based on variational inference. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method for NIR skin segmentation over the state-of-the-art UDA segmentation methods on the two newly created skin segmentation datasets in NIR domain despite not having access to the target NIR data. Additionally, we report state-of-the-art results for adaption from Synthia to Cityscapes which is a popular setting in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for semantic segmentation.

        "abstract": "Person re-identification (ReID) remains a challenging task in many real-word video analytics and surveillance applications, even though state-of-the-art accuracy has improved considerably with the advent of deep learning (DL) models trained on large image datasets. Given the shift in distributions that typically occurs between video data captured from the source and target domains, and absence of labeled data from the target domain, it is difficult to adapt a DL model for accurate recognition of target data. DL models for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) are commonly designed in the feature representation space. We argue that for pair-wise matchers that rely on metric learning, e.g., Siamese networks for person ReID, the UDA objective should consist in aligning pair-wise dissimilarity between domains, rather than aligning feature representations. Moreover, dissimilarity representations are more suitable for designing open-set ReID systems, where identities differ in the source and target domains. In this paper, we propose a novel Dissimilarity-based Maximum Mean Discrepancy (D-MMD) loss for aligning pair-wise distances that can be optimized via gradient descent using relatively small batch sizes. From a person ReID perspective, the evaluation of D-MMD loss is straightforward since the tracklet information (provided by a person tracker) allows to label a distance vector as being either within-class (within-tracklet) or between-class (between-tracklet). This allows approximating the underlying distribution of target pair-wise distances for D-MMD loss optimization, and accordingly align source and target distance distributions. Empirical results with three challenging benchmark datasets show that the proposed D-MMD loss decreases as source and domain distributions become more similar. Extensive experimental evaluation also indicates that UDA methods that rely on the D-MMD loss can significantly outperform baseline and state-of-the-art UDA methods for person ReID. The dissimilarity space transformation allows to design reliable pair-wise matchers, without the common requirement for data augmentation and/or complex networks.

To depress noises in pseudo-labels, this paper proposes a Noise Resistible Mutual-Training (NRMT) method, which maintains two networks during training to perform collaborative clustering and mutual instance selection. On one hand, collaborative clustering eases the fitting to noisy instances by allowing the two networks to use pseudo-labels provided by each other as an additional supervision. On the other hand, mutual instance selection further selects reliable and informative instances for training according to the peer-confidence and relationship disagreement of the networks.

        "abstract": "Automatic discovery of category-specific 3D keypoints from a collection of objects of a category is a challenging problem. The difficulty is added when objects are represented by 3D point clouds, with variations in shape and semantic parts and unknown coordinate frames. We define keypoints to be category-specific, if they meaningfully represent objects\u2019 shape and their correspondences can be simply established order-wise across all objects. This paper aims at learning such 3D keypoints, in an unsupervised manner, using a collection of misaligned 3D point clouds of objects from an unknown category. In order to do so, we model shapes defined by the keypoints, within a category, using the symmetric linear basis shapes without assuming the plane of symmetry to be known. The usage of symmetry prior leads us to learn stable keypoints suitable for higher misalignments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on learning such keypoints directly from 3D point clouds for a general category. Using objects from four benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the quality of our learned keypoints by quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our experiments also show that the keypoints discovered by our method are geometrically and semantically consistent.\"",

The census transform, instead of image pixel values, is often used for the image similarity. In this work, rather than the handcrafted features i.e. census or pixel values, we propose to use deep self-supervised features with a novel similarity measure, which fuses multi-layer similarities. With the fused similarity, our network better learns flow by minimizing our proposed feature separation loss. The proposed method is a polarizing scheme, resulting in a more discriminative similarity map. In the process, the features are also updated to get high similarity for matching pairs and low for uncertain pairs, given estimated flow.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we look into the problem of estimating per-pixel depth maps from unconstrained RGB monocular night-time images which is a difficult task that has not been addressed adequately in the literature. The state-of-the-art day-time depth estimation methods fail miserably when tested with night-time images due to a large domain shift between them. The usual photometric losses used for training these networks may not work for night-time images due to the absence of uniform lighting which is commonly present in day-time images, making it a difficult problem to solve. We propose to solve this problem by posing it as a domain adaptation problem where a network trained with day-time images is adapted to work for night-time images. Specifically, an encoder is trained to generate features from night-time images that are indistinguishable from those obtained from day-time images by using a PatchGAN-based adversarial discriminative learning method. Unlike the existing methods that directly adapt depth prediction (network output), we propose to adapt feature maps obtained from the encoder network so that a pre-trained day-time depth decoder can be directly used for predicting depth from these adapted features. Hence, the resulting method is termed as \u201cAdversarial Domain Feature Adaptation (ADFA)\u201d and its efficacy is demonstrated through experimentation on the challenging Oxford night driving dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this work is a first of its kind to estimate depth from unconstrained night-time monocular RGB images that uses a completely unsupervised learning process. The modular encoder-decoder architecture for the proposed ADFA method allows us to use the encoder module as a feature extractor which can be used in many other applications. One such application is demonstrated where the features obtained from our adapted encoder network are shown to outperform other state-of-the-art methods in a visual place recognition problem, thereby, further establishing the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.\"",

Our unsupervised multi-view CNN branches off two channels which encode the knowledge within each 2D view and the 3D object respectively and also exploits both intra-view and inter-view knowledge of the object. It ends with a new loss layer which formulates the view-object consistency by impelling the two channels to generate consistent classification outcomes. We evaluate our method both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating its superiority over several state-of-the-art methods.

Existing works only deal with either style difference or spatial deformation alone, synthesizing photos from edge-aligned line drawings or transforming shapes within the same modality, e.g., color images. Our insight is to decompose the unsupervised sketch to photo synthesis task into two stages of translation: First shape translation from sketches to grayscale photos and then content enrichment from grayscale to color photos. We also incorporate a self-supervised denoising objective and an attention module to handle abstraction and style variations that are specific to sketches. Our synthesis is sketch-faithful and photo-realistic, enabling sketch-based image retrieval and automatic sketch generation that captures human visual perception beyond the edge map of a photo.\"",

Video eye gaze estimation methods aim to tackle a related task but salient spots in those methods are not bounded by objects and tend to produce very scattered, unstable predictions due to the noisy ground truth data. We reformulate the problem of detecting and tracking of salient object spots as a new task called object hotspot tracking. In this paper, we propose to tackle this task jointly with unsupervised video object segmentation, in real-time, with a unified framework to exploit the synergy between the two. Specifically, we propose a Weighted Correlation Siamese Network (WCS-Net) which employs a Weighted Correlation Block (WCB) for encoding the pixel-wise correspondence between a template frame and the search frame. In addition, WCB takes the initial mask / hotspot as guidance to enhance the influence of salient regions for robust tracking. Our system can operate online during inference and jointly produce the object mask and hotspot track-lets at 33 FPS. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our network design, and show the benefits of jointly solving the hotspot tracking and object segmentation problems. In particular, our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art video eye gaze models in object hotspot tracking, and outperforms existing methods on three benchmark datasets for unsupervised video object segmentation.\"",

Specifically, we propose a two-stage visual consistency network (VCN), meant to estimate where to fill (via masks) and generate what to fill. In this procedure, the unavoidable potential mask prediction errors lead to severe artifacts in the subsequent repairing. To address it, our VCN predicts semantically inconsistent regions first, making mask prediction more tractable. Then it repairs these estimated missing regions using a new spatial normalization, enabling VCN to be robust to the mask prediction errors. In this way, semantically convincing and visually compelling content is thus generated. Extensive experiments are conducted, showing our method is effective and robust in blind image inpainting. And our VCN allows for a wide spectrum of applications.\"",

        "abstract": "Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) is a task to localize the temporal moment in untrimmed video specified by natural language query. For VMR, several methods that require full supervision for training have been proposed. Unfortunately, acquiring a large number of training videos with labeled temporal boundaries for each query is a labor-intensive process. This paper explores a method for performing VMR in a weakly-supervised manner (wVMR): training is performed without temporal moment labels but only with the text query that describes a segment of the video. Existing methods on wVMR generate multi-scale proposals and apply query-guided attention mechanism to highlight the most relevant proposal. To leverage the weak supervision, contrastive learning is used which predicts higher scores for the correct video-query pairs than for the incorrect pairs. It has been observed that a large number of candidate proposals, coarse query representation, and one-way attention mechanism lead to blurry attention map which limits the localization performance. To address this issue, Video-Language Alignment Network (VLANet) is proposed that learns a sharper attention by pruning out spurious candidate proposals and applying a multi-directional attention mechanism with fine-grained query representation. The Surrogate Proposal Selection module selects a proposal based on the proximity to the query in the joint embedding space, and thus substantially reduces candidate proposals which leads to lower computation load and sharper attention. Next, the Cascaded Cross-modal Attention module considers dense feature interactions and multi-directional attention flows to learn the multi-modal alignment. VLANet is trained end-to-end using contrastive loss which enforces semantically similar videos and queries to cluster. The experiments show that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance on Charades-STA and DiDeMo datasets.\"",

ADL have two specific properties (i) subtle spatio-temporal patterns and (ii) similar visual patterns varying with time. Therefore, ADL may look very similar and often necessitate to look at their fine-grained details to distinguish them. Because the recent spatio-temporal 3D ConvNets are too rigid to capture the subtle visual patterns across an action, we propose a novel Video-Pose Network: VPN. The 2 key components of this VPN are a spatial embedding and an attention network. The spatial embedding projects the 3D poses and RGB cues in a common semantic space. This enables the action recognition framework to learn better spatio-temporal features exploiting both modalities. In order to discriminate similar actions, the attention network provides two functionalities - (i) an end-to-end learnable pose backbone exploiting the topology of human body, and (ii) a coupler to provide joint spatio-temporal attention weights across a video. Experiments show that VPN outperforms the state-of-the-art results for action classification on a large scale human activity dataset: NTU-RGB+D 120, its subset NTU-RGB+D 60, a real-world challenging human activity dataset: Toyota Smarthome and a small scale human-object interaction dataset Northwestern UCLA.\"",

In this paper, we investigate whether visual question answering (VQA) systems trained to answer a question about an image, are able to answer the logical composition of multiple such questions. When put under this extit{Lens of Logic}, state-of-the-art VQA models have difficulty in correctly answering these logically composed questions. We construct an augmentation of the VQA dataset as a benchmark, with questions containing logical compositions and linguistic transformations (negation, disjunction, conjunction, and antonyms). We propose our {Lens of Logic (LOL)} model which uses question-attention and logic-attention to understand logical connectives in the question, and a novel Fr\u00e9chet-Compatibility Loss, which ensures that the answers of the component questions and the composed question are consistent with the inferred logical operation. Our model shows substantial improvement in learning logical compositions while retaining performance on VQA. We suggest this work as a move towards robustness by embedding logical connectives in visual understanding.\"",

Such many-to-one nature is particularly magnified when super-resolving with large upscaling factors from very low dimensional domains such as 8$ imes$8 resolution where detailed information of HR is hardly discovered. Most existing methods are optimized for deterministic generation of SR images under pre-defined objectives such as pixel-level reconstruction and thus limited to the one-to-one correspondence between LR and SR images against the nature. In this paper, we propose VarSR, Variational Super Resolution Network, that matches latent distributions of LR and HR images to recover the missing details. Specifically, we draw samples from the learned common latent distribution of LR and HR to generate diverse SR images as the many-to-one relationship. Experimental results validate that our method can produce more accurate and perceptually plausible SR images from very low resolutions compared to the deterministic techniques.\"",

One of the key steps is to add a blank symbol to the target vocabulary. However, CTC tends to output spiky distributions since it prefers to output blank symbol most of the time. These spiky distributions show inferior alignments and the non-blank symbols are not learned sufficiently. To remedy this, we propose variational CTC (Var-CTC) to enhance the learning of non-blank symbols. The proposed Var-CTC converts the output distribution of vanilla CTC with hierarchy distribution. It first learns the approximated posterior distribution of blank to determine whether to output a specific non-blank symbol or not. Then it learns the alignment between non-blank symbols and input sequence. Experiments on scene text recognition and offline handwritten text recognition show Var-CTC achieves better alignments. Besides, with the enhanced learning of non-blank symbols, the confidence scores of model outputs are more discriminative. Compared with the vanilla CTC, the proposed Var-CTC can improve the recall performance by a large margin when the models maintain the same level of precision.\"",

Well-known consequences of poorly picked priors are posterior and mode collapse. To our knowledge, no existing method sidesteps this user choice. Conversely, extit{diffusion maps} automatically infer the data topology and enjoy a rigorous connection to manifold learning, but do not scale easily or provide the inverse homeomorphism (i.e. decoder/generator). We propose a method that combines these approaches into a generative model that inherits the asymptotic guarantees of extit{diffusion maps} while preserving the scalability of deep models.

We achieve success as well as a performance boost by a robust feature learning that the referred identity can be accurately bundled by multiple attribute cues. To be concrete, our Visual-Textual Attribute Alignment model (dubbed as ViTAA) learns to disentangle the feature space of a person into sub-spaces corresponding to attributes using a light auxiliary attribute segmentation layer. It then aligns these visual features with the textual attributes parsed from the sentences via a novel contrastive learning loss. We validate our ViTAA framework through extensive experiments on tasks of person search by natural language and by attribute-phrase queries, on which our system achieves state-of-the-art performances.\"",

Specifically, a detection model is applied on sparse keyframes to handle new objects, occlusions, and rapid motions. We then use real-time trackers to exploit temporal cues and track the detected objects in the remaining frames, which enhances efficiency and temporal coherence. Object status at the bounding-box level is propagated across frames and updated by our aggregation modules. For keyframe scheduling, we propose adaptive policies using reinforcement learning and simple heuristics. The proposed framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the Imagenet VID 2015 dataset while running real-time on CPU.

Specifically, we exploit an episodic memory network, organized as a fully connected graph, to store frames as nodes and capture cross-frame correlations by edges. Further, learnable controllers are embedded to ease memory reading and writing, as well as maintain a fixed memory scale. The structured, external memory design enables our model to comprehensively mine and quickly store new knowl- edge, even with limited visual information, and the differentiable memory controllers slowly learn an abstract method for storing useful represen- tations in the memory and how to later use these representations for prediction, via gradient descent. In addition, the proposed graph mem- ory network yields a neat yet principled framework, which can generalize well to both one-shot and zero-shot video object segmentation tasks.

Since the amplitude of the physiological signals is usually very small, they can be easily affected by head movements, lighting conditions, and sensor diversities. To address these challenges, we propose a cross-verified feature disentangling strategy to disentangle the physiological features with non-physiological representations such as head movements and lighting conditions, and then use the distilled physiological features for robust multi-task physiological measurements. We first transform the input face videos into a multi-scale spatial-temporal map (MSTmap), which can suppress the irrelevant background and noise features while retaining most of the temporal characteristics of the periodic physiological signals. Then we take pairwise MSTmaps as inputs to an autoencoder architecture with two encoders (one for physiological signals and the other for non-physiological information) and use a cross-verified scheme to obtain physiological features disentangled with the non-physiological features. The disentangled features are finally used for the joint prediction of multiple physiological signals like average HR values and rPPG signals. Comprehensive experiments on different large-scale public datasets of multiple physiological measurement tasks as well as the cross-database testing demonstrate the robustness of our approach.\"",

In this paper, we propose an approach for learning a compact view-invariant embedding space from 2D joint keypoints alone, without explicitly predicting 3D poses. Since 2D poses are projected from 3D space, they have an inherent ambiguity, which is difficult to represent through a deterministic mapping. Hence, we use probabilistic embeddings to model this input uncertainty. Experimental results show that our embedding model achieves higher accuracy when retrieving similar poses across different camera views, in comparison with 2D-to-3D pose lifting models. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of applying our embeddings to view-invariant action recognition and video alignment. Our code will be released for research.\"",

Features from multiple per view predictions are finally fused on 3D mesh vertices to predict mesh semantic segmentation labels.

        "abstract": "Human-Object interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize and infer relationships between human and objects in an image. It is challenging because an enormous number of possible combinations of objects and verbs types forms a long-tail distribution. We devise a deep Visual Compositional Learning (VCL) framework, which is a simple yet efficient framework to effectively address this problem. VCL first decomposes an HOI representation into object and verb specific features, and then composes new interaction samples in the feature space via stitching the decomposed features. The integration of decomposition and composition enables VCL to share object and verb features among different HOI samples and images, and to generate new interaction samples and new types of HOI, and thus largely alleviates the long-tail distribution problem and benefits low-shot or zero-shot HOI detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed VCL can effectively improve the generalization of HOI detection on HICO-DET and V-COCO and outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods on HICO-DET.\"",

The questions can be about objects and relationships in one or more images or about the entire scene depicted by the image set.

The indoor-scene dataset contains 91,479 human-annotated questions for 48,138 image sets, and the outdoor-scene dataset has 49,617 questions for 12,746 image sets. We analyze the properties of the two datasets, including question-and-answer distributions, types of questions, biases in dataset, and question-image dependencies.

The challenges in this task include but not limited to: (1) both the subject and object are required to be spatio-temporally localized to ground a query relation; (2) the temporal dynamic nature of visual relations in videos is difficult to capture; and (3) the grounding should be achieved without any direct supervision in space and time. To ground the relations, we tackle the challenges by collaboratively optimizing two sequences of regions over a constructed hierarchical spatio-temporal region graph through relation attending and reconstruction, in which we further propose a message passing mechanism by spatial attention shifting between visual entities. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can not only outperform baseline approaches significantly, but also produces visually meaningful facts to support visual grounding.

We then unify all the relation-units to produce the visual-relation layout, i.e., bounding-boxes for all the entities so that each of them uniquely corresponds to each entity while keeping its involved relations. Our visual-relation layout reflects the scene structure given in the input text. The stacking-GANs is the stack of three GANs conditioned on the visual-relation layout and the output of previous GAN, consistently capturing the scene structure.

We propose Visual COMET, the novel framework of visual common-sense reasoning tasks to predict events that might have happened before, events that might happen next, and the intents of the people at present. To support research toward visual commonsense reasoning, we introduce the first large-scale repository of Visual Commonsense Graphs that consists of over 1.4 million textual descriptions of visual commonsense inferences carefully annotated over a diverse set of 59,000 images, each paired with short video summaries of before and after. In addition, we provide person-grounding (i.e., co-reference links) between people appearing in the image and people mentioned in the textual commonsense descriptions, allowing for tighter integration between images and text. We establish strong baseline performances on this task and demonstrate that integration between visual and textual commonsense reasoning is the key and wins over non-integrative alternatives.\"",

We design our VTN as an encoder-decoder network, with modules dedicated to letting the information flow across the feature channels, to account for the dependencies between the semantic parts.

        "abstract": "Estimating 3D hand pose from 2D images is a difficult, inverse problem due to the inherent scale and depth ambiguities. Current state-of-the-art methods train fully supervised deep neural networks with 3D ground-truth data. However, acquiring 3D annotations is expensive, typically requiring calibrated multi-view setups or labour intensive manual annotations. While annotations of 2D keypoints are much easier to obtain, how to efficiently leverage such extit{weakly-supervised} data to improve the task of 3D hand pose prediction remains an important open question. The key difficulty stems from the fact that direct application of additional 2D supervision mostly benefits the 2D proxy objective but does little to alleviate the depth and scale ambiguities. Embracing this challenge we propose a set of novel losses that constrain the prediction of a neural network to lie within the range of biomechanically feasible 3D hand configurations. We show by extensive experiments that our proposed constraints significantly reduce the depth ambiguity and allow the network to more effectively leverage additional 2D annotated images. For example, on the challenging freiHAND dataset, using additional 2D annotation without our proposed biomechanical constraints reduces the depth error by only $15\\%$, whereas the error is reduced significantly by $50\\%$ when the proposed biomechanical constraints are used. \"",

        "abstract": "Monocular 3D human pose and shape estimation is challenging due to the many degrees of freedom of the human body and the difficulty to acquire training data for large-scale supervised learning in complex visual scenes where humans with diverse shape and appearance, appear against complex backgrounds,in a variety of poses, and are partially occluded, or involved in interactions. Essential to learning is leveraging effective 3D human priors, and the ability to work under weak supervision, at scale, by exploiting, to the largest extent, the detailed human body semantics in images. In this paper we present new priors as well as large-scale weakly supervised models for 3D human pose and shape estimation. Key to our formulation are new latent normalizing flow representations, as well as fully differentiable, structurally-sensitive, semantic body part alignment(re-projection) loss functions that ensure consistent estimates and sharp feedback signals for learning. In extensive experiments using both motion capture datasets like CMU, Human3.6M, 3DPW, or AMASS, and repositories like COCO, we show that our proposed methods outperform existing counterparts, supporting the construction of an increasingly more accurate family of models based on large-scale training with unlabeled image data. \"",

        "abstract": "It is laborious to manually label point cloud data for training high-quality 3D object detectors. This work proposes a weakly supervised approach for 3D object detection, only requiring a small set of weakly annotated scenes, associated with a few precisely labeled object instances. This is achieved by a two-stage architecture design. Stage-1 learns to generate cylindrical object proposals under weak supervision, i.e., only the horizontal centers of objects are click-annotated on bird\u2019s view scenes. Stage-2 learns to refine the cylindrical proposals to get cuboids and confidence scores, using a few well-labeled object instances. Using only 500 weakly annotated scenes and 534 precisely labeled vehicle instances, our method achieves 85\u223c95% of performance of current top-leading, fully supervised detectors (requiring 3,712 exhaustively and precisely annotated scenes with 15,654 instances). Moreover, with our elaborately designed network architecture, our trained model can be applied as a 3D object annotator, supporting both automatic and active (human-in-the-loop) working modes. The annotations generated by our model can be used to train 3D object detectors achieving 94% of their original performance (with manually labeled data). Our experiments also show our model's potential in boosting performance when given more training data. Above designs make our approach highly practical and introduce new opportunities for learning 3D object detection at reduced annotation cost.\"",

The samples drawn from our conditional distribution provide accurate pseudo labels due to the use of semantic class aware unary terms, boundary aware pairwise smoothness terms, and annotation aware higher order terms. Furthermore, we represent the instance segmentation model as an annotation agnostic prediction distribution. In contrast to previous methods, our representation allows us to define a joint probabilistic learning objective that minimizes the dissimilarity between the two distributions.

To tackle this problem, some image related side information, such as captions and tags, often reveal underlying relationships across images. In this paper, we present an efficient weakly-supervised learning by using a Side Information Network (SINet), which aims to effectively carry out a large scale classication with severely noisy labels. The proposed SINet consists of a visual prototype module and a noise weighting module. The visual prototype module is designed to generate a compact representation for each category by introducing the side information. The noise weighting module aims to estimate the correctness of each noisy image and produce a condence score for image ranking during the training procedure. The propsed SINet can largely alleviate the negative impact of noisy image labels, and is benecial to train a high performance CNN based classier. Besides, we release a ne-grained product dataset called AliProducts, which contains more than 2.5 million noisy web images crawled from the internet by using queries generated from 50,000 fine-grained semantic classes. Extensive experiments on several popular benchmarks (i.e. Webvision, ImageNet and Clothing-1M) and our proposed AliProducts achieve state-of-the-art performance.

It can be solved under the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework, where a bag (video) contains multiple instances (action segments). Since only the bag's label is known, the main challenge is assigning which key instances within the bag to trigger the bag's label. Most previous models use attention-based approaches applying attentions to generate the bag's representation from instances, and then train it via the bag's classification. These models, however, implicitly violate the MIL assumption that instances in negative bags should be uniformly negative. In this work, we explicitly model the key instances assignment as a hidden variable and adopt an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework. We derive two pseudo-label generation schemes to model the E and M process and iteratively optimize the likelihood lower bound. We show that our EM-MIL approach more accurately models both the learning objective and the MIL assumptions.

The network jointly optimizes canonical shapes and poses with multi-view geometry constraints during training, and can infer the complete shape given a single partial point cloud.

Although there are many solutions to capture pure human motion readily available, their data is not sufficient to analyze quality and efficiency of movements. Instead, the forces and moments driving human motion (the dynamics) need to be considered. Since recording dynamics is a laborious task that requires expensive sensors and complex, time-consuming optimization, dynamics data sets are small compared to human motion data sets and are rarely made public. The proposed approach takes advantage of easily obtainable motion data which enables weakly-supervised learning on small dynamics sets and weakly-supervised domain transfer. Our method includes novel neural network (NN) layers for forward and inverse dynamics during end-to-end training. On this basis, a cyclic loss between pure motion data can be minimized, i.e. no ground truth forces and moments are required during training. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of ground reaction force, ground reaction moment and joint torque regression and is able to maintain good performance on substantially reduced sets.\"",

Although WSL benefits from fast and low-cost data expansion, noisy web labels prevent models from reliable predictions. To mitigate this problem, self-labeled supervised loss $\\mathcal{L}_s$ is utilized together with webly supervised loss $\\mathcal{L}_w$ in recent works. $\\mathcal{L}_s$ relies on machine labels predicted by the model itself. Since whether web labels or machine labels being correct is usually on a case-by-case basis for web samples, it is desirable to adjust balance between $\\mathcal{L}_s$ and $\\mathcal{L}_w$ at a sample-level. Inspired by DNNs' ability on confidence prediction, we introduce self-contained confidence (SCC) by adapting model uncertainty for WSL setting and use it to sample-wisely balance $\\mathcal{L}_s$ and $\\mathcal{L}_w$. Thus, a simple yet effective WSL framework is proposed. A series of SCC-friendly approaches are investigated, among which our proposed graph-enhanced mixup stands out as the most effective approach to provide high-quality confidence to boost our framework.

In contrast to existing counting models that directly output count values, we divide one-step estimation into a sequence of much easier and more tractable sub-decision problems. Such sequential decision nature corresponds exactly to a physical process in reality|scale weighing. Inspired by scale weighing, we propose a novel \u2018counting scale\u2019 termed LibraNet where the count value is analogized by weight. By virtually placing a crowd image on one side of a scale, LibraNet (agent) sequentially learns to place appropriate weights on the other side to match the crowd count. At each step, LibraNet chooses one weight (action) from the weight box (the pre-defined action pool) according to the current crowd image features and weights placed on the scale pan (state). LibraNet is required to learn to balance the scale according to the feedback of the needle (Q values). We show that LibraNet exactly implements scale weighing by visualizing the decision process how LibraNet chooses actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our design choices and report state-of-the-art results on a few crowd counting benchmarks, including ShanghaiTech, UCF_CC_50 and UCF-QNRF. We also demonstrate good cross-dataset generalization of LibraNet. Code and models are made available at https://git.io/libranet\"",

        "abstract": "Although convolutional neural networks perform extremely well for numerous computer vision tasks, a considerably large amount of labeled data is required to ensure a good outcome. Data labeling is labor-intensive, and in some cases, the labeling budget may be limited. Active learning is a technique that can reduce the labeling required. With this technique, the neural network selects on its own the unlabeled data most helpful for learning, and then requests the human annotator for the labels. Most existing active learning methods have focused on acquisition functions for an effective selection of the informative samples. However, in this paper, we focus on the data-incremental nature of active learning, and propose a method for properly tuning the weight decay as the amount of data increases. We also demonstrate that the performance can be improved by knowledge distillation using a low-performance teacher model trained from the previous acquisition step. In addition, we present a novel perspective of the weight decay, which provides a regularization effect by limiting the number of effective parameters and channels in the convolutional filter. We validate our methods on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets using convolutional neural networks of various sizes.\"",

More formally, we identify two characteristics of a weight, its magnitude and its location, which can be linked with the importance of the weight. By targeting these characteristics of a weight during training, we develop two separate weight excitation (WE) mechanisms via weight reparameterization-based backpropagation modifications. We demonstrate significant improvements over popular baseline ConvNets on multiple computer vision applications using WE (e.g. 1.3% accuracy improvement over ResNet50 baseline on ImageNet image classification, etc.). These improvements come at no extra computational cost or ConvNet structural change during inference. Additionally, including WE methods in a convolution block is straightforward, requiring few lines of extra code. Lastly, WE mechanisms can provide complementary benefits when used with external attention mechanisms such as the popular Squeeze-and-Excitation attention block.\"",

We use the WeightNet, composed entirely of (grouped) fully-connected layers, to directly output the convolutional weight. WeightNet is easy and memory-conserving to train, on the kernel space instead of the feature space. Because of the flexibility, our method outperforms existing approaches on both ImageNet and COCO detection tasks, achieving better Accuracy-FLOPs and Accuracy-Parameter trade-offs. The framework on the flexible weight space has the potential to further improve the performance.\"",

The recently proposed deep uncalibrated photometric stereo method achieved promising results in estimating directional lightings. However, what specifically inside the network contributes to its success remains a mystery. In this paper, we analyze the features learned by this method and find that they strikingly resemble attached shadows, shadings, and specular highlights, which are known to provide useful clues in resolving the generalized bas-relief (GBR) ambiguity. Based on this insight, we propose a guided calibration network, named GCNet, that explicitly leverages object shape and shading information for improved lighting estimation. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that GCNet achieves improved results in lighting estimation for photometric stereo, which echoes the findings of our analysis. We further demonstrate that GCNet can be directly integrated with existing calibrated methods to achieve improved results on surface normal estimation.\"",

We use a patch-based classifier with limited receptive fields to focus on low-level artifacts rather than global semantics, and use patch-wise predictions to localize the manipulated regions. We further show a technique to exaggerate these detectable properties and demonstrate that even when the image generator is adversarially finetuned against the fakeness classifier, it is still imperfect and makes detectable mistakes in similar regions of the image.\"",

The improvements are greater when the training set is smaller or the task is more challenging. Although the benefits of SSL may increase with larger training sets, we observe that SSL can hurt the performance when the distributions of images used for meta-learning and SSL are different.

One of the major contributions of this work is about introducing a new representation for the 3D reconstruction history as an auxiliary utility map which is efficiently coupled with the current depth observation. With both pieces of information, we train a light-weight CNN, named ExHistCNN, that estimates the NBV as a set of directions towards which the depth sensor finds most unexplored areas. We perform extensive evaluation on both synthetic and real room scans demonstrating that the proposed ExHistCNN is able to approach the exploration performance of an oracle using the complete knowledge of the 3D environment.\"",

In order to capture the large shape variety of dogs, we show that the natural variation in the 2D dataset is enough to learn a detailed 3D prior through expectation maximisation (EM).

As existing datasets do not have whole-body annotations, previous methods have to assemble different deep models trained independently on different datasets of the human face, hand, and body, struggling with dataset biases and large model complexity. To fill in this blank, we introduce COCO-WholeBody which extends COCO dataset with whole-body annotations. To our best knowledge, it is the first benchmark that has manual annotations on the entire human body, including 133 dense landmarks with 68 on the face, 42 on hands and 23 on the body and feet. A single-network model, named ZoomNet, is devised to take into account the hierarchical structure of the full human body to solve the scale variation of different body parts of the same person. ZoomNet is able to significantly outperform existing methods on the proposed COCO-WholeBody dataset. Extensive experiments show that COCO-WholeBody not only can be used to train deep models from scratch for whole-body pose estimation but also can serve as a powerful pre-training dataset for many different tasks such as facial landmark detection and hand keypoint estimation.

It is believed that these features are better at encoding the perceptual quality and provide more efficient representations of input images compared to other perceptual metrics such as SSIM and PSNR. However, there have been no systematic studies to determine the underlying reason. Due to the lack of such an analysis, it is not possible to evaluate the performance of a particular set of features or to improve the perceptual quality even more by carefully selecting a subset of features from a pre-trained CNN. This work shows that the capabilities of pre-trained deep CNN features in optimizing the perceptual quality are correlated with their success in capturing basic human visual perception characteristics. In particular, we focus our analysis on fundamental aspects of human perception, such as the contrast sensitivity and orientation selectivity. We introduce two new formulations to measure the frequency and orientation selectivity of the features learned by convolutional layers for evaluating deep features learned by widely-used deep CNNs such as VGG-16. We demonstrate that the pre-trained CNN features which receive higher scores are better at predicting human quality judgment. Furthermore, we show the possibility of using our method to select deep features to form a new loss function, which improves the image reconstruction quality for the well-known single-image super-resolution problem. \"",

In this paper, we introduce Salient Attributes for Network Explanation (SANE) to explain image similarity models, where a model's output is a score measuring the similarity of two inputs rather than a classification score. In this task, an explanation depends on both of the input images, so standard methods do not apply. Our SANE explanations pairs a saliency map identifying important image regions with an attribute that best explains the match. We find that our explanations provide additional information not typically captured by saliency maps alone, and can also improve performance on the classic task of attribute recognition.

        "abstract": "Video-to-video synthesis is a powerful tool for converting high-level semantic inputs to photorealistic videos. However, while existing vid2vid methods can maintain short-term temporal consistency, they fail to ensure long-term consistency in the outputs. This is because they generate each frame only based on the past few frames. They lack knowledge of the 3D world being generated. In this work, we propose a framework for utilizing all past generated frames when synthesizing each frame. This is achieved by condensing the 3D world generated so far into a physically-grounded estimate of the current frame, which we call the guidance image. A novel module is also proposed to take advantage of the information stored in the guidance images. Extensive experimental results on several challenging datasets verify the effectiveness of our method in achieving world consistency - the output video is consistent within the entire generated 3D world.",

We propose a new method of domain adaptation for merging multiple models with less effort than creating an additional dataset. This method merges pre-trained models in different domains using the glue layers and the generative model, which feeds latent features to train the glue layers without an additional dataset. We also propose the generative model created by knowledge distillation from pre-trained models. It also allows reusing the dataset to create latent features for training the glue layers. We apply this method to object detection in a low-light situation. The \u201cYOLO in the Dark\u201d contains two models, \u201cLearning to See in the Dark\u201d and YOLO. We report the new method and the result of domain adaptation that detect objects from raw short-exposure low-light images.

The method generalises a previous fixed semantic feature based approach and achieves significantly higher localisation accuracy and faster convergence.\"",

        "abstract": "In the past few years, we have witnessed the great progress of image super-resolution (SR) thanks to the power of deep learning. However, a major limitation of the current image SR approaches is that they assume a pre-determined degradation model or kernel, e.g. bicubic, controls the image degradation process. This makes them easily fail to generalize in a real-world or non-ideal environment since the degradation model of an unseen image may not obey the pre-determined kernel used when training the SR model. In this work, we present a simple yet effective zero-shot image super-resolution model. Our zero-shot SR model learns an image-specific super-resolution network (SRN) from a low-resolution input image alone, without relying on external training sets. To circumvent the difficulty caused by the unknown internal degradation model of an image, we propose to learn an image-specific degradation simulation network (DSN) together with our image-specific SRN. Specifically, we exploit the depth information, naturally indicating the scales of local image patches, of an image to extract the unpaired high/low-resolution patch collection to train our networks. According to the benchmark test on four datasets with depth labels or estimated depth maps, our proposed depth guided degradation model learning based image super-resolution (DGDML-SR) achieves visually pleasing results and can outperform the state-of-the-arts in perceptual metrics.\"",

A capsule is a group of neurons nested inside each layer, and the one in the last layer is called a class capsule, which is a vector whose norm indicates a predicted probability for the class. Using the class capsule, existing Capsule Networks already provide some level of interpretability. However, there are two limitations which degrade its interpretability: 1) the class capsule also includes classification-irrelevant information, and 2) entities represented by the class capsule overlap. In this work, we address these two limitations using a novel class-supervised disentanglement algorithm and an additional regularizer, respectively. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations on three datasets, we demonstrate that the resulting classifier, iCaps, provides a prediction along with clear rationales behind it with no performance degradation.\"",

However, it still remains challenging to predict saliency maps on images in new domains that lack sufficient data for data-hungry models. To solve this problem, we propose a few-shot transfer learning paradigm for saliency prediction, which enables efficient transfer of knowledge learned from the existing large-scale saliency datasets to a target domain with limited labeled examples. Specifically, very few target domain examples are used as the reference to train a model with a source domain dataset such that the training process can converge to a local minimum in favor of the target domain. Then, the learned model is further fine-tuned with the reference. The proposed framework is gradient-based and model-agnostic. We conduct comprehensive experiments and ablation study on various source domain and target domain pairs. The results show that the proposed framework achieves a significant performance improvement.

We show that both geometric parameters (shape, pose and camera intrinsics) and photometric parameters (texture and lighting) can be inferred directly from the correspondence map using linear least squares and our novel inverse spherical harmonic lighting model. The least squares residuals provide an unsupervised training signal that allows us to avoid artefacts common in the literature such as shrinking and conservative underfitting. Our approach uses a network that is 10$ imes$ smaller than parameter regression networks, significantly reduces sensitivity to image alignment and allows known camera calibration or multi-image constraints to be incorporated during inference. We achieve results competitive with state-of-the-art but without any auxiliary supervision used by previous methods.\"",
