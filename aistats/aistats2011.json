In this paper, we consider the recovery of jointly sparse signals in the multiple measurement vector (MMV) scenario where signal is represented as a matrix and the sparsity of signal occurs in a common location set. The sparse MMV model can be formulated as a matrix $(2,1)$-norm minimization problem. However, the $(2,1)$-norm minimization problem is much more difficult to solve than l1-norm minimization. In this paper, we propose a very fast algorithm, called MMV-ADM, for jointly sparse signal recovery in MMV settings based on the alternating direction method (ADM). The MMV-ADM alternately updates the signal matrix, the Lagrangian multiplier and the residue, and all update rules only involve matrix or vector multiplications and summations, so it is simple, easy to implement and much more fast than the state-of-the-art method MMVprox.

        "abstract": "The Nystr\u00f6m method is an efficient technique for obtaining a low-rank approximation of a large kernel matrix based on a subset of its columns. The quality of the Nystr\u00f6m  approximation highly depends on the subset of columns used, which are usually selected using random sampling. This paper presents a novel recursive algorithm for calculating the Nystr\u00f6m approximation, and an effective greedy criterion for column selection.

This paper seeks to close the gap at the thematic level via topic adaptation, i.e., adjusting topical structures for cross-domain documents according to a domain factor such as technicality. We present a probabilistic model for this purpose based on joint modeling of topic and technicality.

This paper shows that rectifying neurons are an even better model of biological neurons and yield equal or better performance than hyperbolic tangent networks in spite of the hard non-linearity and non-differentiability at zero, creating sparse representations with true zeros which seem remarkably suitable for naturally sparse data.

Rather, the relations between variables are represented implicitly, and are learned nonparametrically from training data. KBP has the advantage that it may be used on any domain where kernels are defined ($\\mathbb{R}^d$, strings, groups), even where explicit parametric models are not known, or closed form expressions for the BP updates do not exist.  The computational cost of message updates in KBP is polynomial in the training data size.

For many applications, it may be impossible or impractical to obtain such datasets, but multiple datasets of i.i.d. observations for different subsets of these variables may be available. Tillman et al. (2009) showed how directed graphical models learned from such datasets can be integrated to construct an equivalence class of structures over all variables. While their procedure is correct, it assumes that the structures integrated do not entail contradictory conditional independences and dependences for variables in their intersections. While this assumption is reasonable asymptotically, it rarely holds in practice with finite samples due to the frequency of statistical errors.

In this paper, we introduce a clustering model based on the large volume principle called maximum volume clustering (MVC), and propose two algorithms to solve it approximately: a soft-label and a hard-label MVC algorithms based on sequential quadratic programming and semi-definite programming, respectively. Our MVC model includes spectral clustering and maximum margin clustering as special cases, and is substantially more general.

        "abstract": "We examine the consistency of listwise ranking methods with respect to the popular Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) criterion. The most successful listwise approaches replace NDCG with a surrogate that is easier to optimize. We characterize NDCG consistent surrogates to discover a surprising fact: several commonly used surrogates are NDCG inconsistent. We then show how to change them so that they become NDCG consistent in a strong but natural sense. An explicit characterization of strong NDCG consistency is provided. Going beyond qualitative consistency considerations, we also give quantitive statements that enable us to transform the excess error, as measured in the surrogate, to the excess error in comparison to the Bayes optimal ranking function for NDCG. Finally, we also derive improved results if a certain natural \u201clow noise\u201d or \u201clarge margin\u201d condition holds.

The most successful listwise approaches replace NDCG with a surrogate that is easier to optimize. We characterize NDCG consistent surrogates to discover a surprising fact: several commonly used surrogates are NDCG inconsistent. We then show how to change them so that they become NDCG consistent in a strong but natural sense. An explicit characterization of strong NDCG consistency is provided. Going beyond qualitative consistency considerations, we also give quantitive statements that enable us to transform the excess error, as measured in the surrogate, to the excess error in comparison to the Bayes optimal ranking function for NDCG. Finally, we also derive improved results if a certain natural \u201clow noise\u201d or \u201clarge margin\u201d condition holds. Our experiments demonstrate that ensuring NDCG consistency does improve the performance of listwise ranking methods on real-world datasets.

Most existing market-based algorithms, however, suffer from two main drawbacks: resource prices must be carefully handcrafted for each problem domain, and there is no guarantee on final solution quality.  We present an optimal market-based algorithm, derived from a mixed integer program formulation of planning problems.  Our method is based on two well-known techniques for optimization: Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition and Gomory cuts. The former prices resources optimally for a relaxed version of the problem, while the latter introduces new derivative resources to correct pricing imbalances that arise from the relaxation. Our algorithm is applicable to a wide variety of multi-agent planning domains.  We provide optimality guarantees and demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in both centralized and distributed settings on synthetic planning problems.",

Recent work in parallel Gibbs sampling has focused on update schedules which do not guarantee convergence to the intended stationary distribution.  In this work, we propose two methods to construct parallel Gibbs samplers guaranteed to draw from the targeted distribution. The first method, called the Chromatic sampler, uses graph coloring to construct a direct parallelization of the classic sequential scan Gibbs sampler.  In the case of 2-colorable models we relate the Chromatic sampler to the Synchronous Gibbs sampler (which draws all variables simultaneously in parallel), and reveal new ergodic properties of Synchronous Gibbs chains.  Our second method, the Splash sampler, is a complementary strategy which can be used when the variables are tightly coupled. This constructs and samples multiple blocks in parallel, using a novel locking protocol and an iterative junction tree generation algorithm.  We further improve the Splash sampler through adaptive tree construction.  We demonstrate the benefits of our two sampling algorithms on large synthetic and real-world models using a 32 processor multi-core system.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of imitation learning where the examples, demonstrated by an expert, cover only a small part of a large state space. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) provides an efficient tool for generalizing the demonstration, based on the assumption that the expert is optimally acting in a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Most of the past work on IRL requires that a (near)-optimal policy can be computed for different reward functions. However, this requirement can hardly be satisfied in systems with a large, or continuous, state space. In this paper, we propose a model-free IRL algorithm, where the relative entropy between the empirical distribution of the state-action trajectories under a baseline policy and their distribution under the learned policy is minimized by stochastic gradient descent. We compare this new approach to well-known IRL algorithms using learned MDP models. Empirical results on simulated car racing, gridworld and ball-in-a-cup problems show that our approach is able to learn good policies from a small number of demonstrations.",

One of the fastest algorithms for NMF is the Block Principal Pivoting method (BPP) of (Kim & Park, 2008b), which follows a block coordinate descent approach.

Taking the view that the design matrix was generated by a stochastic process, and using the asymptotic normality of the least squares estimator, we propose a method for improving the performance of BPP.

        "abstract": "Popular algorithms for modeling the influence of entities in networked data, such as PageRank, work by analyzing the hyperlink structure, but ignore the contents of documents. However, often times, influence is topic dependent, e.g., a web page of high influence in politics may be an unknown entity in sports.  We design a new model called TopicFlow, which combines ideas from network flow and topic modeling, to learn this notion of topic specific influences of hyperlinked documents in a completely unsupervised fashion. On the task of citation recommendation, which is an instance of capturing influence, the TopicFlow model, when combined with TF-IDF based cosine similarity, outperforms several competitive baselines by as much as 11.8%. Our empirical study of the model's output on ACL corpus demonstrates its ability to identify topically influential documents. The Topic- Flow model is also competitive with the state-of-theart Relational Topic Models in predicting the likelihood of unseen text on two different data sets. Due to its ability to learn topic-specific flows across each hyperlink, the TopicFlow model can be a powerful visualization tool to track the diffusion of topics across a citation network.",

The traditional MKL approach is in general \u201cshallow\u201d in the sense that the target kernel is simply a linear (or convex)  combination of some base kernels. In this paper, we investigate a framework of Multi-Layer Multiple Kernel Learning (MLMKL) that aims to learn \u201cdeep\u201d kernel machines by exploring the combinations of multiple kernels in a multi-layer structure, which goes beyond the conventional MKL approach. Through a multiple layer mapping, the proposed MLMKL framework offers higher flexibility than the regular MKL for finding the optimal kernel for applications. As the first attempt to this new MKL framework, we present a  two-Layer Multiple Kernel Learning (2LMKL) method together with two efficient algorithms for classification tasks. We  analyze their generalization performances and have conducted  an extensive set of experiments over 16  benchmark datasets, in which encouraging results showed that our method outperformed the conventional MKL methods.",
