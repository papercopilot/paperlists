A recent empirical study by Wallace compared the performance of standard model selection methods in a one-dimensional polynomial regression framework. The results from this study provided strong evidence in support of the MML and SRM based methods over the other standard approaches. In this paper we present a detailed empirical evaluation of three model selection methods which include an MML based approach and two SRM based methods.

It is shown that the HME mean functions can approximate the true mean function, at a rate of $O(m^{-2/s})$ in $L_p$ norm. Moreover, the HME probability density functions can approximate the true density, at a rate of $O(m^{-2/s})$ in Hellinger distance, and at a rate of $O(m^{-4/s})$ in Kullback-Leibler divergence. These rates can be achieved within the family of HME structures with a tree of binary splits, or within the family of structures with a single layer of experts.
