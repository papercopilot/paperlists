        "abstract": "We propose a sequential learning policy for noisy discrete global optimization and ranking and selection (R&S) problems with high dimensional sparse belief functions, where there are hundreds or even thousands of features, but only a small portion of these features contain explanatory power. Our problem setting, motivated by the experimental sciences, arises where we have to choose which experiment to run next. Here the experiments are time-consuming and expensive. We derive a sparse knowledge gradient (SpKG) decision policy based on the \\ell_1-penalized regression Lasso to identify the sparsity pattern before our budget is exhausted. This policy is a unique and novel hybrid of Bayesian R&S with a frequentist learning approach. Theoretically, we provide the error bound of the posterior mean estimate, which has shown to be at the minimax optimal \\sqrts\\log p/n rate.

Our problem setting, motivated by the experimental sciences, arises where we have to choose which experiment to run next. Here the experiments are time-consuming and expensive. We derive a sparse knowledge gradient (SpKG) decision policy based on the \\ell_1-penalized regression Lasso to identify the sparsity pattern before our budget is exhausted. This policy is a unique and novel hybrid of Bayesian R&S with a frequentist learning approach. Theoretically, we provide the error bound of the posterior mean estimate, which has shown to be at the minimax optimal \\sqrts\\log p/n rate.

Typical applications include many popular statistical machine learning methods such as elastic-net regression, ridge penalized logistic regression, and sparse additive regression. Existing optimization literature has shown that the CBCD-type methods attain iteration complexity of O(p\u22c5\\log(1/\u03b5)),  where \u03b5is a pre-specified accuracy of the objective value, and p is the number of blocks. However, such iteration complexity explicitly depends on p, and therefore is at least p times worse than those of gradient descent methods. To bridge this theoretical gap, we propose an improved convergence analysis for the CBCD-type methods. In particular, we first show that for a family of quadratic minimization problems, the iteration complexity of the CBCD-type methods matches that of the GD methods in term of dependency on p (up to a \\log^2 p factor). Thus our complexity bounds are sharper than the existing bounds by at least a factor of p/\\log^2p. We also provide a lower bound to confirm that our improved complexity bounds are tight (up to a \\log^2 p factor) if the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix do not scale with p. Finally, we generalize our analysis to other strongly convex minimization problems beyond quadratic ones.",

Yet, kernel methods often require the user to select a predefined kernel to build an estimator with. However, there is often little reason for the common practice of selecting a kernel a priori. Even if a universal approximating kernel is selected, the quality of the finite sample estimator may be greatly affected by the choice of kernel. Furthermore, when directly applying kernel methods, one typically needs to compute a N \\times N Gram matrix of pairwise kernel evaluations to work with a dataset of N instances.

However, they are also inefficient, requiring a complete re-execution of the program on every Metropolis Hastings proposal. We present a new extension to the lightweight approach, C3, which enables efficient, incrementalized re-execution of MH proposals. C3 is based on two core ideas: transforming probabilistic programs into continuation passing style (CPS), and caching the results of function calls.  It is particularly effective at speeding up recursive programs with many local latent variables.

An appealing alternative is to use tractable probabilistic models, such as arithmetic circuits (ACs) and sum-product networks (SPNs), in which marginal and conditional queries can be answered efficiently.  In this paper, we present the first discriminative structure learning algorithm for ACs, DACLearn (Discriminative AC Learner).  Like previous work on generative structure learning, DACLearn finds a log-linear model with conjunctive features, using the size of an equivalent AC representation as a learning bias.  Unlike previous work, DACLearn optimizes conditional likelihood, resulting in a more accurate conditional distribution.  DACLearn also learns much more compact ACs than generative methods, since it does not need to represent a consistent distribution over the evidence variables.  To ensure efficiency, DACLearn uses novel initialization and search heuristics to drastically reduce the number of feature evaluations required to learn an accurate model.  In experiments on 20 benchmark domains, we find that our DACLearn learns models that are more accurate and compact than other tractable generative and discriminative methods.",

        "abstract": "Subspace clustering is the problem of clustering data points into a union of low-dimensional linear/affine subspaces. It is the mathematical abstraction of many important problems in computer vision, image processing and machine learning. A line of recent work [4, 19, 24, 20] provided strong theoretical guarantee for sparse subspace cluster- ing [4], the state-of-the-art algorithm for sub- space clustering, on both noiseless and noisy data sets. It was shown that under mild conditions, with high probability no two points from different subspaces are clustered together. Such guarantee, however, is not sufficient for the clustering to be correct, due to the notorious \u201cgraph connectivity problem\u201d [15]. In this paper, we investigate the graph connectivity problem for noisy sparse sub-space clustering and show that a simple post-processing procedure is capable of delivering consistent clustering under certain \u201cgeneral position\u201d or \u201crestricted eigenvalue\u201d assumptions.

It is the mathematical abstraction of many important problems in computer vision, image processing and machine learning. A line of recent work [4, 19, 24, 20] provided strong theoretical guarantee for sparse subspace cluster- ing [4], the state-of-the-art algorithm for sub- space clustering, on both noiseless and noisy data sets. It was shown that under mild conditions, with high probability no two points from different subspaces are clustered together. Such guarantee, however, is not sufficient for the clustering to be correct, due to the notorious \u201cgraph connectivity problem\u201d [15]. In this paper, we investigate the graph connectivity problem for noisy sparse sub-space clustering and show that a simple post-processing procedure is capable of delivering consistent clustering under certain \u201cgeneral position\u201d or \u201crestricted eigenvalue\u201d assumptions. We also show that our condition is almost tight with adversarial noise perturbation by constructing a counter-example.

Since the agent\u2019s behavior originates in its policy and MDP policies depend on both the stochastic system dynamics as well as the reward function, the solution of the inverse problem is significantly influenced by both. Current IRL approaches assume that if the transition model is unknown, additional samples from the system\u2019s dynamics are accessible, or the observed behavior provides enough samples of the system\u2019s dynamics to solve the inverse problem accurately. These assumptions are often not satisfied. To overcome this, we present a gradient-based IRL approach that simultaneously estimates the system\u2019s dynamics. By solving the combined optimization problem, our approach takes into account the bias of the demonstrations, which stems from the generating policy. The evaluation on a synthetic MDP and a transfer learning task shows improvements regarding the sample efficiency as well as the accuracy of the estimated reward functions and transition models.",

We demonstrate the wide applicability of our model using several experiments.}\n}",

Our experimental results show that when used for matrix compression, pMMF often achieves much lower error than competing algorithms (especially on network data), yet for sparse matrices its running time scales close to linearly with n.}\n}",

The obtained bounds are generically composed of three terms: 1) a dependency on \u03b3(discount factor), 2) a concentrability coefficient and 3) a propagation error term.

The adversary then generates a relevance vector and the learner updates its ranker according to the feedback received. We consider the setting where the feedback is restricted to be the relevance levels of only the top k documents in the ranked list, for k \u226am. However, the performance of learner is judged based on the unrevealed full relevance vectors, using an appropriate learning to rank loss function. We develop efficient algorithms for well known losses in the pointwise, pairwise and listwise families.

        "abstract": "Least-squares and kernel-ridge / Gaussian process regression are among the foundational algorithms of statistics and machine learning. Famously, the worst-case cost of exact nonparametric regression grows cubically with the data-set size; but a growing number of approximations have been developed that estimate good solutions at lower cost. These algorithms typically return point estimators, without measures of uncertainty. Leveraging recent results casting elementary linear algebra operations as probabilistic inference, we propose a new approximate method for nonparametric least-squares that affords a probabilistic uncertainty estimate over the error between the approximate and exact least-squares solution (this is not the same as the posterior variance of the associated Gaussian process regressor). This allows estimating the error of the least-squares solution on a subset of the data relative to the full-data solution.

Famously, the worst-case cost of exact nonparametric regression grows cubically with the data-set size; but a growing number of approximations have been developed that estimate good solutions at lower cost. These algorithms typically return point estimators, without measures of uncertainty. Leveraging recent results casting elementary linear algebra operations as probabilistic inference, we propose a new approximate method for nonparametric least-squares that affords a probabilistic uncertainty estimate over the error between the approximate and exact least-squares solution (this is not the same as the posterior variance of the associated Gaussian process regressor). This allows estimating the error of the least-squares solution on a subset of the data relative to the full-data solution.  The uncertainty can be used to control the computational effort invested in the approximation. Our algorithm has linear cost in the data-set size, and a simple formal form, so that it can be implemented with a few lines of code in programming languages with linear algebra functionality.}\n}",

We demonstrate empirically that augmenting mean field with a random projection step dramatically improves partition function and marginal probability estimates, both on synthetic and real world data.}\n}",
