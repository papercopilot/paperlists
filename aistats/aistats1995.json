        "abstract": "Many statisticians are reluctant to deal with problems involving causal considerations because we lack the mathematical notation for distinguishing causal influence from statistical association. To address this problem, a notation is proposed that admits two conditioning operators: ordinary Bayes conditioning, $P(y \\mid X=x)$, and causal conditioning, $P(y \\mid \\operatorname{set}(X=x))$, that is, conditioning $P(y)$ on holding $X$ constant (at $x)$ by external intervention. This distinction, which will be supported by three rules of inference, will permit us to derive probability expressions for the combined effect of observations and interventions. The resulting calculus yields simple solutions to a number of interesting problems in causal inference and should allow rank-and-file researchers to tackle practical problems that are generally considered too hard, or impossible. Examples are: 1. Deciding whether the information available in a given observational study is sufficient for obtaining consistent estimates of causal effects. 2. Deriving algebraic expressions for causal effect estimands. 3. Selecting measurements that would render randomized experiments unnecessary. 4. Selecting a set of indirect (randomized) experiments to replace direct experiments that are either infeasible or too expensive. 5. Predicting (or bounding) the efficacy of treatments from randomized trials with imperfect compliance. Starting with nonparametric specification of structural equations, the paper establishes the semantics necessary for a theory of interventions, presents the three rules of inference, demonstrates the use of the resulting calculus on a number of examples, and establishes an operational definition of structural equations.",

Previous failures to find admissible stopping rules in CART [3, pp 59-66] and ID3 [20, pp 36-37] are traced to coupling these biased approximations with one another or with arbitrary thresholds; problems which are overcome by the hypergeometric. Empirical results show that pre-pruning should be done, as trees pruned in this way are simpler, more efficient, and no less accurate than unpruned trees. Average training time is reduced by up to $30 %$, and expensive post-pruning avoided.},\n  note =         {Reissued by PMLR on 01 May 2022.}\n}",

        "abstract": "The problem of inferring causality from empirical observations has been well studied. Several approaches are notable for efficiently constructing complex causal models of the inter-relationships between variables ( e.g.,[8,3,2]). These approaches tend to rely on correlations and co-variances among the variables as the basis for inferring causality. However, for some applications, the available data are categorical observations over time (e.g., event streams or execution traces of programs); for example, patterns in execution traces form the basis of several methods of debugging software (e.g., [1,4]). These applications are less amenable to solution by methods based on correlation and co-variance. An alternative approach, called Dependency Detection, searches the event streams for often recurring sequences [6]. The set of recurring sequences (called dependencies) indicates events that commonly co-occur and forms a weak model of causality. Although promising, dependency detection is limited in several ways. First, the underlying search is exhaustive, looking for all possible dependencies in the data. As a consequence, the computational complexity increases exponentially with the length of the sequences. Second, the sequences are rigid, which means that only exact matches count and that any noise (i.e., insertion of some other unrelated event into the stream) will not count as an example of the sequence. Third, the technique considers only a single stream rather than multiple streams of parallel events; Oates et al. have developed a technique for multi-stream dependency detection [7]. This paper describes how local search with flexible matching has been used to overcome the first two limitations.",

Each directed hyperedge corresponds to a factor of the joint distribution of all variables in the model. A hyperedge replacement grammar is a collection of rules for replacing hyperedges with hypergraphs. A hyperedge replacement grammar for graphical belief networks defines a collection of graphical belief models.  Hyperedge replacement grammars have several interesting implications in the construction of graphical models. (1) They provide a way to represent the process of constructing a graphical model. (2) Coupled with an object-oriented variable type system, provide a convenient method for searching through candidate factors to fill a particular slot in the model graph. (3) They provide a method for integrating high-level and detailed views of a graphical model. (4) They provide a mechanism for representing uncertainty about the model structure.",

According to the American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR), \"Mental Retardation is characterized by significantly subaverage intellectual functioning\" [AAMR92, page 5]. The AAMR has recommended that people scoring below two Standard Deviations (SD) in a standardized IQ test be classified as retarded [AAMR92, page 5]. These tests are normalized to a mean of 100 with a SD of 15 . Those with scores below 50 are considered severly retarded. Scores in the category of $50-69$ fall in the classification of Mild Mental Retardation (MMR). Though AAMR suggests inclusion of limitation of adaptive skills also [AAMR92, page 6], many studies have used cognitive tests (IQ scores) for classification [StSu92], [McDe93]. A category called Borderline Mental Retardation (BMR)-scores falling between one and two standard deviations, was in vogue previously. But due to the social stigma attached to MR and concerns about test errors, it was de-emphasized subsequently. We shall go by IQ scores and keep the category of BMR for understanding causal mechanisms. For severe MR a cause can be found in the majority of cases. In MMR, which forms $85 %$ of MR, a cause cannot be put down in half the cases [Bats 93 ]. So here we have a complex web of unknown causal mechanisms, disagreement among experts, controversies (the large literature of nature versus nurture) and serious gaps in the experts\u2019 understanding of the etiological factors.",

This approach applies to independent variables of all scale types (binary, categorical, ordered categorical, and continuous) and to noisy as well as to noiseless training sets. It produces classification trees that can readily be reexpressed as sets of expert systems rules (with each conjunction of literals corresponding to a set of values for variables along one branch through the tree). Each such rule produces a probability vector for the possible classes (or dependent variable values) that the object being classified may have, thus automatically presenting confidence and uncertainty information about its conclusions. Classification trees can be validated by methods such as cross-validation (Breiman et al., 1984), and they can easily be modified to handle missing data by constructing rules that exploit only the information contained in the observed variables.",

This approach applies to independent variables of all scale types (binary, categorical, ordered categorical, and continuous) and to noisy as well as to noiseless training sets. It produces classification trees that can readily be reexpressed as sets of expert systems rules (with each conjunction of literals corresponding to a set of values for variables along one branch through the tree). Each such rule produces a probability vector for the possible classes (or dependent variable values) that the object being classified may have, thus automatically presenting confidence and uncertainty information about its conclusions. Classification trees can be validated by methods such as cross-validation (Breiman et al., 1984), and they can easily be modified to handle missing data by constructing rules that exploit only the information contained in the observed variables.},\n  note =         {Reissued by PMLR on 01 May 2022.}\n}",

What has struck us is the casual manner comparisons are typically carried out in the literature. The ranking of $k$ preselected methods is performed by training (estimating in statistical terminology) them on a single data set, and estimating their respective mean prediction errors (MPE) from a hold-out sample. The methods are, subsequently, ranked according to their estimated MPEs. When the total number of observations is small, usually cross-validation rather than a hold-out sample is used to estimate the mean prediction errors.  A more rigourous comparison of methods should include significance testing rather than giving a mere ranking based on the estimated MPEs. The statistical analysis of comparative studies, method ranking in particular, is addressed in this paper.
