Unusually, the patterns we consider are defined by large-scale properties of an underlying function that we can only observe at a limited number of points. Given a description of the desired patterns (in the form of a classifier taking functional inputs), we sequentially decide where to query function values to identify as many regions matching the pattern as possible, with high confience.  For one broad class of models the expected reward of each unobserved point can be computed analytically.  We demonstrate the proposed algorithm on three difficult search problems: locating polluted regions in a lake via mobile sensors, forecasting winning electoral districts with minimal polling, and identifying vortices in a fluid flow simulation.",

Unusually, the patterns we consider are defined by large-scale properties of an underlying function that we can only observe at a limited number of points. Given a description of the desired patterns (in the form of a classifier taking functional inputs), we sequentially decide where to query function values to identify as many regions matching the pattern as possible, with high confience.  For one broad class of models the expected reward of each unobserved point can be computed analytically.  We demonstrate the proposed algorithm on three difficult search problems: locating polluted regions in a lake via mobile sensors, forecasting winning electoral districts with minimal polling, and identifying vortices in a fluid flow simulation.}\n}",

        "abstract": "MART, an ensemble model of boosted regression trees, is known to deliver high prediction accuracy for diverse tasks, and is widely used in practice. However, it suffers an issue which we call over-specialization, wherein trees added at later iterations tend to impact the prediction of only a few instances, and make negligible contribution towards the remaining instances. This negatively affects the performance of the model on unseen data, and also makes the model over-sensitive to the contributions of the few, initially added tress. We show that the commonly used tool to address this issue, that of shrinkage, alleviates the problem only to a certain extent and the fundamental issue of over-specialization still remains.   In this work, we explore a different approach to address the problem, that of employing dropouts, a tool that has been recently proposed in the context of learning deep neural networks. We propose a novel way of employing dropouts to tackle the issue of over-specialization in MART, resulting in the DART algorithm. We evaluate DART on ranking, regression and classification tasks, using large scale, publicly available datasets, and show that DART outperforms MART in each of the tasks, with a significant margin.",

In this paper we propose a variation of the MH algorithm based on group moves, where the next state is obtained by first choosing a random transformation of the state space and then applying this transformation to the current state. This adds much-needed flexibility to the \"textbook\" MH algorithm where all measures involved must be given in terms of densities with respect to a common reference measure. Under mild conditions, our main result extends the acceptance probability formula of the textbook algorithm to MH algorithms with group moves. We work out how the new algorithms can be used to exploit a problem\u2019s natural symmetries and apply the technique to the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem, obtaining the first fully rigorous justification of a previous MCMC-based SLAM method. New experimental results comparing our method to existing state-of-the-art specialized methods on a standard range-only SLAM benchmark problem validate the strength of the approach.",

In this paper we propose a variation of the MH algorithm based on group moves, where the next state is obtained by first choosing a random transformation of the state space and then applying this transformation to the current state. This adds much-needed flexibility to the \"textbook\" MH algorithm where all measures involved must be given in terms of densities with respect to a common reference measure. Under mild conditions, our main result extends the acceptance probability formula of the textbook algorithm to MH algorithms with group moves. We work out how the new algorithms can be used to exploit a problem\u2019s natural symmetries and apply the technique to the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem, obtaining the first fully rigorous justification of a previous MCMC-based SLAM method. New experimental results comparing our method to existing state-of-the-art specialized methods on a standard range-only SLAM benchmark problem validate the strength of the approach.}\n}",

        "author": "Mingyuan Zhou",
        "abstract": "A hierarchical gamma process infinite edge partition model is proposed to factorize the binary adjacency matrix of an unweighted undirected relational network under a  Bernoulli-Poisson link. The model describes  both homophily and stochastic equivalence, and is scalable to  big sparse networks by focusing its computation on  pairs of linked nodes. It can not only discover overlapping communities and inter-community interactions, but also predict missing edges.

In practical applications, we are always confronted with the challenge of model selection, i.e., how to appropriately set the number of topics.  Following the recent advances in topic models  via tensor decomposition, we make a first attempt to provide theoretical analysis on model selection in latent Dirichlet allocation. With mild conditions, we derive the upper bound and lower bound on the number of topics given a text collection of finite size. Experimental results demonstrate that our bounds are correct and tight. Furthermore, using Gaussian mixture model as an example, we show that our methodology can be easily generalized to model selection analysis in other latent models.",

In practical applications, we are always confronted with the challenge of model selection, i.e., how to appropriately set the number of topics.  Following the recent advances in topic models  via tensor decomposition, we make a first attempt to provide theoretical analysis on model selection in latent Dirichlet allocation. With mild conditions, we derive the upper bound and lower bound on the number of topics given a text collection of finite size. Experimental results demonstrate that our bounds are correct and tight. Furthermore, using Gaussian mixture model as an example, we show that our methodology can be easily generalized to model selection analysis in other latent models.}\n}",

        "abstract": "Learning how to rank multivariate unlabeled observations depending on their degree of abnormality/novelty is a crucial problem in a wide range of applications. In practice, it generally consists in building a real valued \"scoring\" function on the feature space so as to quantify to which extent observations should be considered as abnormal.  In the 1-d situation, measurements are generally considered as \u201dabnormal\u201d when they are remote from central measures such as the mean or the median. Anomaly detection then relies on tail analysis of the variable of interest.

In the 1-d situation, measurements are generally considered as \u201dabnormal\u201d when they are remote from central measures such as the mean or the median.

We present a fully adaptive method that competes with dynamic benchmarks in which regret guarantee scales with regularity of the sequence of cost functions and comparators. Notably, the regret bound adapts to the smaller complexity measure in the problem environment. Finally, we apply our results to drifting zero-sum, two-player games where both players achieve no regret guarantees against best sequences of actions in hindsight.}\n}",

        "abstract": "Predictive inverse optimal control is a powerful approach for estimating the control policy of an agent from observed control demonstrations. Its usefulness has been established in a number of large-scale sequential decision settings characterized by complete state observability. However, many real decisions are made in situations where the state is not fully known to the agent making decisions. Though extensions of predictive inverse optimal control to partially observable Markov decision processes have been developed, their applicability has been limited by the complexities of inference in those representations. In this work, we extend predictive inverse optimal control to the linear- quadratic-Gaussian control setting. We establish close connections between optimal control laws for this setting and the probabilistic predictions under our approach.

Its usefulness has been established in a number of large-scale sequential decision settings characterized by complete state observability. However, many real decisions are made in situations where the state is not fully known to the agent making decisions. Though extensions of predictive inverse optimal control to partially observable Markov decision processes have been developed, their applicability has been limited by the complexities of inference in those representations. In this work, we extend predictive inverse optimal control to the linear- quadratic-Gaussian control setting. We establish close connections between optimal control laws for this setting and the probabilistic predictions under our approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness and benefit in estimating control policies that are influenced by partial observability on both synthetic and real datasets.}\n}",

Our experiments on real-world high-dimensional datasets demonstrate its potential for classification, dimensionality reduction and data exploration.}\n}",

This generalizes the idea of trend filtering (Kim et al., 2009, Tibshirani, 2014) used for univariate nonparametric regression, to graphs. Analogous to the univariate case, graph trend filtering exhibits a level of local adaptivity unmatched by the usual \\ell_2-based graph smoothers.

Although there exist a large number of similarity measures between distributions, very little is known about their generalization performance in specific learning tasks. Learning problems formulated on distributions have an inherent two-stage sampled difficulty: in practice only samples from sampled distributions are observable, and one has to build an estimate on similarities computed between sets of points. To the best of our knowledge, the only existing method with consistency guarantees for distribution regression requires kernel density estimation as an intermediate step (which suffers from slow convergence issues in high dimensions), and the domain of the distributions to be compact Euclidean. In this paper, we provide theoretical guarantees for a remarkably simple algorithmic alternative to solve the distribution regression problem: embed the distributions to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and learn a ridge regressor from the embeddings to the outputs. Our main contribution is to prove the consistency of this technique in the two-stage sampled setting under mild conditions (on separable, topological domains endowed with kernels). As a special case, we answer a 15-year-old open question: we establish the consistency of the classical set kernel [Haussler, 1999; Gaertner et. al, 2002] in regression, and cover more recent kernels on distributions, including those due to [Christmann and Steinwart, 2010].",

However, it is well-established that in the high-dimensional setting (p > N) the underlying projection estimator degenerates. Moreover, any linear discriminate function involving a large number of features may be difficult to interpret. To ameliorate these issues, two general categories of sparse LDA modifications have been proposed, both to reduce the number of active features and to stabilize the resulting projections. The first, based on optimal scoring, is more straightforward to implement and analyze but has been heavily criticized for its ambiguous connection with the original LDA formulation.

In all cases the choice of sparse regularizer can be important, but no rigorous guidelines have been provided regarding which penalty might be preferable. Against this backdrop, we winnow down the broad space of candidate sparse LDA algorithms and promote a specific selection based on optimal scoring coupled with a particular, complementary sparse regularizer.
