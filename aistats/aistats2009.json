Its bottom layer of hierarchy consists of multiple hierarchical Pitman-Yor process language models, one each for some number of domains. The novel top layer of hierarchy consists of a mechanism to couple together multiple language models such that they share statistical strength. Intuitively this sharing results in the \u201cadaptation\u201d of a latent shared language model to each domain. We introduce a general formalism capable of describing the overall model which we call the graphical Pitman-Yor process and explain how to perform Bayesian inference in it. We present encouraging language model domain adaptation results that both illustrate the potential benefits of our new model and suggest new avenues of inquiry.",

The key idea is to  construct two kernel matrices for the given training data: one is  based on the distance metric and the other is based on the assigned  class labels. Inspired by the idea of information geometry, we  relate these two kernel matrices to two Gaussian distributions, and  the difference between the two kernel matrices is then computed by  the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the two Gaussian  distributions. The optimal distance metric is then found by  minimizing the divergence between the two distributions. Based on  this idea, we present two metric learning algorithms, one for linear  distance metric and the other for nonlinear distance with the  introduction of a kernel function. Unlike many existing algorithms  for metric learning that require solving a non-trivial optimization  problem and therefore are computationally expensive when the data  dimension is high, the proposed algorithms have a closed-form  solution and are computationally more efficient. Extensive  experiments with data classification and face recognition show that  the proposed algorithms are comparable to or better than the  state-of-the-art algorithms for metric learning.",

The problem is often treated as a regression task where the goal is to find a low dimensional representation of the input data that preserves the statistical correlation with the targets.

COIR addresses known limitations of recent DRR techniques and allows a closed-form solution without resorting to explicit output space slicing often required by existing IR-based methods. In this work we provide a unifying view of COIR and other DRR techniques and relate them to the popular supervised dimensionality reduction methods including the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and the linear discriminant analysis (LDA). We then show that COIR can be effectively extended to a semi-supervised learning setting where many of the input points lack their corresponding multivariate targets.

Competitive imperfect information games where the goal is to maximally exploit an unknown opponent\u2019s weaknesses are an example of this problem.

Second, they should aim to minimize losses since the limited data may be misleading or the opponent\u2019s strategy may have changed, suggesting an opponent-agnostic Nash equilibrium strategy.  In this paper, we show how to partially satisfy both of these objectives at the same time, producing strategies with favorable tradeoffs between the ability to exploit an opponent and the capacity to be exploited.

In addition, we also show that GNMF is useful  in a task of subject-to-subject transfer where the prediction for an unseen subject  is performed based on a linear model learned from different subjects in the same group.}\n}",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel learning algorithm for structured classification problems, where the task is to predict multiple and interacting labels (multilabel) for an input object. The maximum margin separation between the correct multilabels and the incorrect ones is formulated as a linear program.  Instead of explicitly writing out the entire problem with an exponentially large  constraint set, the linear program is solved iteratively via column generation. In this case, the process of generating most violated constraints is equivalent to searching for highest-scored misclassified incorrect multilabels, which can be easily achieved by decoding the structure based on current estimations.  In addition, we also explore the integration of the column generation and the extragradient method for linear programming to gain further efficiency. Compared to previous works on large-margin structured prediction, this framework has advantages in handling arbitrary structures and larger-scale  problems. Experimental results on part-of-speech tagging and statistical machine translation tasks are reported, demonstrating the competitiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Learning the sparse structure of a general  Markov network is a hard problem. One of the  main difficulties is the computation of its generally  intractable partition function. To circumvent  this difficulty, this paper proposes to learn  the network structure using an ensemble-of-trees  (ET) model. The ET model was first introduced  by Meila and Jaakkola [1], and it approximates  a Markov network using a mixture of all possible  (super-exponentially many) spanning trees.  The advantage of the ET model is that, although  it needs to sum over super-exponentially many  trees, its partition function as well as data likelihood  can be computed in a closed form. Furthermore,  since the ET model tends to represent  a Markov network using as small number  of trees as possible, it provides a natural regularization  for finding a sparse network structure.  Our simulation results show that the proposed  ET approach is able to accurately recover  the true Markov network connectivity and significantly  outperform the state-of-art approaches  for both discrete and continuous random variable  networks. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the  usage of the ET model for discovering the network  of words from blog posts.",

General sufficient conditions for the AUC consistency of scoring functions that are constant on cells of a partition of the feature space are provided.

We verify the  usefulness of this approach by comparing against classical models  on applications to modeling amino acid fluorescence, collaborative  filtering and a number of benchmark multiway array data.}\n}",

        "abstract": "Many classification problems with structured outputs can be regarded as a set of interrelated sub-problems where constraints  dictate valid variable assignments.  The standard approaches to these problems include either independent learning of individual classifiers for each of the sub-problems or joint learning of the entire set of classifiers with the constraints enforced during learning.  We propose an intermediate approach where we learn these classifiers in a sequence using previously learned classifiers to guide learning of the next classifier by enforcing constraints between their outputs. We provide a theoretical motivation to explain why this learning protocol is expected to outperform both alternatives when individual problems have different \u2018complexity\u2019.

The standard approaches to these problems include either independent learning of individual classifiers for each of the sub-problems or joint learning of the entire set of classifiers with the constraints enforced during learning.  We propose an intermediate approach where we learn these classifiers in a sequence using previously learned classifiers to guide learning of the next classifier by enforcing constraints between their outputs. We provide a theoretical motivation to explain why this learning protocol is expected to outperform both alternatives when individual problems have different \u2018complexity\u2019.

Technically this reduces to learning a probabilistic, input conditional model, over latent (manifold) and output variables using an alternation scheme. In one round, we optimize the parameters of an input-driven manifold predictor using latent targets given by preimages (conditional expectations) of the current manifold-to-output model. In the next round, we use the distribution given by the manifold predictor in order to maximize the probability of the outputs with an additional, implicit distance preserving constraint on the manifold. The resulting Supervised Spectral Latent Variable Model (SSLVM) combines the properties of probabilistic geometric manifold learning (accommodates geometric constraints corresponding to any spectral embedding method including PCA, ISOMAP or Laplacian Eigenmaps), with the additional supervisory information to further constrain it for predictive tasks.

Unfortunately, like in many statistical models, exact inference in a DPM is intractable, and  approximate methods are needed to perform efficient inference. While most attention in the literature has been placed on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), variational Bayesian (VB) and collapsed variational methods, Heller and Ghahramani (2005) recently introduced a novel class of approximation for DPMs based on Bayesian hierarchical clustering (BHC). These tree-based combinatorial approximations efficiently sum over exponentially many ways of partitioning the data and offer a novel lower bound on the marginal likelihood of the DPM. In this paper we make the following contributions: (1) We show empirically that the BHC lower bounds are substantially tighter than the bounds given by VB and by collapsed variational methods on synthetic and real datasets. (2) We also show that BHC offers a more accurate predictive performance on these datasets. (3) We further improve the tree-based lower bounds with an algorithm that efficiently sums contributions from alternative trees. (4) We present a fast approximate method for BHC. Our results suggest that our combinatorial approximate inference methods and lower bounds may be useful not only in DPMs but in other models as well.",

        "abstract": "Comprehensive visualization that preserves the information in a large complex dataset requires a visualization database (VDB): many displays, some with many pages, and with one or more panels per page. A single display using a specific display method results from partitioning the data into subsets, sampling the subsets, and applying the method to each sample, typically one per panel. The time of the analyst to generate a display is not increased by choosing a large sample over a small one. Displays and display viewers can be designed to allow rapid scanning.

A single display using a specific display method results from partitioning the data into subsets, sampling the subsets, and applying the method to each sample, typically one per panel. The time of the analyst to generate a display is not increased by choosing a large sample over a small one. Displays and display viewers can be designed to allow rapid scanning. Often, it is not necessary to view every page of a display. VDBs, already successful just with off-the-shelf tools, can be greatly improved by research that rethinks all of the areas of data visualization in the context of VDBs.}\n}",
