        "abstract": "Distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) extends the value-based approach by approximating the full distribution over future returns instead of the mean only, providing a richer signal that leads to improved performances. Quantile Regression (QR)-based methods like QR-DQN project arbitrary distributions into a parametric subset of staircase distributions by minimizing the 1-Wasserstein distance. However, due to biases in the gradients, the quantile regression loss is used instead for training, guaranteeing the same minimizer and enjoying unbiased gradients. Non-crossing constraints on the quantiles have been shown to improve the performance of QR-DQN for uncertainty-based exploration strategies. The contribution of this work is in the setting of fixed quantile levels and is twofold. First, we prove that the Cramer distance yields a projection that coincides with the 1-Wasserstein one and that, under non-crossing constraints, the squared Cramer and the quantile regression losses yield collinear gradients, shedding light on the connection between these important elements of DRL.

Quantile Regression (QR)-based methods like QR-DQN project arbitrary distributions into a parametric subset of staircase distributions by minimizing the 1-Wasserstein distance. However, due to biases in the gradients, the quantile regression loss is used instead for training, guaranteeing the same minimizer and enjoying unbiased gradients. Non-crossing constraints on the quantiles have been shown to improve the performance of QR-DQN for uncertainty-based exploration strategies. The contribution of this work is in the setting of fixed quantile levels and is twofold. First, we prove that the Cramer distance yields a projection that coincides with the 1-Wasserstein one and that, under non-crossing constraints, the squared Cramer and the quantile regression losses yield collinear gradients, shedding light on the connection between these important elements of DRL. Second, we propose a low complexity algorithm to compute the Cramer distance. }\n}",

These methods typically employ a nonparametric prior on the survival function that is conjugate with respect to right-censored data. Eliciting these priors, particularly in the presence of covariates, can be challenging and inference typically relies on computationally intensive Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes. In this paper, we build on recent work that recasts Bayesian inference as assigning a predictive distribution on the unseen values of a population conditional on the observed samples, thus avoiding the need to specify a complex prior. We describe a copula-based predictive update which admits a scalable sequential importance sampling algorithm to perform inference that properly accounts for right-censoring.

Such problem can be formulated as a quadratic combinatorial optimization problem over the boolean hypercube, where it has been shown before that one can (with high probability and in polynomial time) exactly recover the ground-truth labeling of graphs that have an isoperimetric number that grows with respect to the number of nodes (e.g., complete graphs, regular expanders).

Motivated by empirical evidence on the improvement in exact recoverability, we center our attention on the degree-4 SoS relaxation and set out to understand the origin of such improvement from a graph theoretical perspective. We show that the solution of the dual of the relaxed problem is related to finding edge weights of the Johnson and Kneser graphs, where the weights fulfill the SoS constraints and intuitively allow the input graph to increase its algebraic connectivity.

Our method is motivated by the convex analysis perspective of distributionally robust optimization based on probability metrics, such as the Wasserstein distance and the maximum mean discrepancy. We adapt the integral operator using supremal convolution in convex analysis to form a novel function majorant used for enforcing robustness. Our method is simple in form and applies to general loss functions and machine learning models. Exploiting a connection with optimal transport, we prove theoretical guarantees for certified robustness under distribution shift.

In addition to characterizing theoretical limits of NN compression, this formulation shows that pruning, implicitly or explicitly, must be a part of a good compression algorithm. This observation bridges a gap between parts of the literature pertaining to NN and data compression, respectively, providing insight into the empirical success of pruning for NN compression. Finally, we propose a novel pruning strategy derived from our information-theoretic formulation and show that it outperforms the relevant baselines on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets.",

In addition to characterizing theoretical limits of NN compression, this formulation shows that pruning, implicitly or explicitly, must be a part of a good compression algorithm. This observation bridges a gap between parts of the literature pertaining to NN and data compression, respectively, providing insight into the empirical success of pruning for NN compression. Finally, we propose a novel pruning strategy derived from our information-theoretic formulation and show that it outperforms the relevant baselines on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. }\n}",

In this paper, we propose a novel differential network estimator that allows integrating various sources of knowledge beyond data samples. The proposed estimator is scalable to a large number of variables and achieves a sharp asymptotic convergence rate.

Recently, many MDTC methods adopt adversarial learning, shared-private paradigm, and entropy minimization to yield state-of-the-art results. However, these approaches face three issues: (1) Minimizing domain divergence can not fully guarantee the success of domain alignment; (2) Aligning marginal feature distributions can not fully guarantee the discriminability of the learned features; (3) Standard entropy minimization may make the predictions on unlabeled data over-confident, deteriorating the discriminability of the learned features.

        "abstract": "Learning with simulators is ubiquitous in mod-ern reinforcement learning (RL). The simulatorcan either correspond to a simplified version ofthe real environment (such as a physics simulation of a robot arm) or to the environment itself (such as in games like Atari and Go). Among algorithms that are provably sample-efficient in this setting, most make the unrealistic assumption that all possible environment states are known before learning begins, or perform global optimistic planning which is computationally inefficient. In this work, we focus on simulation-based RL under a more realistic local access protocol, where the state space is unknown and the simulator can only be queried at states that have previously been observed (initial states and those returned by previous queries). We propose an algorithm named CONFIDENT-LSVI based on the template of least-square value iteration.

The simulatorcan either correspond to a simplified version ofthe real environment (such as a physics simulation of a robot arm) or to the environment itself (such as in games like Atari and Go). Among algorithms that are provably sample-efficient in this setting, most make the unrealistic assumption that all possible environment states are known before learning begins, or perform global optimistic planning which is computationally inefficient. In this work, we focus on simulation-based RL under a more realistic local access protocol, where the state space is unknown and the simulator can only be queried at states that have previously been observed (initial states and those returned by previous queries). We propose an algorithm named CONFIDENT-LSVI based on the template of least-square value iteration. CONFIDENT-LSVI incrementally builds a coreset of important states and uses the simulator to revisit them. Assuming that the linear function class has low approximation error under the Bell-man optimality operator (a.k.a. low inherent Bell-man error), we bound the algorithm performance in terms of this error, and show that it is query-and computationally-efficient. }\n}",

Crucially, the learned time scores can then be integrated to compute the desired density ratio. In addition, we show that traditional (Stein) scores can be used to obtain integration paths that connect regions of high density in both distributions, improving performance in practice. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach performs well on downstream tasks such as mutual information estimation and energy-based modeling on complex, high-dimensional datasets. }\n}",

This class of algorithms is widely applied in robotics with movement primitives or non-differentiable policies. Furthermore, these approaches are particularly relevant where exploration at the action level could cause actuator damage or other safety issues. However, Black-box optimization does not scale well with the increasing dimensionality of the policy, leading to high demand for samples, which are expensive to obtain in real-world systems. In many practical applications, policy parameters do not contribute equally to the return. Identifying the most relevant parameters allows to narrow down the exploration and speed up the learning. Furthermore, updating only the effective parameters requires fewer samples, improving the scalability of the method. We present a novel method to prioritize the exploration of effective parameters and cope with full covariance matrix updates. Our algorithm learns faster than recent approaches and requires fewer samples to achieve state-of-the-art results. To select the effective parameters, we consider both the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Mutual Information.

In this work, we combine and expand previously published results in a theoretically sound framework that describes the relationship between diversity and ensemble performance for a wide range of ensemble methods. More precisely, we provide sound answers to the following questions: how to measure diversity, how diversity relates to the generalization error of an ensemble, and how diversity is promoted by neural network ensemble algorithms. This analysis covers three widely used loss functions, namely, the squared loss, the cross-entropy loss, and the 0-1 loss; and two widely used model combination strategies, namely, model averaging and weighted majority vote.

We propose an adaptive nonlinear feature selection method, which is based on the HSIC Lasso, that uses a stochastic model with a family of super-Gaussian prior distributions for sparsity enhancement. The method includes easily implementable closed-form update equations that are derived approximately from variational inference and can handle high-dimensional and large datasets. We applied the method to several synthetic datasets and real-world datasets and verified its effectiveness regarding redundancy, computational complexity, and classification and prediction accuracy using the selected features. The results indicate that the method can more effectively remove irrelevant features, leaving only relevant features.

We propose an adaptive nonlinear feature selection method, which is based on the HSIC Lasso, that uses a stochastic model with a family of super-Gaussian prior distributions for sparsity enhancement. The method includes easily implementable closed-form update equations that are derived approximately from variational inference and can handle high-dimensional and large datasets. We applied the method to several synthetic datasets and real-world datasets and verified its effectiveness regarding redundancy, computational complexity, and classification and prediction accuracy using the selected features. The results indicate that the method can more effectively remove irrelevant features, leaving only relevant features.

Current state-of-the-art algorithms to compute such volumes rely on efficient sampling of a Gaussian distribution restricted to the polytope, using e.g. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We present a new sampling strategy that uses a Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process. Like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, this new method involves simulating trajectories of a non-reversible process and inherits similar good mixing properties. However, importantly, the process can be simulated more easily due to its piecewise linear trajectories \u2013 and this leads to a reduction of the computational cost by a factor of the dimension of the space. Our experiments indicate that our method is numerically robust and is one order of magnitude faster (or better) than existing methods using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.

Current state-of-the-art algorithms to compute such volumes rely on efficient sampling of a Gaussian distribution restricted to the polytope, using e.g. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We present a new sampling strategy that uses a Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process. Like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, this new method involves simulating trajectories of a non-reversible process and inherits similar good mixing properties. However, importantly, the process can be simulated more easily due to its piecewise linear trajectories \u2013 and this leads to a reduction of the computational cost by a factor of the dimension of the space. Our experiments indicate that our method is numerically robust and is one order of magnitude faster (or better) than existing methods using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.

Most learning tasks have intrinsic symmetries, i.e., the input transformations leave the output unchanged, or the output undergoes a similar transformation. The learning process is, however, usually uninformed of these symmetries. Therefore, the learned representations for individually transformed inputs may not be meaningfully related. In this paper, we propose an SO(3) equivariant deep dynamical model (EqDDM) for motion prediction that learns a structured representation of the input space in the sense that the embedding varies with symmetry transformations.

We then derive upper bounds between the solutions output by counterfactual explanation and adversarial example generation methods, which we validate on several real world data sets. By establishing these theoretical and empirical similarities between counterfactual explanations and adversarial examples, our work raises fundamental questions about the design and development of existing counterfactual explanation algorithms. }\n}",

        "abstract": "Scalability and privacy are two critical concerns for cross-device federated learning (FL) systems. In this work, we identify that synchronous FL \u2013 cannot scale efficiently beyond a few hundred clients training in parallel. It leads to diminishing returns in model performance and training speed, analogous to large-batch training. On the other hand, asynchronous aggregation of client updates in FL (i.e., asynchronous FL) alleviates the scalability issue.

        "author": "Khaled Eldowa; Lorenzo Bisi; Marcello Restelli",
        "abstract": "The goal in the standard reinforcement learning problem is to find a policy that optimizes the expected return. However, such an objective is not adequate in a lot of real-life applications, like finance, where controlling the uncertainty of the outcome is imperative. The mean-volatility objective penalizes, through a tunable parameter, policies with high variance of the per-step reward. An interesting property of this objective is that it admits simple linear Bellman equations that resemble, up to a reward transformation, those of the risk-neutral case. However, the required reward transformation is policy-dependent, and requires the (usually unknown) expected return of the used policy. In this work, we propose two general methods for policy evaluation under the mean-volatility objective: the direct method and the factored method.

However, such an objective is not adequate in a lot of real-life applications, like finance, where controlling the uncertainty of the outcome is imperative. The mean-volatility objective penalizes, through a tunable parameter, policies with high variance of the per-step reward. An interesting property of this objective is that it admits simple linear Bellman equations that resemble, up to a reward transformation, those of the risk-neutral case. However, the required reward transformation is policy-dependent, and requires the (usually unknown) expected return of the used policy. In this work, we propose two general methods for policy evaluation under the mean-volatility objective: the direct method and the factored method. We then extend recent results for finite sample analysis in the risk-neutral actor-critic setting to the mean-volatility case. Our analysis shows that the sample complexity to attain an $\\epsilon$-accurate stationary point is the same as that of the risk-neutral version, using either policy evaluation method for training the critic.

Motivated by physical considerations, we consider a generalized setting that includes as special cases multiple other group-testing-like models in the literature. In our setting, which subsumes as special cases a variety of noiseless and noisy group-testing models in the literature, the test outcome is positive with probability $f(x)$, where $x$ is the number of defectives tested in a pool, and $f(\\cdot)$ is an arbitrary {\\it monotonically increasing} (stochastic) test function. Our main contributions are as follows. 1. We present a non-adaptive scheme that with probability $1-\\varepsilon$ identifies all defective items. Our scheme requires at most ${\\cal O}( H(f) d\\log(n/\\varepsilon))$ tests, where $H(f)$ is a suitably defined \u201csensitivity parameter\" of $f(\\cdot)$, and is never larger than ${\\cal O}(d^{1+o(1)})$, but may be substantially smaller for many $f(\\cdot)$. 2. We argue that any non-adaptive group testing scheme needs at least $\\Omega (h(f) d\\log(n/d))$ tests to ensure high reliability recovery. Here $h(f)$ is a suitably defined \u201cconcentration parameter\" of $f(\\cdot)$, and $h(f) \\in \\Omega{(1)}$. 3. We prove that our sample-complexity bounds for generalized group testing are information-theoretically near-optimal for a variety of sparse-recovery group-testing models in the literature. That is, for {\\it any} \u201cnoisy\" test function $f(\\cdot)$ (i.e. $0< f(0) < f(d) <1$), and for a variety of \u201c(one-sided) noiseless\" test functions $f(\\cdot)$ (i.e., either $f(0)=0$, or $f(d)=1$, or both) studied in the literature we show that $H(f)/h(f) \\in \\Theta(1)$. As a by-product we tightly characterize the heretofore open information-theoretic sample-complexity for the well-studied model of threshold group-testing. For general (near)-noiseless test functions $f(\\cdot)$ we show that $H(f)/h(f) \\in {\\cal O}(d^{1+o(1)})$. We also demonstrate a \u201cnatural\" test-function $f(\\cdot)$ whose sample complexity scales \u201cextremally\" as $\\Theta ( d^2\\log(n))$, rather than $\\Theta ( d\\log(n))$ as in the case of classical group-testing. Some of our techniques may be of independent interest \u2013 in particular our achievability requires a delicate saddle-point approximation, and our impossibility proof relies on a novel bound relating the mutual information of pair of random variables with the mean and variance of a specific function, and we derive novel structural results about monotone functions.",

We argue that any non-adaptive group testing scheme needs at least $\\Omega (h(f) d\\log(n/d))$ tests to ensure high reliability recovery. Here $h(f)$ is a suitably defined \u201cconcentration parameter\" of $f(\\cdot)$, and $h(f) \\in \\Omega{(1)}$. 3. We prove that our sample-complexity bounds for generalized group testing are information-theoretically near-optimal for a variety of sparse-recovery group-testing models in the literature. That is, for {\\it any} \u201cnoisy\" test function $f(\\cdot)$ (i.e. $0< f(0) < f(d) <1$), and for a variety of \u201c(one-sided) noiseless\" test functions $f(\\cdot)$ (i.e., either $f(0)=0$, or $f(d)=1$, or both) studied in the literature we show that $H(f)/h(f) \\in \\Theta(1)$. As a by-product we tightly characterize the heretofore open information-theoretic sample-complexity for the well-studied model of threshold group-testing. For general (near)-noiseless test functions $f(\\cdot)$ we show that $H(f)/h(f) \\in {\\cal O}(d^{1+o(1)})$. We also demonstrate a \u201cnatural\" test-function $f(\\cdot)$ whose sample complexity scales \u201cextremally\" as $\\Theta ( d^2\\log(n))$, rather than $\\Theta ( d\\log(n))$ as in the case of classical group-testing. Some of our techniques may be of independent interest \u2013 in particular our achievability requires a delicate saddle-point approximation, and our impossibility proof relies on a novel bound relating the mutual information of pair of random variables with the mean and variance of a specific function, and we derive novel structural results about monotone functions. }\n}",

We provide a unified view of all these problems, as learning to act in a hierarchical Bayesian bandit. We propose and analyze a natural hierarchical Thompson sampling algorithm (HierTS) for this class of problems. Our regret bounds hold for many variants of the problems, including when the tasks are solved sequentially or in parallel; and show that the regret decreases with a more informative prior. Our proofs rely on a novel total variance decomposition that can be applied beyond our models.

An open problem is to identify the causal parameters from correlations between the nodes. We investigate models, whose directed component forms a tree, and show that there, besides classical instrumental variables, missing cycles of bidirected edges can be used to identify the model. They can yield systems of quadratic equations that we explicitly solve to obtain one or two solutions for the causal parameters of adjacent directed edges. We show how multiple missing cycles can be combined to obtain a unique solution.

Widely used meta learning methods include model agnostic meta learning (MAML), implicit MAML, Bayesian MAML. Thanks to its ability of modeling uncertainty, Bayesian MAML often has advantageous empirical performance. However, the theoretical understanding of Bayesian MAML is still limited, especially on questions such as if and when Bayesian MAML has provably better performance than MAML. In this paper, we aim to provide theoretical justifications for Bayesian MAML\u2019s advantageous performance by comparing the meta test risks of MAML and Bayesian MAML.

However, energy-based regression requires a proposal distribution to be manually designed for training, and an initial estimate has to be provided at test-time. We address both of these issues by introducing a conceptually simple method to automatically learn an effective proposal distribution, which is parameterized by a separate network head. To this end, we derive a surprising result, leading to a unified training objective that jointly minimizes the KL divergence from the proposal to the EBM, and the negative log-likelihood of the EBM. At test-time, we can then employ importance sampling with the trained proposal to efficiently evaluate the learned EBM and produce stand-alone predictions. Furthermore, we utilize our derived training objective to learn mixture density networks (MDNs) with a jointly trained energy-based teacher, consistently outperforming conventional MDN training on four real-world regression tasks within computer vision.

All the existing positive results are limited to the case where $\\sigma$ is monotonic. However, it is recently observed that non-monotonic activation functions outperform the traditional monotonic ones in many applications. To fill this gap, we establish learnability without assuming monotonicity. Specifically, when the input distribution is the standard Gaussian, we show that mild conditions on $\\sigma$ (e.g., $\\sigma$ has a dominating linear part) are sufficient to guarantee the learnability in polynomial time and polynomial samples. Moreover, with a stronger assumption on the activation function, the condition of input distribution can be relaxed to a non-degeneracy of the marginal distribution. We remark that our conditions on $\\sigma$ are satisfied by practical non-monotonic activation functions, such as SiLU/Swish and GELU.

All the existing positive results are limited to the case where $\\sigma$ is monotonic. However, it is recently observed that non-monotonic activation functions outperform the traditional monotonic ones in many applications. To fill this gap, we establish learnability without assuming monotonicity. Specifically, when the input distribution is the standard Gaussian, we show that mild conditions on $\\sigma$ (e.g., $\\sigma$ has a dominating linear part) are sufficient to guarantee the learnability in polynomial time and polynomial samples. Moreover, with a stronger assumption on the activation function, the condition of input distribution can be relaxed to a non-degeneracy of the marginal distribution. We remark that our conditions on $\\sigma$ are satisfied by practical non-monotonic activation functions, such as SiLU/Swish and GELU. We also discuss how our positive results are related to existing negative results on training two-layer neural networks. }\n}",

Our analysis is performed across varying network and optimizer hyper-parameters, and involves a rich family of different sharpness measures. We compare these measures and show that the low-pass filter based measure exhibits the highest correlation with the generalization abilities of DL models, has high robustness to both data and label noise, and furthermore can track the double descent behavior for neural networks. We next derive the optimization algorithm, relying on the low-pass filter (LPF), that actively searches the flat regions in the DL optimization landscape using SGD-like procedure. The update of the proposed algorithm, that we call LPF-SGD, is determined by the gradient of the convolution of the filter kernel with the loss function and can be efficiently computed using MC sampling. We empirically show that our algorithm achieves superior generalization performance compared to the common DL training strategies. On the theoretical front we prove that LPF-SGD converges to a better optimal point with smaller generalization error than SGD.",

Existing approaches require likelihood evaluations of many kernels, rendering them prohibitively expensive for larger datasets. We propose a Bayesian Quadrature scheme to make this marginalisation more efficient and thereby more practical. Through use of maximum mean discrepancies between distributions, we define a kernel over kernels that captures invariances between Spectral Mixture (SM) Kernels.

We devise an online learning algorithm and provide guarantees on its expected regret. This regret at time $T$ is upper bounded (i) by $\\widetilde{O}((d_u+d_x)\\sqrt{d_xT})$ when $A$ and $B$ are unknown, (ii) by $\\widetilde{O}(d_x^2\\log(T))$ if only $A$ is unknown, and (iii) by $\\widetilde{O}(d_x(d_u+d_x)\\log(T))$ if only $B$ is unknown and under some mild non-degeneracy condition ($d_x$ and $d_u$ denote the dimensions of the state and of the control input, respectively). These regret scalings are minimal in $T$, $d_x$ and $d_u$ as they match existing lower bounds in scenario (i) when $d_x\\le d_u$ [SF20], and in scenario (ii) [Lai86]. We conjecture that our upper bounds are also optimal in scenario (iii) (there is no known lower bound in this setting). Existing online algorithms proceed in epochs of (typically exponentially) growing durations. The control policy is fixed within each epoch, which considerably simplifies the analysis of the estimation error on $A$ and $B$ and hence of the regret. Our algorithm departs from this design choice: it is a simple variant of certainty-equivalence regulators, where the estimates of $A$ and $B$ and the resulting control policy can be updated as frequently as we wish, possibly at every step. Quantifying the impact of such a constantly-varying control policy on the performance of these estimates and on the regret constitutes one of the technical challenges tackled in this paper.",

We propose a framework through which we can compute the bias of a particular estimator for an evaluation data set of a given size.

Previously, to estimate the modes, an iterative method has been proposed based on a Riemannian gradient estimator and empirically showed the superior performance in clustering (Ashizawa et al., 2017).

Although algorithms with alternating updates are commonly used in practice, the majority of existing theoretical analyses focus on simultaneous algorithms for convenience of analysis. In this paper, we study alternating gradient descent-ascent\u00a0(Alt-GDA) in minimax games and show that Alt-GDA is superior to its simultaneous counterpart\u00a0(Sim-GDA) in many settings. We prove that Alt-GDA achieves a near-optimal local convergence rate for strongly convex-strongly concave (SCSC) problems while Sim-GDA converges at a much slower rate. To our knowledge, this is the first result of any setting showing that Alt-GDA converges faster than Sim-GDA by more than a constant. We further adapt the theory of integral quadratic constraints (IQC) and show that Alt-GDA attains the same rate globally for a subclass of SCSC minimax problems.

Although algorithms with alternating updates are commonly used in practice, the majority of existing theoretical analyses focus on simultaneous algorithms for convenience of analysis. In this paper, we study alternating gradient descent-ascent\u00a0(Alt-GDA) in minimax games and show that Alt-GDA is superior to its simultaneous counterpart\u00a0(Sim-GDA) in many settings. We prove that Alt-GDA achieves a near-optimal local convergence rate for strongly convex-strongly concave (SCSC) problems while Sim-GDA converges at a much slower rate. To our knowledge, this is the first result of any setting showing that Alt-GDA converges faster than Sim-GDA by more than a constant. We further adapt the theory of integral quadratic constraints (IQC) and show that Alt-GDA attains the same rate globally for a subclass of SCSC minimax problems. Empirically, we demonstrate that alternating updates speed up GAN training significantly and the use of optimism only helps for simultaneous algorithms. }\n}",

We leverage these balancing scores to perform matching for high-dimensional causal inference and call this procedure neural score matching.

        "abstract": "Addressing such diverse ends as mitigating safety risks, aligning agent behavior with human preferences, and improving the efficiency of learning, an emerging line of reinforcement learning research addresses the entire distribution of returns and various risk functionals that depend upon it. In the contextual bandit setting, recently work on off-policy risk assessment estimates the target policy\u2019s CDF of returns, providing finite sample guarantees that extend to (and hold simultaneously over) plugin estimates of an arbitrarily large set of risk functionals. In this paper, we lift OPRA to Markov decision processes (MDPs), where importance sampling (IS) CDF estimators suffer high variance on longer trajectories due to vanishing (and exploding) importance weights.

In this paper, we lift OPRA to Markov decision processes (MDPs), where importance sampling (IS) CDF estimators suffer high variance on longer trajectories due to vanishing (and exploding) importance weights.

        "abstract": "It is well-known that deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to adversarial attacks, which presents the most severe fragility of the deep learning system. Despite achieving impressive performance, most of the current state-of-the-art classifiers remain highly vulnerable to carefully crafted imperceptible, adversarial perturbations. Recent research attempts to understand neural network attack and defense have become increasingly urgent and important. While rapid progress has been made on this front, there is still an important theoretical gap in achieving guaranteed bounds on attack/defense models, leaving uncertainty in the quality and certified guarantees of these models. To this end, we systematically address this problem in this paper. More specifically, we formulate attack and defense in a generic setting where there exists a family of adversaries (i.e., attackers) for attacking a family of classifiers (i.e., defenders). We develop a novel class of f-divergences suitable for measuring divergence among multiple distributions. This equips us to study the interactions between attackers and defenders in a countervailing game where we formulate a joint risk on attack and defense schemes. This is followed by our key results on guaranteed upper and lower bounds on this risk that can provide a better understanding of the behaviors of those parties from the attack and defense perspectives, thereby having important implications to both attack and defense sides. Finally, benefited from our theory, we propose an empirical approach that bases on a global view to defend against adversarial attacks. The experimental results conducted on benchmark datasets show that the global view for attack/defense if exploited appropriately can help to improve adversarial robustness.",

In this paper, we show that the Max-Margin loss can only be consistent to the classification task under highly restrictive assumptions on the discrete loss measuring the error between outputs. These conditions are satisfied by distances defined in tree graphs, for which we prove consistency, thus being the first losses shown to be consistent for Max-Margin beyond the binary setting. We finally address these limitations by correcting the concept of Max-Margin and introducing the Restricted-Max-Margin, where the maximization of the loss-augmented scores is maintained, but performed over a subset of the original domain.

Most previous works focus on single-item diffusion. In this paper, we introduce a new Online Competitive Influence Maximization (OCIM) problem, where two competing items (e.g., products, news stories) propagate in the same network and influence probabilities on edges are unknown. We adopt a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) framework for OCIM, but unlike the non-competitive setting, the important monotonicity property (influence spread increases when influence probabilities on edges increase) no longer holds due to the competitive nature of propagation, which brings a significant new challenge to the problem. We provide a nontrivial proof showing that the Triggering Probability Modulated (TPM) condition for CMAB still holds in OCIM, which is instrumental for our proposed algorithms OCIM-TS and OCIM-OFU to achieve sublinear Bayesian and frequentist regret, respectively.

We instead assume that each hypothesis requires an immediate preliminary decision, but also allows us to update that decision until a preset deadline. Roughly speaking, this lets us apply a Benjamini-Hochberg-type procedure over a moving window of hypotheses, where the threshold parameters for upcoming tests can be determined based on preliminary results.

In the first part, we study the problem in the central $\\epsilon$-DP model. We first provide a near-optimal result by developing a private and robust Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Then, we improve the result via a private and robust version of the Successive Elimination (SE) algorithm. Finally, we establish the lower bound to show that the instance-dependent regret of our improved algorithm is optimal. In the second part, we study the problem in the $\\epsilon$-LDP model. We propose an algorithm that can be seen as locally private and robust version of SE algorithm, which provably achieves (near) optimal rates for both instance-dependent and instance-independent regret. Our results reveal differences between the problem of private MAB with bounded/sub-Gaussian rewards and heavy-tailed rewards.

        "abstract": "We consider a graph-structured change point problem in which we observe a random vector with piece-wise constant but otherwise unknown mean and whose independent, sub-Gaussian coordinates correspond to the $n$ nodes of a fixed graph. We are interested in the localisation task of recovering the partition of the nodes associated to the constancy regions of the mean vector or, equivalently, of estimating the cut separating the sub-graphs over which the mean remains constant. Although graph-valued signals of this type have been previously studied in the literature for the different tasks of testing for the presence of an anomalous cluster and of estimating the mean vector, no localisation results are known outside the classical case of chain graphs. When the partition $\\mathcal{S}$ consists of only two elements, we characterise the difficulty of the localisation problem in terms of four key parameters: the maximal noise variance $\\sigma^2$, the size $\\Delta$ of the smaller element of the partition, the magnitude $\\kappa$ of the difference in the signal values across contiguous elements of the partition and the sum of the effective resistance edge weights $|\\partial_r(\\mathcal{S})|$ of the corresponding cut \u2013 a graph theoretic quantity quantifying the size of the partition boundary. In particular, we demonstrate an information theoretical lower bound implying that, in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime $\\kappa^2 \\Delta \\sigma^{-2} |\\partial_r(\\mathcal{S})|^{-1} \\lesssim 1$, no consistent estimator of the true partition exists. On the other hand, when $\\kappa^2 \\Delta \\sigma^{-2} |\\partial_r(\\mathcal{S})|^{-1} \\gtrsim \\zeta_n \\log\\{r(|E|)\\}$, with $r(|E|)$ being the sum of effective resistance weighted edges and $\\zeta_n$ being any diverging sequence in $n$, we show that a polynomial-time, approximate $\\ell_0$-penalised least squared estimator delivers a localisation error \u2013 measured by the symmetric difference between the true and estimated partition \u2013 of order $ \\kappa^{-2} \\sigma^2 |\\partial_r(\\mathcal{S})| \\log\\{r(|E|)\\}$.

Leveraging this, we conduct a thorough theoretical study of $\\mathsf{W}_p^\\varepsilon$, encompassing robustness guarantees, characterization of optimal perturbations, regularity, duality, and statistical estimation. In particular, by decoupling the optimization variables, we arrive at a simple dual form for $\\mathsf{W}_p^\\varepsilon$ that can be implemented via an elementary modification to standard, duality-based OT solvers.

This problem has been widely studied in machine learning and has widespread applications in recommendation systems, sports, social choice etc. Motivated by applications where there can be a substantial delay between requesting comparisons and receiving feedback, we consider an active/adaptive learning setting where the algorithm uses limited rounds of parallel interaction with the feedback generating oracle. We study this problem under the strong stochastic transitivity (SST) noise model which is a widely studied ranking model and captures many applications. A special case of this model is the noisy comparison model for which it was recently shown that $O(n \\log k)$ comparisons and $\\log^* n$ rounds of adaptivity are sufficient to find the set of top-$k$ items (Cohen-Addad et al., 2020; Braverman et al., 2019). Under the more general SST model, it is known that $O(n)$ comparisons and $O(n)$ rounds are sufficient to find a PAC top-1 item (Falahatgar et al., 2017a,b), however, not much seems to be known for general $k$, even given unbounded rounds of adaptivity. We first show that $\\Omega (nk)$ comparisons are necessary for PAC top-$k$ identification under SST even with unbounded adaptivity, establishing that this problem is strictly harder under SST than it is for the noisy comparison model. Our main contribution is to show that the 2-round query complexity for this problem is $\\widetilde{\\Theta} (n^{4/3} + nk)$, and to show that just 3 rounds are sufficient to obtain a nearly optimal query complexity of $\\widetilde{\\Theta}(nk)$.

For this purpose, some variant of Stochastic Mirror Descent is proposed for convex programming problems with Lipschitz-continuous functionals.

If trained with standard first-order methods most models forget previously learned tasks when trained on a new task, which is often referred to as catastrophic forgetting. A popular approach to overcome forgetting is to regularize the loss function by penalizing models that perform poorly on previous tasks. For example, elastic weight consolidation (EWC) regularizes with a quadratic form involving a diagonal matrix build based on past data. While EWC works very well for some setups, we show that, even under otherwise ideal conditions, it can provably suffer catastrophic forgetting if the diagonal matrix is a poor approximation of the Hessian matrix of previous tasks. We propose a simple approach to overcome this: Regularizing training of a new task with sketches of the Jacobian matrix of past data.

We propose to model these trajectories as collective realizations of a causal Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) flow of measures: The JKO scheme posits that the new configuration taken by a population at time t+1 is one that trades off an improvement, in the sense that it decreases an energy, while remaining close (in Wasserstein distance) to the previous configuration observed at t. In order to learn such an energy using only snapshots, we propose JKOnet, a neural architecture that computes (in end-to-end differentiable fashion) the JKO flow given a parametric energy and initial configuration of points.

FL raises many constraints which include privacy and data ownership, communication overhead, statistical heterogeneity, and partial client participation. In this paper, we address these problems in the framework of the Bayesian paradigm. To this end, we propose a novel federated Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, referred to as Quantised Langevin Stochastic Dynamics which may be seen as an extension to the FL setting of Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics, which handles the communication bottleneck using gradient compression.

To this end, we propose a novel federated Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, referred to as Quantised Langevin Stochastic Dynamics which may be seen as an extension to the FL setting of Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics, which handles the communication bottleneck using gradient compression.

        "abstract": "Machine learning classifiers rely on loss functions for performance evaluation, often on a private (hidden) dataset. In a recent line of research, label inference was introduced as the problem of reconstructing the ground truth labels of this private dataset from just the (possibly perturbed) cross-entropy loss function values evaluated at chosen prediction vectors (without any other access to the hidden dataset). In this paper, we formally study the necessary and sufficient conditions under which label inference is possible from any (noisy) loss function value. Using tools from analytical number theory, we show that a broad class of commonly used loss functions, including general Bregman divergence-based losses and multiclass cross-entropy with common activation functions like sigmoid and softmax, it is possible to design label inference attacks that succeed even for arbitrary noise levels and using only a single query from the adversary.

In a recent line of research, label inference was introduced as the problem of reconstructing the ground truth labels of this private dataset from just the (possibly perturbed) cross-entropy loss function values evaluated at chosen prediction vectors (without any other access to the hidden dataset). In this paper, we formally study the necessary and sufficient conditions under which label inference is possible from any (noisy) loss function value. Using tools from analytical number theory, we show that a broad class of commonly used loss functions, including general Bregman divergence-based losses and multiclass cross-entropy with common activation functions like sigmoid and softmax, it is possible to design label inference attacks that succeed even for arbitrary noise levels and using only a single query from the adversary. We formally study the computational complexity of label inference and show that while in general, designing adversarial prediction vectors for these attacks is co-NP-hard, once we have these vectors, the attacks can also be carried out through a lightweight augmentation to any neural network model, making them look benign and hard to detect.

Dealing with such a policy space is a hefty challenge, which often causes sample and computational inefficiencies. However, we argue that a limited number of policies are actually relevant when we also account for the structure of the environment and of the policy parameterization, as many of them would induce very similar interactions, i.e., state-action distributions. In this paper, we seek for a reward-free compression of the policy space into a finite set of representative policies, such that, given any policy $\\pi$, the minimum R\u00e9nyi divergence between the state-action distributions of the representative policies and the state-action distribution of $\\pi$ is bounded. We show that this compression of the policy space can be formulated as a set cover problem, and it is inherently NP-hard.

        "abstract": "Geometric median (GM) is a classical method in statistics for achieving robust estimation of the uncorrupted data; under gross corruption, it achieves the optimal breakdown point of 1/2. However, its computational complexity makes it infeasible for robustifying stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in high-dimensional optimization problems. In this paper, we show that by applying GM to only a judiciously chosen block of coordinates at a time and using a memory mechanism, one can retain the breakdown point of 1/2 for smooth non-convex problems, with non-asymptotic convergence rates comparable to the SGD with GM while resulting in significant speedup in training. We further validate the run-time and robustness of our approach empirically on several popular deep learning tasks. Code available at: https://github.com/anishacharya/BGMD",

When training a flexible discriminative model using a strictly proper loss, such noise will inevitably shift the solution towards the conditional distribution over noisy labels.

However, such observations concern robustness in accuracy, which is insufficient if reliable uncertainty quantification is critical. We demonstrate this by analysing the properties of the conditional distribution over noisy labels for an input-dependent noise model. In addition, we evaluate the set of robust loss functions characterised by noise-insensitive, asymptotic risk minimisers. We find that strictly proper and robust loss functions both offer asymptotic robustness in accuracy, but neither guarantee that the final model is calibrated. Moreover, even with robust loss functions, overfitting is an issue in practice. With these results, we aim to explain observed robustness of common training practices, such as early stopping, to label noise.

To solve the policy evaluation sub-problem in the presence of the deadly triad, we propose a generic algorithm framework of multi-step TD-learning with generalized importance sampling ratios, which includes two specific algorithms: the $\\lambda$-averaged $Q$-trace and the two-sided $Q$-trace. The generic algorithm is single time-scale, has provable finite-sample guarantees, and overcomes the high variance issue in off-policy learning.

Many existing approaches to bilevel optimization employ first-order sensitivity analysis, based on the implicit function theorem (IFT), for the lower problem to derive a gradient of the lower problem solution with respect to its parameters; this IFT gradient is then used in a first-order optimization method for the upper problem. This paper extends this sensitivity analysis to provide second-order derivative information of the lower problem (which we call the IFT Hessian), enabling the usage of faster-converging second-order optimization methods at the upper level. Our analysis shows that (i) much of the computation already used to produce the IFT gradient can be reused for the IFT Hessian, (ii) errors bounds derived for the IFT gradient readily apply to the IFT Hessian, (iii) computing IFT Hessians can significantly reduce overall computation by extracting more information from each lower level solve. We corroborate our findings and demonstrate the broad range of applications of our method by applying it to problem instances of least squares hyperparameter auto-tuning, multi-class SVM auto-tuning, and inverse optimal control.",

Many existing approaches to bilevel optimization employ first-order sensitivity analysis, based on the implicit function theorem (IFT), for the lower problem to derive a gradient of the lower problem solution with respect to its parameters; this IFT gradient is then used in a first-order optimization method for the upper problem. This paper extends this sensitivity analysis to provide second-order derivative information of the lower problem (which we call the IFT Hessian), enabling the usage of faster-converging second-order optimization methods at the upper level. Our analysis shows that (i) much of the computation already used to produce the IFT gradient can be reused for the IFT Hessian, (ii) errors bounds derived for the IFT gradient readily apply to the IFT Hessian, (iii) computing IFT Hessians can significantly reduce overall computation by extracting more information from each lower level solve. We corroborate our findings and demonstrate the broad range of applications of our method by applying it to problem instances of least squares hyperparameter auto-tuning, multi-class SVM auto-tuning, and inverse optimal control. }\n}",

        "abstract": "Attention based models such as Transformers involve pairwise interactions between data points, modeled with a learnable attention matrix. Importantly, this attention matrix is normalized with the SoftMax operator, which makes it row-wise stochastic. In this paper, we propose instead to use Sinkhorn\u2019s algorithm to make attention matrices doubly stochastic. We call the resulting model a Sinkformer. We show that the row-wise stochastic attention matrices in classical Transformers get close to doubly stochastic matrices as the number of epochs increases, justifying the use of Sinkhorn normalization as an informative prior. On the theoretical side, we show that, unlike the SoftMax operation, this normalization makes it possible to understand the iterations of self-attention modules as a discretized gradient-flow for the Wasserstein metric. We also show in the infinite number of samples limit that, when rescaling both attention matrices and depth, Sinkformers operate a heat diffusion. On the experimental side, we show that Sinkformers enhance model accuracy in vision and natural language processing tasks.

Importantly, this attention matrix is normalized with the SoftMax operator, which makes it row-wise stochastic. In this paper, we propose instead to use Sinkhorn\u2019s algorithm to make attention matrices doubly stochastic. We call the resulting model a Sinkformer. We show that the row-wise stochastic attention matrices in classical Transformers get close to doubly stochastic matrices as the number of epochs increases, justifying the use of Sinkhorn normalization as an informative prior. On the theoretical side, we show that, unlike the SoftMax operation, this normalization makes it possible to understand the iterations of self-attention modules as a discretized gradient-flow for the Wasserstein metric. We also show in the infinite number of samples limit that, when rescaling both attention matrices and depth, Sinkformers operate a heat diffusion. On the experimental side, we show that Sinkformers enhance model accuracy in vision and natural language processing tasks. In particular, on 3D shapes classification, Sinkformers lead to a significant improvement. }\n}",

However, in general, RNNs have a large number of parameters and involve enormous computational costs by repeating the recurrent structures in many time steps. As a method to overcome this difficulty, RNN pruning has attracted increasing attention in recent years, and it brings us benefits in terms of the reduction of computational cost as the time step progresses. However, most existing methods of RNN pruning are heuristic. The purpose of this paper is to study the theoretical scheme for RNN pruning method.

However, in general, RNNs have a large number of parameters and involve enormous computational costs by repeating the recurrent structures in many time steps. As a method to overcome this difficulty, RNN pruning has attracted increasing attention in recent years, and it brings us benefits in terms of the reduction of computational cost as the time step progresses. However, most existing methods of RNN pruning are heuristic. The purpose of this paper is to study the theoretical scheme for RNN pruning method.

We formalize the relevant causal structure of problems such as dynamic personalized pricing and other operations management problems in the presence of potentially high-dimensional user types. The key insight is that an individual-level response is often not causally affected by the state variable and can therefore easily be generalized across timesteps and states.

In this work, we present a federated learning approach to estimate the structure of Bayesian network from data that is horizontally partitioned across different parties.

        "abstract": "Bayesian optimization is a powerful paradigm to optimize black-box functions based on scarce and noisy data. Its data efficiency can be further improved by transfer learning from related tasks. While recent transfer models meta-learn a prior based on large amount of data, in the low-data regime methods that exploit the closed-form posterior of Gaussian processes (GPs) have an advantage. In this setting, several analytically tractable transfer-model posteriors have been proposed, but the relative advantages of these methods are not well understood. In this paper, we provide a unified view on hierarchical GP models for transfer learning, which allows us to analyze the relationship between methods. As part of the analysis, we develop a novel closed-form boosted GP transfer model that fits between existing approaches in terms of complexity.

Its data efficiency can be further improved by transfer learning from related tasks. While recent transfer models meta-learn a prior based on large amount of data, in the low-data regime methods that exploit the closed-form posterior of Gaussian processes (GPs) have an advantage. In this setting, several analytically tractable transfer-model posteriors have been proposed, but the relative advantages of these methods are not well understood. In this paper, we provide a unified view on hierarchical GP models for transfer learning, which allows us to analyze the relationship between methods. As part of the analysis, we develop a novel closed-form boosted GP transfer model that fits between existing approaches in terms of complexity. We evaluate the performance of the different approaches in large-scale experiments and highlight strengths and weaknesses of the different transfer-learning methods. }\n}",

        "abstract": "Bayesian optimization is a class of global optimization techniques. In Bayesian optimization, the underlying objective function is modeled as a realization of a Gaussian process. Although the Gaussian process assumption implies a random distribution of the Bayesian optimization outputs, quantification of this uncertainty is rarely studied in the literature. In this work, we propose a novel approach to assess the output uncertainty of Bayesian optimization algorithms, which proceeds by constructing confidence regions of the maximum point (or value) of the objective function.

In Bayesian optimization, the underlying objective function is modeled as a realization of a Gaussian process. Although the Gaussian process assumption implies a random distribution of the Bayesian optimization outputs, quantification of this uncertainty is rarely studied in the literature. In this work, we propose a novel approach to assess the output uncertainty of Bayesian optimization algorithms, which proceeds by constructing confidence regions of the maximum point (or value) of the objective function.

Therefore, we face the challenging new problem of foresight dynamic selection (FDS): finding a dynamic and light-weight policy to decide which features to observe next, before actually observing them, for overall performance-cost trade-offs. To tackle FDS, this paper proposes a Bayesian learning framework of Variational Foresight Dynamic Selection (VFDS). VFDS learns a policy that selects the next feature subset to observe, by optimizing a variational Bayesian objective that characterizes the trade-off between model performance and feature cost. At its core is an implicit variational distribution on binary gates that are dependent on previous observations, which will select the next subset of features to observe. We apply VFDS on the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) task where the performance-cost trade-off is critical in its practice.

Yet, the loss landscape of such networks and its interaction with state-of-the-art optimizers is not fully understood. One of the most crucial aspects is the landscape at random initialization, which often influences convergence speed dramatically. In their seminal works, Xavier & Bengio, 2010 and He et al., 2015 propose an initialization strategy that is supposed to prevent gradients from vanishing. Yet, we identify some shortcomings of their expectation analysis as network depth increases, and show that the proposed initialization can actually fail to deliver stable gradient norms. More precisely, by leveraging an in-depth analysis of the median of the forward pass, we first show that, with high probability, vanishing gradients cannot be circumvented when the network width scales with less than O(depth). Second, we extend this analysis to second-order derivatives and show that random i.i.d. initialization also gives rise to Hessian matrices with eigenspectra that vanish as networks grow in depth. Whenever this happens, optimizers are initialized in a very flat, saddle point-like plateau, which is particularly hard to escape with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as its escaping time is inversely related to curvature magnitudes. We believe that this observation is crucial for fully understanding (a) the historical difficulties of training deep nets with vanilla SGD and (b) the success of adaptive gradient methods, which naturally adapt to curvature and thus quickly escape flat plateaus.",

Yet, we identify some shortcomings of their expectation analysis as network depth increases, and show that the proposed initialization can actually fail to deliver stable gradient norms. More precisely, by leveraging an in-depth analysis of the median of the forward pass, we first show that, with high probability, vanishing gradients cannot be circumvented when the network width scales with less than O(depth). Second, we extend this analysis to second-order derivatives and show that random i.i.d. initialization also gives rise to Hessian matrices with eigenspectra that vanish as networks grow in depth. Whenever this happens, optimizers are initialized in a very flat, saddle point-like plateau, which is particularly hard to escape with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as its escaping time is inversely related to curvature magnitudes. We believe that this observation is crucial for fully understanding (a) the historical difficulties of training deep nets with vanilla SGD and (b) the success of adaptive gradient methods, which naturally adapt to curvature and thus quickly escape flat plateaus. }\n}",

Unfortunately, standard estimators of mixture parameters, like the MLE, are known to exhibit pathological behavior. We study this behavior in a simple but fundamental example, a two-component Gaussian mixture model in which only the component means and variances are unknown, and focus on the setting in which the components are weakly separated. In this case, we show that the asymptotic convergence rate of the MLE is quite poor, such as $O(n^{-1/6})$ or even $O(n^{-1/8})$. We then demonstrate via both theoretical arguments and extensive simulations that the MLE behaves like a threshold estimator in finite samples, in the sense that the MLE can give strong evidence that the means are equal when the truth is otherwise. We also explore the behavior of the MLE when the MLE is non-zero, showing that it is difficult to estimate both the sign and magnitude of the means in this case. We provide diagnostics for all of these pathologies and apply these ideas to re-analyzing two randomized evaluations of job training programs, JOBS II and Job Corps. Our results suggest that the corresponding maximum likelihood estimates should be interpreted with caution in these cases.",

To capture external changes, the black-box function is allowed to be time-varying within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). To this end, we develop WGP-UCB, a novel UCB-type algorithm based on weighted Gaussian process regression. A key challenge is how to cope with infinite-dimensional feature maps.

Further, a novel concentration inequality is achieved for weighted Gaussian process regression with general weights. We also provide universal upper bounds and weight-dependent upper bounds for weighted maximum information gains.

        "abstract": "We study the $p$-generalized probit regression model, which is a generalized linear model for binary responses. It extends the standard probit model by replacing its link function, the standard normal cdf, by a $p$-generalized normal distribution for $p\\in[1, \\infty)$. The $p$-generalized normal distributions (Subbotin, 1923) are of special interest in statistical modeling because they fit much more flexibly to data. Their tail behavior can be controlled by choice of the parameter $p$, which influences the model\u2019s sensitivity to outliers. Special cases include the Laplace, the Gaussian, and the uniform distributions. We further show how the maximum likelihood estimator for $p$-generalized probit regression can be approximated efficiently up to a factor of $(1+\\varepsilon)$ on large data by combining sketching techniques with importance subsampling to obtain a small data summary called coreset.",
