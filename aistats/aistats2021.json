In this paper, we rely on a recent Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) view on the CMS to develop a novel learning-augmented CMS under power-law data streams. We assume that tokens in the stream are drawn from an unknown discrete distribution, which is endowed with a normalized inverse Gaussian process (NIGP) prior. Then, using distributional properties of the NIGP, we compute the posterior distribution of a token\u2019s frequency in the stream, given the hashed data, and in turn corresponding BNP estimates. Applications to synthetic and real data show that our approach achieves a remarkable performance in the estimation of low-frequency tokens. This is known to be a desirable feature in the context of natural language processing, where it is indeed common in the context of the power-law behaviour of the data.",

While many works have been focusing on understanding the loss dynamics by training neural networks with the gradient descent (GD), in this work, we consider a broad class of optimization algorithms that are commonly used in practice. For example, we show from a dynamical system perspective that the Heavy Ball (HB) method can converge to global minimum on mean squared error (MSE) at a linear rate (similar to GD); however, the Nesterov accelerated gradient descent (NAG) may only converge to global minimum sublinearly. Our results rely on the connection between neural tangent kernel (NTK) and finitely-wide over-parameterized neural networks with ReLU activation, which leads to analyzing the limiting ordinary differential equations (ODE) for optimization algorithms. We show that, optimizing the non-convex loss over the weights corresponds to optimizing some strongly convex loss over the prediction error.

These metrics are used to tune the hyperparameters of FOA. We introduce a class of perturbations quantified via a new norm, called *-norm. We show that adding a small perturbation to the objective function has an equivalently small impact on the behavior of any FOA, which suggests that it should have a minor impact on the tuning of the algorithm. However, we show that smoothness and strong convexity can be heavily impacted by arbitrarily small perturbations, leading to excessively conservative tunings and convergence issues. In view of these observations, we propose a notion of continuity of the metrics, which is essential for a robust tuning strategy. Since smoothness and strong convexity are not continuous, we propose a comprehensive study of existing alternative metrics which we prove to be continuous.

Due to non-uniformity and technical limitations in omics platforms, such integrative analyses on multiple omics, which we refer to as views, involve learning from incomplete observations with various view-missing patterns. This is challenging because i) complex interactions within and across observed views need to be properly addressed for optimal predictive power and ii) observations with various view-missing patterns need to be flexibly integrated. To address such challenges, we propose a deep variational information bottleneck (IB) approach for incomplete multi-view observations. Our method applies the IB framework on marginal and joint representations of the observed views to focus on intra-view and inter-view interactions that are relevant for the target. Most importantly, by modeling the joint representations as a product of marginal representations, we can efficiently learn from observed views with various view-missing patterns.

In our framework, the user specifies subgoal regions which are subsets of states; then, we (i) learn options that serve as transitions between these subgoal regions, and (ii) construct a high-level plan in the resulting abstract decision process (ADP). A key challenge is that the ADP may not be Markov; we propose two algorithms for planning in the ADP that address this issue. Our first algorithm is conservative, allowing us to prove theoretical guarantees on its performance, which help inform the design of subgoal regions.

These optimization problems often involve complex side constraints, imposed by the underlying application. In this paper, we develop an algorithm with poly-logarithmic adaptivity for non-monotone submodular maximization under general side constraints. The adaptive complexity of a problem is the minimal number of sequential rounds required to achieve the objective. Our algorithm is suitable to maximize a non-monotone submodular function under a p-system side constraint, and it achieves a (p + O(sqrt(p)))-approximation for this problem, after only poly-logarithmic adaptive rounds and polynomial queries to the valuation oracle function. Furthermore, our algorithm achieves a (p + O(1))-approximation when the given side constraint is a p-extendable system. This algorithm yields an exponential speed-up, with respect to the adaptivity, over any other known constant-factor approximation algorithm for this problem. It also competes with previous known results in terms of the query complexity. We perform various experiments on various real-world applications. We find that, in comparison with commonly used heuristics, our algorithm performs better on these instances.",

        "author": "Chaoqi Wang; Shengyang Sun; Roger Grosse",
        "abstract": "While uncertainty estimation is a well-studied topic in deep learning, most such work focuses on marginal uncertainty estimates, i.e. the predictive mean and variance at individual input locations. But it is often more useful to estimate predictive correlations between the function values at different input locations. In this paper, we consider the problem of benchmarking how accurately Bayesian models can estimate predictive correlations. We first consider a downstream task which depends on posterior predictive correlations: transductive active learning (TAL).

For example, digital platforms like Yelp use ML to predict user preference and make recommendations. A service that is more often queried by users, perhaps because it more accurately anticipates user preferences, is also more likely to obtain additional user data (e.g. in the form of a Yelp review). Thus, competing predictors cause feedback loops whereby a predictor\u2019s performance impacts what training data it receives and biases its predictions over time. We introduce a flexible model of competing ML predictors that enables both rapid experimentation and theoretical tractability. We show with empirical and mathematical analysis that competition causes predictors to specialize for specific sub-populations at the cost of worse performance over the general population. We further analyze the impact of predictor specialization on the overall prediction quality experienced by users. We show that having too few or too many competing predictors in a market can hurt the overall prediction quality. Our theory is complemented by experiments on several real datasets using popular learning algorithms, such as neural networks and nearest neighbor methods.",

Recently, Heng & Jacob (2019) studied Metropolis HMC with couplings for unbiased Monte Carlo estimation, establishing a generic parallelizable scheme for HMC. However, in practice a different HMC method, multinomial HMC, is considered as the go-to method, e.g. as part of the no-U-turn sampler. In multinomial HMC, proposed states are not limited to end-points as in Metropolis HMC; instead points along the entire trajectory can be proposed. In this paper, we establish couplings for multinomial HMC, based on optimal transport for multinomial sampling in its transition. We prove an upper bound for the meeting time \u2013 the time it takes for the coupled chains to meet \u2013 based on the notion of local contractivity. We evaluate our methods using three targets: 1,000 dimensional Gaussians, logistic regression and log-Gaussian Cox point processes. Compared to Heng & Jacob (2019), coupled multinomial HMC generally attains a smaller meeting time, and is more robust to choices of step sizes and trajectory lengths, which allows re-use of existing adaptation methods for HMC.

In this paper, we incorporate over-parameterized neural networks into semi-parametric models to bridge the gap between inference and prediction, especially in the high dimensional linear problem. By doing so, we can exploit a wide class of networks to approximate the nuisance functions and to estimate the parameters of interest consistently. Therefore, we may offer the best of two worlds: the universal approximation ability from neural networks and the interpretability from classic ordinary linear model, leading to valid inference and accurate prediction. We show the theoretical foundations that make this possible and demonstrate with numerical experiments. Furthermore, we propose a framework, DebiNet, in which we plug-in arbitrary feature selection methods to our semi-parametric neural network and illustrate that our framework debiases the regularized estimators and performs well, in terms of the post-selection inference and the generalization error.",

For example, in the email marketing campaign application, the layers correspond to Open, Click and Purchase events. Conversions from Click to Purchase happen very infrequently because a purchase cannot be made unless the link in an email is clicked on. We formulate this challenging decision making problem as a contextual bandit with funnel structure and develop a multi-task learning algorithm that mitigates the lack of sufficient observations from deeper layers.

        "abstract": "The paper provides a thorough investigation of Direct Loss Minimization (DLM), which optimizes the posterior to minimize predictive loss, in sparse Gaussian processes. For the conjugate case, we consider DLM for log-loss and DLM for square loss showing a significant performance improvement in both cases. The application of DLM in non-conjugate cases is more complex because the logarithm of expectation in the log-loss DLM objective is often intractable and simple sampling leads to biased estimates of gradients. The paper makes two technical contributions to address this. First, a new method using product sampling is proposed, which gives unbiased estimates of gradients (uPS) for the objective function.

For the conjugate case, we consider DLM for log-loss and DLM for square loss showing a significant performance improvement in both cases. The application of DLM in non-conjugate cases is more complex because the logarithm of expectation in the log-loss DLM objective is often intractable and simple sampling leads to biased estimates of gradients. The paper makes two technical contributions to address this. First, a new method using product sampling is proposed, which gives unbiased estimates of gradients (uPS) for the objective function. Second, a theoretical analysis of biased Monte Carlo estimates (bMC) shows that stochastic gradient descent converges despite the biased gradients. Experiments demonstrate empirical success of DLM. A comparison of the sampling methods shows that, while uPS is potentially more sample-efficient, bMC provides a better tradeoff in terms of convergence time and computational efficiency. }\n}",

Dual Principal Component Pursuit (DPCP) is a non-convex method that is specifically designed for learning high-dimensional subspaces, such as hyperplanes.

Moreover, the provable algorithm based on recursive linear programming is not efficient. In this paper, we introduce a new notion of geometric dominance, which explicitly captures the distribution of the data, and derive both geometric and probabilistic conditions under which a global solution to DPCP is a normal vector to a geometrically dominant hyperplane. We then prove that the DPCP problem for a union of hyperplanes satisfies a Riemannian regularity condition, and use this result to show that a scalable Riemannian subgradient method exhibits (local) linear convergence to the normal vector of the geometrically dominant hyperplane.

        "author": "Adarsh Subbaswamy; Roy Adams; Suchi Saria",
        "abstract": "As the use of machine learning in high impact domains becomes widespread, the importance of evaluating safety has increased. An important aspect of this is evaluating how robust a model is to changes in setting or population, which typically requires applying the model to multiple, independent datasets. Since the cost of collecting such datasets is often prohibitive, in this paper, we propose a framework for evaluating this type of stability using the available data. We use the original evaluation data to determine distributions under which the algorithm performs poorly, and estimate the algorithm\u2019s performance on the \"worst-case\" distribution. We consider shifts in user defined conditional distributions, allowing some distributions to shift while keeping other portions of the data distribution fixed. For example, in a healthcare context, this allows us to consider shifts in clinical practice while keeping the patient population fixed.

An important aspect of this is evaluating how robust a model is to changes in setting or population, which typically requires applying the model to multiple, independent datasets. Since the cost of collecting such datasets is often prohibitive, in this paper, we propose a framework for evaluating this type of stability using the available data. We use the original evaluation data to determine distributions under which the algorithm performs poorly, and estimate the algorithm\u2019s performance on the \"worst-case\" distribution. We consider shifts in user defined conditional distributions, allowing some distributions to shift while keeping other portions of the data distribution fixed. For example, in a healthcare context, this allows us to consider shifts in clinical practice while keeping the patient population fixed.

        "author": "Setareh Ariafar; Zelda Mariet; Dana Brooks; Jennifer Dy; Jasper Snoek",
        "abstract": "Many contemporary machine learning models require extensive tuning of hyperparameters to perform well. A variety of methods, such as Bayesian optimization, have been developed to automate and expedite this process. However, tuning remains extremely costly as it typically requires repeatedly fully training models. To address this issue, Bayesian optimization methods have been extended to use cheap, partially trained models to extrapolate to expensive complete models. While this approach enlarges the set of explored hyperparameters, including many low-fidelity observations adds to the intrinsic randomness of the procedure and makes extrapolation challenging. We propose to accelerate hyperparameter tuning for neural networks in a robust way by taking into account the relative amount of information contributed by each training example. To do so, we integrate importance sampling with Bayesian optimization, which significantly increases the quality of the black-box function evaluations and their runtime.

A variety of methods, such as Bayesian optimization, have been developed to automate and expedite this process. However, tuning remains extremely costly as it typically requires repeatedly fully training models. To address this issue, Bayesian optimization methods have been extended to use cheap, partially trained models to extrapolate to expensive complete models. While this approach enlarges the set of explored hyperparameters, including many low-fidelity observations adds to the intrinsic randomness of the procedure and makes extrapolation challenging. We propose to accelerate hyperparameter tuning for neural networks in a robust way by taking into account the relative amount of information contributed by each training example. To do so, we integrate importance sampling with Bayesian optimization, which significantly increases the quality of the black-box function evaluations and their runtime. To overcome the additional overhead cost of using importance sampling, we cast hyperparameter search as a multi-task Bayesian optimization problem over both hyperparameters and importance sampling design, which achieves the best of both worlds.

For example, events such as species co-occurrence in ecology and wars in political science are often much rarer than non-events. Logistic regression has been widely used for CPE, while it tends to underestimate the probability of rare events. Its main drawback is symmetry of the logit link\u2014symmetric links can be misled by small and imbalanced samples because it is more incentivized to overestimate the majority class with finite samples. Parametric skewed links have been proposed to overcome this limitation, but their estimation usually results in nonconvex optimization unlike the logit link. Such nonconvexity is knotty not only from the computational viewpoint but also in terms of the parameter identifiability.

For example, events such as species co-occurrence in ecology and wars in political science are often much rarer than non-events. Logistic regression has been widely used for CPE, while it tends to underestimate the probability of rare events. Its main drawback is symmetry of the logit link\u2014symmetric links can be misled by small and imbalanced samples because it is more incentivized to overestimate the majority class with finite samples. Parametric skewed links have been proposed to overcome this limitation, but their estimation usually results in nonconvex optimization unlike the logit link. Such nonconvexity is knotty not only from the computational viewpoint but also in terms of the parameter identifiability.

This work proposes an algorithm for finding the FNEs of a two-player zero-sum game, in which the local cost functions can be non-convex, and the players only have access to local stochastic gradients. The proposed approach is based on reformulating the problem of interest as minimizing the Regularized Nikaido-Isoda (RNI) function.

The key in the analysis is to properly control the bias between the local stochastic gradient and the true one.

        "abstract": "Cycle-consistent training is widely used for jointly learning a forward and inverse mapping between two domains of interest without the cumbersome requirement of collecting matched pairs within each domain. In this regard, the implicit assumption is that there exists (at least approximately) a ground-truth bijection such that a given input from either domain can be accurately reconstructed from successive application of the respective mappings. But in many applications no such bijection can be expected to exist and large reconstruction errors can compromise the success of cycle-consistent training. As one important instance of this limitation, we consider practically-relevant situations where there exists a many-to-one or surjective mapping between domains. To address this regime, we develop a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) approach that can be viewed as converting surjective mappings to implicit bijections whereby reconstruction errors in both directions can be minimized, and as a natural byproduct, realistic output diversity can be obtained in the one-to-many direction. As theoretical motivation, we analyze a simplified scenario whereby minima of the proposed CVAE-based energy function align with the recovery of ground-truth surjective mappings. On the empirical side, we consider a synthetic image dataset with known ground-truth, as well as a real-world application involving natural language generation from knowledge graphs and vice versa, a prototypical surjective case. For the latter, our CVAE pipeline can capture such many-to-one mappings during cycle training while promoting textural diversity for graph-to-text tasks.",

        "abstract": "A traditional approach to initialization in deep neural networks (DNNs) is to sample the network weights randomly for preserving the variance of pre-activations. On the other hand, several studies show that during the training process, the distribution of stochastic gradients can be heavy-tailed especially for small batch sizes. In this case, weights and therefore pre-activations can be modeled with a heavy-tailed distribution that has an in\ufb01nite variance but has a \ufb01nite (non-integer) fractional moment of order $s$ with $s < 2$. Motivated by this fact, we develop initialization schemes for fully connected feed-forward networks that can provably preserve any given moment of order $s\\in (0,2]$ over the layers for a class of activations including ReLU, Leaky ReLU, Randomized Leaky ReLU, and linear activations. These generalized schemes recover traditional initialization schemes in the limit $s \\to 2$ and serve as part of a principled theory for initialization. For all these schemes, we show that the network output admits a \ufb01nite almost sure limit as the number of layers grows, and the limit is heavy-tailed in some settings. This sheds further light into the origins of heavy tail during signal propagation in DNNs. We also prove that the logarithm of the norm of the network outputs, if properly scaled, will converge to a Gaussian distribution with an explicit mean and variance we can compute depending on the activation used, the value of $s$ chosen and the network width, where log-normality serves as a further justi\ufb01cation of why the norm of the network output can be heavy-tailed in DNNs. We also prove that our initialization scheme avoids small network output values more frequently compared to traditional approaches. Our results extend if dropout is used and the proposed initialization strategy does not have an extra cost during the training procedure. We show through numerical experiments that our initialization can improve the training and test performance.",

GANs have been widely used in sample synthesis, de-noising, domain transfer, etc. GANs, however, are designed in a model-free fashion where no additional information about the underlying distribution is available. In many applications, however, practitioners have access to the underlying independence graph of the variables, either as a Bayesian network or a Markov Random Field (MRF). We ask: how can one use this additional information in designing model-based GANs? In this paper, we provide theoretical foundations to answer this question by studying subadditivity properties of probability divergences, which establish upper bounds on the distance between two high-dimensional distributions by the sum of distances between their marginals over (local) neighborhoods of the graphical structure of the Bayes-net or the MRF. We prove that several popular probability divergences satisfy some notion of subadditivity under mild conditions.

We introduce a simple and fast method for generating interpretable CEs in a white-box setting without an auxiliary model, by using the predictive uncertainty of the classifier. Our experiments show that our proposed algorithm generates more interpretable CEs, according to IM1 scores (Van Looveren et al., 2019), than existing methods.

We show experimental results for plain convex and non-convex problems for biased (i.e., heterogeneous) and unbiased local data sets. }\n}",

        "abstract": "We propose kernel distributionally robust optimization (Kernel DRO) using insights from the robust optimization theory and functional analysis. Our method uses reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) to construct a wide range of convex ambiguity sets, which can be generalized to sets based on integral probability metrics and finite-order moment bounds.

Specifically, Daskalakis et al 2018, Liang-Stokes 2019, show last iterate convergence of the so called \u201cOptimistic Gradient Descent/Ascent\" for the case of \\textit{unconstrained} min-max optimization. Moreover, in Mertikopoulos et al 2019 the authors show that Mirror Descent with an extra gradient step displays last iterate convergence for convex-concave problems (both constrained and unconstrained), though their algorithm uses \\textit{vanishing stepsizes}.

        "abstract": "Organ transplantation can improve life expectancy for recipients, but the probability of a successful transplant depends on the compatibility between donor and recipient features. Current medical practice relies on coarse rules for donor-recipient matching, but is short of domain knowledge regarding the complex factors underlying organ compatibility. In this paper, we formulate the problem of learning data-driven rules for donor-recipient matching using observational data for organ allocations and transplant outcomes.

This problem has been studied extensively when users\u2019 preferences do not change over time (static case); an assumption that is often violated in practical settings. In this paper, we introduce a novel model for online non-stationary recommendation systems which allows for temporal uncertainties in the users\u2019 preferences. For this model, we propose a user-based CF algorithm, and provide a theoretical analysis of its achievable reward. Compared to related non-stationary multi-armed bandit literature, the main fundamental difficulty in our model lies in the fact that variations in the preferences of a certain user may affect the recommendations for other users severely. We also test our algorithm over real-world datasets, showing its effectiveness in real-world applications. One of the main surprising observations in our experiments is the fact our algorithm outperforms other static algorithms even when preferences do not change over time.

This problem has been studied extensively when users\u2019 preferences do not change over time (static case); an assumption that is often violated in practical settings. In this paper, we introduce a novel model for online non-stationary recommendation systems which allows for temporal uncertainties in the users\u2019 preferences. For this model, we propose a user-based CF algorithm, and provide a theoretical analysis of its achievable reward. Compared to related non-stationary multi-armed bandit literature, the main fundamental difficulty in our model lies in the fact that variations in the preferences of a certain user may affect the recommendations for other users severely. We also test our algorithm over real-world datasets, showing its effectiveness in real-world applications. One of the main surprising observations in our experiments is the fact our algorithm outperforms other static algorithms even when preferences do not change over time. This hints toward the general conclusion that in practice, dynamic algorithms, such as the one we propose, might be beneficial even in stationary environments. }\n}",

The Plackett-Luce (PL) model has been widely used in listwise LTR methods. However, given $N$ items with $M$ partitions, calculating the likelihood of data with partitioned preference under the PL model has a time complexity of $O(N+S!)$, where $S$ is the maximum size of the top $M-1$ partitions. This computational challenge restrains existing PL-based listwise LTR methods to only a special case of partitioned preference, \\textit{top-$K$ ranking}, where the exact order of the top $K$ items is known. In this paper, we exploit a random utility model formulation of the PL model and propose an efficient approach through numerical integration for calculating the likelihood. This numerical approach reduces the aforementioned time complexity to $O(N+MS)$, which allows training deep-neural-network-based ranking models with a large output space. We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms well-known LTR baselines and remains scalable through both simulation experiments and applications to real-world eXtreme Multi-Label (XML) classification tasks.

This numerical approach reduces the aforementioned time complexity to $O(N+MS)$, which allows training deep-neural-network-based ranking models with a large output space. We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms well-known LTR baselines and remains scalable through both simulation experiments and applications to real-world eXtreme Multi-Label (XML) classification tasks. The proposed method also achieves state-of-the-art performance on XML datasets with relatively large numbers of labels per sample. }\n}",

        "abstract": "There is an increasing use of algorithms to inform decisions in many settings, from student evaluations, college admissions, to credit scoring. These decisions are made by applying a decision rule to individual\u2019s observed features. Given the impacts of these decisions on individuals, decision makers are increasingly required to be transparent on their decision making to offer the \u201cright to explanation.\u201d Meanwhile, being transparent also invites potential manipulations, also known as gaming, that the individuals can utilize the knowledge to strategically alter their features in order to receive a more beneficial decision. In this work, we study the problem of \\emph{robust} decision-making under strategic behavior. Prior works often assume that the decision maker has full knowledge of individuals\u2019 cost structure for manipulations. We study the robust variant that relaxes this assumption: The decision maker does not have full knowledge but knows only a subset of the individuals\u2019 available actions and associated costs. To approach this non-quantifiable uncertainty, we define robustness based on the worst-case guarantee of a decision, over all possible actions (including actions unknown to the decision maker) individuals might take. A decision rule is called \\emph{robust optimal} if its worst case performance is (weakly) better than that of all other decision rules. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, we provide a crisp characterization of the above robust optimality: For any decision rules under mild conditions that are robust optimal, there exists a linear decision rule that is equally robust optimal. Second, we explore the computational problem of searching for the robust optimal decision rule and interestingly, we demonstrate the problem is closely related to distributionally robust optimization. We believe our results promotes the use of simple linear decisions with uncertain individual manipulations.",

Our framework covers both the identical and heterogeneous data settings, supports both random and deterministic number of local steps, and can work with a wide array of local stochastic gradient estimators, including shifted estimators which are able to adjust the fixed points of local iterations for faster convergence. As an application of our framework, we develop multiple novel FL optimizers which are superior to existing methods.

We propose an algorithm based on a novel combination of online-to-confidence-set conversion\u00a0\\citep{abbasi2012online} and the exponentially weighted average forecaster constructed by a covering of low-rank matrices. In $T$ rounds, our algorithm achieves $\\widetilde{O}((d_1+d_2)^{3/2}\\sqrt{rT})$ regret that improves upon the standard linear bandit regret bound of $\\widetilde{O}(d_1d_2\\sqrt{T})$ when the rank of $\\Theta^*$: $r \\ll \\min\\{d_1,d_2\\}$.

The KLD is a strong mode of convergence, requiring absolute continuity of measures and placing restrictions on which transport maps can be permitted.

Our experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet classification datasets with VGG-16, ResNet-18, and MobileNetV2 architectures show that our MD variants yield state-of-the-art performance.",

Lastly, we perform extensive numerical simulations to understand the behavior of a suite of algorithms for various instances and recommend a practical guide to employ different algorithms. }\n}",

In particular, high-fidelity solutions are much more expensive than low-fidelity ones. To reduce the cost, we consider novel Gaussian process (GP) models that leverage simulation examples of different fidelities to predict high-dimensional PDE solution outputs. Existing GP methods are either not scalable to high-dimensional outputs or lack effective strategies to integrate multi-fidelity examples. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Fidelity High-Order Gaussian Process (MFHoGP) that can capture complex correlations both between the outputs and between the fidelities to enhance solution estimation, and scale to large numbers of outputs. Based on a novel nonlinear coregionalization model, MFHoGP propagates bases throughout fidelities to fuse information, and places a deep matrix GP prior over the basis weights to capture the (nonlinear) relationships across the fidelities. To improve inference efficiency and quality, we use bases decomposition to largely reduce the model parameters, and layer-wise matrix Gaussian posteriors to capture the posterior dependency and to simplify the computation. Our stochastic variational learning algorithm successfully handles millions of outputs without extra sparse approximations. We show the advantages of our method in several typical applications.",

We investigate how the empirical Bayesian can make use of neural density estimators first to use all noise-corrupted observations to estimate a prior or source distribution over uncorrupted samples, and then to perform single-observation posterior inference using the fitted source distribution. We propose an approach based on the direct maximization of the log-marginal likelihood of the observations, examining both biased and de-biased estimators, and comparing to variational approaches. We find that, up to symmetries, a neural empirical Bayes approach recovers ground truth source distributions.

We propose an approach based on the direct maximization of the log-marginal likelihood of the observations, examining both biased and de-biased estimators, and comparing to variational approaches.

        "abstract": "The need to evaluate treatment effectiveness is ubiquitous in most of empirical science, and interest in flexibly investigating effect heterogeneity is growing rapidly. To do so, a multitude of model-agnostic, nonparametric meta-learners have been proposed in recent years. Such learners decompose the treatment effect estimation problem into separate sub-problems, each solvable using standard supervised learning methods. Choosing between different meta-learners in a data-driven manner is difficult, as it requires access to counterfactual information. Therefore, with the ultimate goal of building better understanding of the conditions under which some learners can be expected to perform better than others a priori, we theoretically analyze four broad meta-learning strategies which rely on plug-in estimation and pseudo-outcome regression.

To do so, a multitude of model-agnostic, nonparametric meta-learners have been proposed in recent years. Such learners decompose the treatment effect estimation problem into separate sub-problems, each solvable using standard supervised learning methods. Choosing between different meta-learners in a data-driven manner is difficult, as it requires access to counterfactual information. Therefore, with the ultimate goal of building better understanding of the conditions under which some learners can be expected to perform better than others a priori, we theoretically analyze four broad meta-learning strategies which rely on plug-in estimation and pseudo-outcome regression. We highlight how this theoretical reasoning can be used to guide principled algorithm design and translate our analyses into practice by considering a variety of neural network architectures as base-learners for the discussed meta-learning strategies. In a simulation study, we showcase the relative strengths of the learners under different data-generating processes. }\n}",

This lack becomes particularly prominent when considering permutation-invariant networks, due to the symmetrical redundancy among the linear regions. To tackle this, we propose a refined definition of piecewise linear function complexity: instead of counting the number of linear regions directly, we first introduce an equivalence relation among the linear functions composing a piecewise linear function and then count those linear functions relative to that equivalence relation. Our new complexity measure can clearly distinguish between the two aforementioned models, is consistent with the classical measure, and increases exponentially with depth.",

We consider sequential algorithms that greedily minimise MMD over a discrete candidate set. We propose a novel non-myopic algorithm and, in order to both improve statistical efficiency and reduce computational cost, we investigate a variant that applies this technique to a mini-batch of the candidate set at each iteration.

        "abstract": "Using only samples from a probabilistic model, we predict properties of the model and of future observations. The prediction game continues in an online fashion as the sample size grows with new observations. After each prediction, the predictor incurs a binary (0-1) loss. The probability model underlying a sample is otherwise unknown except that it belongs to a known class of models. The goal is to make finitely many errors (i.e. loss of 1) with probability 1 under the generating model, no matter what it may be in the known model class. Model classes admitting predictors that make only finitely many errors are eventually almost surely (eas) predictable. When the losses incurred are observable (the supervised case), we completely characterize eas predictable classes. We provide analogous results in the unsupervised case. Our results have a natural interpretation in terms of regularization. In eas-predictable classes, we study if it is possible to have a universal stopping rule that identifies (to any given confidence) when no more errors will be made.

The prediction game continues in an online fashion as the sample size grows with new observations. After each prediction, the predictor incurs a binary (0-1) loss. The probability model underlying a sample is otherwise unknown except that it belongs to a known class of models. The goal is to make finitely many errors (i.e. loss of 1) with probability 1 under the generating model, no matter what it may be in the known model class. Model classes admitting predictors that make only finitely many errors are eventually almost surely (eas) predictable. When the losses incurred are observable (the supervised case), we completely characterize eas predictable classes. We provide analogous results in the unsupervised case. Our results have a natural interpretation in terms of regularization. In eas-predictable classes, we study if it is possible to have a universal stopping rule that identifies (to any given confidence) when no more errors will be made. Classes admitting such a stopping rule are eas learnable. When samples are generated iid, we provide a complete characterization of eas learnability.

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of model selection for two popular stochastic linear bandit settings, and propose algorithms that adapts to the unknown problem complexity. In the first setting, we consider the $K$ armed mixture bandits, where the mean reward of arm $i \\in [K]$ is $\\mu_i+ \u27e8\\alpha_{i,t},\\theta^* \u27e9$, with $\\alpha_{i,t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ being the known context vector and $\\mu_i \\in [-1,1]$ and $\\theta^*$ are unknown parameters. We define $\\|\\theta^*\\|$ as the problem complexity and consider a sequence of nested hypothesis classes, each positing a different upper bound on $\\|\\theta^*\\|$. Exploiting this, we propose Adaptive Linear Bandit (ALB), a novel phase based algorithm that adapts to the true problem complexity, $\\|\\theta^*\\|$. We show that ALB achieves regret scaling of $\\widetilde{O}(\\|\\theta^*\\|\\sqrt{T})$, where $\\|\\theta^*\\|$ is apriori unknown. As a corollary, when $\\theta^*=0$, ALB recovers the minimax regret for the simple bandit algorithm without such knowledge of $\\theta^*$. ALB is the first algorithm that uses parameter norm as model section criteria for linear bandits. Prior state of art algorithms achieve a regret of $\\widetilde{O}(L\\sqrt{T})$, where $L$ is the upper bound on $\\|\\theta^*\\|$, fed as an input to the problem. In the second setting, we consider the standard linear bandit problem (with possibly an infinite number of arms) where the sparsity of $\\theta^*$, denoted by $d^* \\leq d$, is unknown to the algorithm. Defining $d^*$ as the problem complexity (similar to Foster et. al \u201919), we show that ALB achieves $\\widetilde{O}(d^*\\sqrt{T})$ regret, matching that of an oracle who knew the true sparsity level. This methodology is then extended to the case of finitely many arms and similar results are proven.

In this paper, we study the global convergence of the actor-critic algorithm for risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RSRL) with exponential utility, which remains challenging for policy optimization as it lacks the linearity needed to formulate policy gradient. To bypass such an issue of nonlinearity, we resort to the equivalence between RSRL and robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL), which is formulated as a zero-sum Markov game with a hypothetical adversary. In particular, the Nash equilibrium (NE) of such a game yields the optimal policy for RSRL, which is provably robust. We focus on a simple yet fundamental setting known as linear-quadratic (LQ) game.

In this paper, we study the global convergence of the actor-critic algorithm for risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RSRL) with exponential utility, which remains challenging for policy optimization as it lacks the linearity needed to formulate policy gradient. To bypass such an issue of nonlinearity, we resort to the equivalence between RSRL and robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL), which is formulated as a zero-sum Markov game with a hypothetical adversary. In particular, the Nash equilibrium (NE) of such a game yields the optimal policy for RSRL, which is provably robust. We focus on a simple yet fundamental setting known as linear-quadratic (LQ) game. To attain the optimal policy, we develop a nested natural actor-critic algorithm, which provably converges to the NE of the LQ game at a sublinear rate, thus solving both RSRL and RARL. To the best knowledge, the proposed nested actor-critic algorithm appears to be the \ufb01rst model-free policy optimization algorithm that provably attains the optimal policy for RSRL and RARL in the LQ setting, which sheds light on more general settings. }\n}",

However, bundling is no longer profitable if the goods have high production costs. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a new mechanism, Pure Bundling with Disposal for Cost (PBDC), where after buying the bundle, the customer is allowed to return any subset of goods for their costs. We provide two types of guarantees on the profit of PBDC mechanisms relative to the optimum in the presence of production costs, under the assumption that customers have valuations which are additive over the items and drawn independently. We first provide a distribution-dependent guarantee which shows that PBDC earns at least 1-6c^{2/3} of the optimal profit, where c denotes the coefficient of variation of the welfare random variable. c approaches 0 if there are a large number of items whose individual valuations have bounded coefficients of variation, and our constants improve upon those from the classical result of Bakos and Brynjolfsson (1999) without costs. We then provide a distribution-free guarantee which shows that either PBDC or individual sales earns at least 1/5.2 times the optimal profit, generalizing and improving the constant of 1/6 from the celebrated result of Babaioff et al.

Conversely, we also provide the best-known upper bound on the performance of any partitioning mechanism (which captures both individual sales and pure bundling), of 1/1.19 times the optimal profit, improving on the previously-known upper bound of 1/1.08.

To build a prediction model in real situations, learning from observational data with a sampling bias is a critical issue due to the lack of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data. To handle such biased observational data, recent efforts in causal inference and counterfactual machine learning have focused on debiased estimation of the potential outcomes on a binary action space and the difference between them, namely, the individual treatment effect. When it comes to a large action space (e.g., selecting an appropriate combination of medicines for a patient), however, the regression accuracy of the potential outcomes is no longer sufficient in practical terms to achieve a good decision-making performance. This is because a high mean accuracy on the large action space does not guarantee the nonexistence of a single potential outcome misestimation that misleads the whole decision. Our proposed loss minimizes the classification error of whether or not the action is relatively good for the individual target among all feasible actions, which further improves the decision-making performance, as we demonstrate.

Specifically, we study the problem of causally estimating a desired signal, generated by a linear state-space model driven by process noise, based on noisy observations of a related observation process. We define a novel regret criterion for estimator design as the difference of the estimation error energies between a clairvoyant estimator that has access to all future observations (a so-called smoother) and a causal one that only has access to current and past observations. The regret-optimal estimator is the causal estimator that minimizes the worst-case regret across all bounded-energy noise sequences. We provide a solution for the regret filtering problem at two levels. First, an horizon-independent solution at the operator level is obtained by reducing the regret to the well-known Nehari problem. Secondly, our main result for state-space models is an explicit estimator that achieves the optimal regret. The regret-optimal estimator is represented as a finite-dimensional state-space whose parameters can be computed by solving three Riccati equations and a single Lyapunov equation.

In this literature, acceleration is often supposed to be linked to the quality of the integrator (accuracy, energy preservation, symplecticity). In this work, we propose a novel ordinary differential equation that questions this connection: both the explicit and the semi-implicit (a.k.a symplectic) Euler discretizations on this ODE lead to an accelerated algorithm for convex programming.

In this model, we show that every SQ learnable class admits an efficient learning algorithm with $\\opt + \\epsilon$ misclassification error for a broad class of noise models.

This paper proposes a novel Bayesian design, SDF-Bayes, for finding the MTD for drug combinations in the presence of safety constraints. Rather than the conventional principle of escalating or de-escalating the current dose of one drug (perhaps alternating between drugs), SDF-Bayes proceeds by cautious optimism: it chooses the next DC that, on the basis of current information, is most likely to be the MTD (optimism), subject to the constraint that it only chooses DCs that have a high probability of being safe (caution). We also propose an extension, SDF-Bayes-AR, that accounts for patient heterogeneity and enables heterogeneous patient recruitment.

        "abstract": "It is important to collect credible training samples $(x,y)$ for building data-intensive learning systems (e.g., a deep learning system). Asking people to report complex distribution $p(x)$, though theoretically viable, is challenging in practice. This is primarily due to the cognitive loads required for human agents to form the report of this highly complicated information. While classical elicitation mechanisms apply to eliciting a complex and generative (and continuous) distribution $p(x)$, we are interested in eliciting samples $x_i \\sim p(x)$ from agents directly. We coin the above problem sample elicitation. This paper introduces a deep learning aided method to incentivize credible sample contributions from self-interested and rational agents. We show that with an accurate estimation of a certain $f$-divergence function we can achieve approximate incentive compatibility in eliciting truthful samples. We then present an efficient estimator with theoretical guarantees via studying the variational forms of the $f$-divergence function. We also show a connection between this sample elicitation problem and $f$-GAN, and how this connection can help reconstruct an estimator of the distribution based on collected samples. Experiments on synthetic data, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that our mechanism elicits truthful samples.

In contrast to the case of linear bandits, existing algorithms for GLB have two drawbacks undermining their applicability. First, they rely on excessively pessimistic concentration bounds due to the non-linear nature of the model.

        "abstract": "Many existing approaches for estimating feature importance are problematic because they ignore or hide dependencies among features. A causal graph, which encodes the relationships among input variables, can aid in assigning feature importance. However, current approaches that assign credit to nodes in the causal graph fail to explain the entire graph. In light of these limitations, we propose Shapley Flow, a novel approach to interpreting machine learning models. It considers the entire causal graph, and assigns credit to edges instead of treating nodes as the fundamental unit of credit assignment. Shapley Flow is the unique solution to a generalization of the Shapley value axioms for directed acyclic graphs. We demonstrate the benefit of using Shapley Flow to reason about the impact of a model\u2019s input on its output.

A causal graph, which encodes the relationships among input variables, can aid in assigning feature importance. However, current approaches that assign credit to nodes in the causal graph fail to explain the entire graph. In light of these limitations, we propose Shapley Flow, a novel approach to interpreting machine learning models. It considers the entire causal graph, and assigns credit to edges instead of treating nodes as the fundamental unit of credit assignment. Shapley Flow is the unique solution to a generalization of the Shapley value axioms for directed acyclic graphs. We demonstrate the benefit of using Shapley Flow to reason about the impact of a model\u2019s input on its output.

This problem has been studied for $\\alpha$-Holder continuous (including Lipschitz) functions with $0<\\alpha\\leq 1$. Our main result is in generalization of the reward function to Holder space with exponent $\\alpha>1$ to bridge the gap between Lipschitz bandits and infinitely-differentiable models such as linear bandits. For Holder continuous functions, approaches based on random sampling in bins of a discretized domain suffices as optimal. In contrast, we propose a class of two-layer algorithms that deploy misspecified linear/polynomial bandit algorithms in bins. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can exploit higher-order smoothness of the function by deriving a regret upper bound of $\\tilde{O}(T^\\frac{d+\\alpha}{d+2\\alpha})$ for when $\\alpha>1$, which matches existing lower bound. We also study adaptation to unknown function smoothness over a continuous scale of Holder spaces indexed by $\\alpha$, with a bandit model selection approach applied with our proposed two-layer algorithms. We show that it achieves regret rate that matches the existing lower bound for adaptation within the $\\alpha\\leq 1$ subset.",

Finally, we apply our shrinkage principle to guard against mislabeling and image noise in the human-written digit recognition problem. We add an L4-norm shrinkage layer to the original neural net and reduce the testing misclassification rate by more than 30% relatively in the presence of mislabeling and image noise. }\n}",

The goal of the learner is to transfer knowledge from the prior tasks to a similar but novel task. For $p$ parameters, size of the support set $k$, and $l$ samples per task, we show that $T \\in O((k \\log (p-k)) / l)$ tasks are sufficient in order to recover the common support of all tasks. With the recovered support, we can greatly reduce the sample complexity for estimating the parameter of the novel task, i.e., $l \\in O(1)$ with respect to $T$ and $p$. We also prove that our rates are minimax optimal. A key difference between meta-learning and the classical multi-task learning, is that meta-learning focuses only on the recovery of the parameters of the novel task, while multi-task learning estimates the parameter of all tasks, which requires $l$ to grow with $T$. Instead, our efficient meta-learning estimator allows for $l$ to be constant with respect to $T$ (i.e., few-shot learning).",

While there is much prior research, tight regret bounds of linear contextual bandit with infinite action sets remain open. In this paper, we consider the linear contextual bandit problem with (changing) infinite action sets.

Motivated by the problem of optimizing job assignments to train novice workers of unknown quality in labor platforms, we consider a new objective in the classical setup.

This corresponds to the objective of training a single, highly skilled worker using a limited supply of training jobs. For this new objective, we show that any policy must incur an instance-dependent asymptotic regret of $\\Omega(\\log T)$ (with a higher instance-dependent constant compared to the traditional objective) and an instance-independent regret of $\\Omega(K^{1/3}T^{2/3})$. We then design an explore-then-commit policy, featuring exploration based on appropriately tuned confidence bounds on the mean reward and an adaptive stopping criterion, which adapts to the problem difficulty and achieves these bounds (up to logarithmic factors).

We extend\u00a0\\citet{tian2019student} in the case of low-rank input data and show that \\emph{student specialization} (trained student neuron is highly correlated with certain teacher neuron at the same layer) still happens within the input subspace, but the teacher and student nodes could \\emph{differ wildly} out of the data subspace, which we conjecture leads to adversarial examples. Extensive experiments show that student specialization correlates strongly with model robustness in different scenarios, including student trained via standard training, adversarial training, confidence-calibrated adversarial training, and training with robust feature dataset. Our studies could shed light on the future exploration about adversarial examples, and enhancing model robustness via principled data augmentation. }\n}",

In this work, we propose the variational selective autoencoder (VSAE), a general framework to learn representations from partially-observed heterogeneous data.

After factorizing the joint distribution into conditional distributions of each variable, given its parents (the \"causal mechanisms\"), we attribute the change to changes of these causal mechanisms. This attribution analysis accounts for the fact that mechanisms often change independently and sometimes only some of them change.
