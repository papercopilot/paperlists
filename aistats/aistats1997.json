An often-used approximation for this estimate is obtained by selecting a single model structure and averaging over its parameters. The approximation is useful because it is computationally efficient, and because it provides a model that facilitates understanding\u00b7 of the domain. A common criterion for model selection is the posterior probability of the model. Another criterion for model selection, proposed by San Martini and Spezzafari (1984) , is the predictive performance of a model for the next observation to be seen. From the standpoint of domain understanding, both criteria are useful, because one identifies the model that is most likely, whereas the other identifies the model that is the best predictor of the next observation. To highlight the difference, we refer to the posterior-probability and alternative criteria as the \\emph{scientific criterion} (SC) and \\emph{engineering criterion} (EC), respectively. When we are interested in predicting the next observation, the model-averaged estimate is at least as good as that produced by EC, which itself is at least as good as the estimate produced by SC. We show experimentally that, for Bayesian-network models containing discrete variables only, differences in predictive performance between the model-averaged estimate and EC and between EC and SC can be substantial.",

To address this problem, research into combining classifiers has increased significantly in the last few years (Breiman 1992; Wolpert 1992; Breiman 1994). These methods are of two basic types: concatenation uses the output from one classifier as input to the next classifier; parallel classifiers work on the same input data with the output from each classifier combined using regression or vote-counting techniques (Schurman 1996). These strategies greatly improve the predictive power of unstable classifiers. However, when the goal of the statistical analysis is to learn about the relationship between outcome and predictors, these strategies for combining classifiers are unacceptable since they produce a large number of trees, making interpretation difficult. We present a new method for combining classification trees which results in a single, interpretable tree. We begin by defining a distance metric between two trees based on the amount of rearrangement needed so that the structure of the two trees is identical. Using this distance metric, we develop the concept of the central, or median, tree structure and estimate it using a consensus rule. This tree is seen to be more centrally located than the tree fit to all the data. We finish by discussing future work including alternative methods for estimating the median tree, probability models, uses in data mining and meta-analysis, and performance measurements of the median tree.",

        "author": "David Jensen",
        "abstract": "Overfitting is a widely observed pathology of induction algorithms. Overfitted models contain unnecessary structure that reflects nothing more than random variation in the data sample used to construct the model. Portions of these models are literally wrong, and can mislead users. Overfitted models are less efficient to store and use than their correctly-sized counterparts. Finally, overfitting can reduce the accuracy of induced models on new data [14, 7]. For induction algorithms that build decision trees [1, 13, 15], pruning is a common approach to correct overfitting. Pruning techniques take an induced tree, examine individual subtrees, and remove those subtrees deemed to be unnecessary. While pruning techniques can differ in several respects, they primarily differ in the criterion used to judge subtrees. Many criteria have been proposed, including statistical significance tests [13], corrected error estimates [15], and minimum description length calculations [12]. Most common pruning techniques, however, do not account for one potentially important factor - multiple testing. Multiple testing occurs whenever an induction algorithm examines several candidate models and selects the one that best accords with the data. Any search process necessarily involves multiple testing, and most common induction algorithms involve implicit or explicit search through a space of candidate models. In the case of decision trees, search involves examining many possible subtrees and selecting the best one. Pruning techniques need to account for the number of subtrees examined, because such multiple testing affects the apparent accuracy of models on training data [8]. This paper examines the importance of adjusting for multiple testing. Specifically, it examines the effectiveness of one particular pruning method - \\emph{bonferroni pruning}. Bonferroni pruning adjusts the results of a standard significance test to account for the number of subtrees examined at a particular node of a decision tree. Evidence that bonferroni pruning leads to better models supports the hypothesis that multiple testing is an important cause of overfitting.",

Triangulation is a combinatorial optimization problem; our idea is to embed its discrete domain into a continuous domain e.

In a large part this resurgence of interest has been stimulated by the novelty of multi-layer feedforward neural networks (Hertz et al, 1991; Ripley, 1996) and similar complex and flexible models such as MARS (Friedman, 1991), projection pursuit regression (Friedman and Stuetzle, 1981), and additive models in general (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990)). The flexibility of these models is in striking contrast to the simplicity of models such as simple linear discriminant analysis, perceptrons, and logistic discriminant analysis, which assume highly restricted forms of decision surface. The merit of the flexibility of neural networks is countered by the dangers that they will overfit the design data. This relationship between model flexibility and the danger of overfitting has long been understood within the statistical community.

In recent years the risk has been recognised, and some sophisticated proposals have been made for overcoming the problem.

It can reduce error by accounting for model uncertainty in a principled way, and its usefulness in several areas has been empirically verified. However, few attempts to apply it to rule induction have been made. This paper reports a series of experiments designed to test the utility of BMA in this field. BMA is applied to combining multiple rule sets learned from different subsets of the training data, to combining multiple rules covering a test example, to inducing technical rules for foreign exchange trading, and to inducing conjunctive concepts. In the first two cases, BMA is observed to produce lower accuracies than the ad hoc methods it is compared with. In the last two cases, BMA is observed to typically produce the same result as simply using the best (maximum-likelihood) rule, even though averaging is performed over all possible rules in the space, the domains are highly noisy, and the samples are medium- to small-sized. In all cases, this is observed to be due to BMA\u2019s consistent tendency to assign highly asymmetric weights to different models, even when their accuracy differs by little, with most models (often all but one) effectively having no influence on the outcome. Thus the effective number of models being averaged is much smaller for BMA than for common ad hoc methods, leading to a smaller reduction in variance. This suggests that the success of the multiple models approach to rule induction is primarily due to this variance reduction, and not to its being a closer approximation to the Bayesian ideal.",

        "abstract": "Cross-validation is a well-known technique in supervised learning to select a model from a family of candidate models. Examples include selecting the best classification tree using cross-validated classification error (Breiman et al., 1984) and variable selection in linear regression using cross-validated predictive squared error (Hjort, 1995). Cross-validation is less seldomly used in \\emph{unsupervised} learning such as clustering. It is popular in kernel density estimation for choosing the smoothing parameter (the kernel bandwidth).

        "abstract": "The use of acyclic, directed graphs (often called \u2019DAG\u2019s) to simultaneously represent causal hypotheses and to encode independence and conditional independence constraints associated with those hypotheses has proved fruitful in the construction of expert systems, in the development of efficient updating algorithms (Pearl, 1988, Lauritzen et al. 1988), and in inferring causal structure (Pearl and Verma, 1991; Cooper and Herskovits 1992; Spirtes, Glymour and Scheines, 1993). In section 1 I will survey a number of extensions of the DAG framework based on directed graphs and chain graphs (Lauritzen and Wermuth 1989; Frydenberg 1990; Koster 1996; Andersson, Madigan and Perlman 1996). Those based on directed graphs include models based on directed cyclic and acyclic graphs, possibly including latent variables and/or selection bias (Pearl, 1988; Spirtes, Glymour and Scheines 1993; Spirtes 1995; Spirtes, Meek, and Richardson 1995; Richardson 1996a, 1996b; Koster 1996; Pearl and Dechter 1996; Cox and Wermuth, 1996). In section 2 I state two properties, motivated by causal and spatial intuitions, that the set of conditional independencies entailed by a graphical model might satisfy. I proceed to show that the sets of independencies entailed by (i) an undirected graph via separation, and (ii) a (cyclic or acyclic) directed graph (possibly with latent and/or selection variables) via ct-separation, satisfy both properties. By contrast neither of these properties, in general, will hold in a chain graph under the Lauritzen-Wermuth-Frydenberg (LWF) interpretation. One property holds for chain graphs under the Andersson-Madigan-Perlman (AMP) interpretation, the other does not. The examination of these properties and others like them may provide insight into the current vigorous debate concerning the applicability of chain graphs under different global Markov properties.",

Previous studies have shown minimum message length (MML) estimation to perform well in a wide variety of mixture modelling problems, including determining the number of com- ponents which best describes some data.

An advantage of the probabilistic mixture modelling approach is its ability to identify models where the components overlap and data items can belong prob- abilistically to more than one component.

For example, in telecommunications industry repeatedly decisions are made every day for fraud detection and account treatment. Indicators (variables) that have large uncertainties are used to make these decisions. Furthermore, the consequences of such decisions are recorded for later analysis. Similarly, in the financial industry, stocks or currencies are traded based on some indicators (variables). The consequences of these trade can be found. Similarly in the medicine, the patient treatment decisions are made on the basis of the patient information, and the consequences of these decisions to the patients can be found. These data sets contain uncertain variables, decision variables, and value lottery (final outcomes). Furthermore these decisions may not be made not by a single decision maker, but by many decision makers. In contrast to a typical decision analysis, in these environments decisions are made repeatedly. This paper addresses the discovery of knowledge bearing on these decisions in the form of influence diagrams (normative decision models) using a novel supervised machine learning method that constructs Bayesian network models with decisions. Algorithms presented in this paper exploit the goal oriented characteristics o f influence diagrams and generate a specific form of influence diagrams that are efficient, both to learn and evaluate.

Previous studies have shown minimum message length (MML) estimation to perform well in a wide variety of mixture modelling problems, including determining the number of components which best describes some data.

An advantage of the probabilistic mixture modelling approach is its ability to identify models where the components overlap and data items can belong probabilistically to more than one component. Significantly overlapping distributions require more data for their parameters to be accurately estimated than well separated distributions. For example, two Gaussian distributions are considered to significantly overlap when their means are within three standard deviations of each other.

In this paper, we quantify this difficulty in terms of the number of data items needed for the MML criterion to \u2019discover\u2019 two overlapping components. First, we perform experiments which compare the MML criterion\u2019s performance relative to other Bayesian criteria based on MCMC sampling.

During the past few years, Artificial Intelligence met\u00b7Statistics in the quest to develop effective methods to learn BBNs directly from databases. Unfortunately, real-world databases include missing and/or unreported data whose presence challenges traditional learning techniques, from both the theoretical and computational point of view. This paper introduces a new method to learn the probabilities defining a BBNs from databases with missing data.

This implies that decreases in tree size obtained by more sophisticated data reduction techniques should be decomposed into two parts: that which is due to reduction of training set size, and the remainder, which is due to how the method selects instances to discard.

        "abstract": "The GBI (graph-based induction) concept learning method is applied to extract typical access patterns of WWW data. By interpreting extracted patterns as the cache site layout we can reduce the total network data flow by implementing a distributed cache system which is adapted to the WWW access patterns. Although the huge WWW data flow causes the overflow of the conventional hierarchical cache system, the layout created by the GBI method eases this problem. The traffic reduction ratio of this distributed cache system is 2.5 times higher than that of the conventional hierarchical cache system. Our results suggest the importance of the data analyzing methods which can handle structured data. By analyzing regularity in graph structures, the GBI method can reduce the network data flow; The statistical criteria contribute to the analysis of promising patterns",
