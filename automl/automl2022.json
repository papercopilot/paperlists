However, often there exist semantic ordinal relationships among the categorical values, such as: quality level (i.e., [\u2019very good\u2019 $\\succ$ \u2019good\u2019 $\\succ$ \u2019normal\u2019 $\\succ$ \u2019poor\u2019]), or month (i.e., [\u2019Jan\u2019 $\\prec$ \u2019Feb\u2019 $\\prec$ \u2019Mar\u2019]).

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) offers the potential for training generally capable agents that can interact autonomously in the real world. However, one key limitation is the brittleness of RL algorithms to core hyperparameters and network architecture choice. Furthermore, non-stationarities such as evolving training data and increased agent complexity mean that different hyperparameters and architectures may be optimal at different points of training. This motivates AutoRL, a class of methods seeking to automate these design choices. One prominent class of AutoRL methods is Population-Based Training (PBT), which have led to impressive performance in several large scale settings. In this paper, we introduce two new innovations in PBT-style methods. First, we employ trust-region based Bayesian Optimization, enabling full coverage of the high-dimensional mixed hyperparameter search space. Second, we show that using a generational approach, we can also learn both architectures and hyperparameters jointly on-the-fly in a single training run. Leveraging the new highly parallelizable Brax physics engine, we show that these innovations lead to dramatic performance gains, significantly outperforming the tuned baseline while learning entire configurations on the fly.",

However, one key limitation is the brittleness of RL algorithms to core hyperparameters and network architecture choice. Furthermore, non-stationarities such as evolving training data and increased agent complexity mean that different hyperparameters and architectures may be optimal at different points of training. This motivates AutoRL, a class of methods seeking to automate these design choices. One prominent class of AutoRL methods is Population-Based Training (PBT), which have led to impressive performance in several large scale settings. In this paper, we introduce two new innovations in PBT-style methods. First, we employ trust-region based Bayesian Optimization, enabling full coverage of the high-dimensional mixed hyperparameter search space. Second, we show that using a generational approach, we can also learn both architectures and hyperparameters jointly on-the-fly in a single training run.

Various meta-learning schemes have been proposed over the last decade (and more) for this problem. In this paper, we theoretically analyse the optimality gap of the hyperparameter obtained via such warm-started few-shot HPO, and provide novel results for multiple existing meta-learning schemes.

The flexible RPC-based infrastructure allows users to access OSS Vizier from binaries written in any language.

We use ScaleNAS to create high-resolution models for two different tasks, ScaleNet-P for human pose estimation and ScaleNet-S for semantic segmentation.

We resolve this discrepancy by formulating the multi-objective NAS problem as a quality diversity optimization (QDO) problem and introduce three quality diversity NAS optimizers (two of them belonging to the group of multifidelity optimizers), which search for high-performing yet diverse architectures that are optimal for application-specific niches, e.g., hardware constraints.

By decomposing it into triggers and initializations, we introduce a framework for studying the various facets of neurogenesis: when, where, and how to add neurons during the learning process. We present the Neural Orthogonality (NORTH*) suite of neurogenesis strategies, combining layer-wise triggers and initializations based on the orthogonality of activations or weights to dynamically grow performant networks that converge to an efficient size. We evaluate our contributions against other recent neurogenesis works across a variety of supervised learning tasks.",

In this work, we propose a new set of challenging and relevant benchmark problems motivated by desirable properties and requirements for such benchmarks. Our new surrogate-based benchmark collection consists of 14 scenarios that in total constitute over 700 multi-fidelity hyperparameter optimization problems, which all enable multi-objective hyperparameter optimization. Furthermore, we empirically compare surrogate-based benchmarks to the more widely-used tabular benchmarks, and demonstrate that the latter may produce unfaithful results regarding the performance ranking of HPO methods. We examine and compare our benchmark collection with respect to defined requirements and propose a single-objective as well as a multi-objective benchmark suite on which we compare 7 single-objective and 7 multi-objective optimizers in a benchmark experiment.
