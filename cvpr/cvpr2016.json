        "abstract": "We propose a human pose representation model that transfers human poses acquired from different unknown views to a view-invariant high-level space. The model is a deep convolutional neural network and requires a large corpus of multiview training data which is very expensive to acquire. Therefore, we propose a method to generate this data by fitting synthetic 3D human models to real motion capture data and rendering the human poses from numerous viewpoints. While learning the CNN model, we do not use action labels but only the pose labels after clustering all training poses into k clusters. The proposed model is able to generalize to real depth images of unseen poses without the need for re-training or fine-tuning. Real depth videos are passed through the model frame-wise to extract view-invariant features. For spatio-temporal representation, we propose group sparse Fourier Temporal Pyramid which robustly encodes the action specific most discriminative output features of the proposed human pose model. Experiments on two multiview and three single-view benchmark datasets show that the proposed method dramatically outperforms existing state-of-the-art in action recognition.",

The motion model is adaptive and directed according to a simple yet powerful occlusion handling paradigm, which is intrinsically fused  in the motion model. Also, since 3D trackers are sensitive to synchronization and registration noise in the RGB and depth streams, we propose automated methods to solve these two issues. Extensive experiments are conducted on a popular RGBD tracking benchmark, which demonstrate that our tracker can achieve superior results, outperforming many other recent and state-of-the-art RGBD trackers.",

        "abstract": "Estimating the shape of transparent and refractive objects is one of the few open problems in 3D reconstruction. Under the assumption that the rays refract only twice when traveling through the object, we present the first approach to simultaneously reconstructing the 3D positions and normals of the object's surface at both refraction locations. Our acquisition setup requires only two cameras and one monitor, which serves as the light source. After acquiring the ray-ray correspondences between each camera and the monitor, we solve an optimization function which enforces a new position-normal consistency constraint. That is, the 3D positions of surface points shall agree with the normals required to refract the rays under Snell's law. Experimental results using both synthetic and real data demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method for semantic parsing the 3D point cloud of an entire building using a hierarchical approach: first, the raw data is parsed into semantically meaningful spaces (e.g. rooms, etc) that are aligned into a canonical reference coordinate system. Second, the spaces are parsed into their structural and building elements (e.g. walls, columns, etc). Performing these with a strong notation of global 3D space is the backbone of our method. The alignment in the first step injects strong 3D priors from the canonical coordinate system into the second step for dis- covering elements. This allows diverse challenging scenarios as man-made indoor spaces often show recurrent geo- metric patterns while the appearance features can change drastically. We also argue that identification of structural elements in indoor spaces is essentially a detection problem, rather than segmentation which is commonly used. We evaluated our method on a new dataset of several buildings with a covered area of over 6, 000m2 and over 215 million points, demonstrating robust results readily useful for practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic relocalization of 6D camera pose from single reference image is a costly and challenging task that requires delicate hand-eye calibration and precision positioning platform to do 3D mechanical rotation and translation. In this paper, we show that high-quality camera relocalization can be achieved in a much less expensive way. Based on inexpensive platform with unreliable absolute repositioning accuracy (ARA), we propose a hand-eye calibration free strategy to actively relocate camera into the same 6D pose that produces the input reference image, by sequentially correcting 3D relative rotation and translation. We theoretically prove that, by this strategy, both rotational and translational relative pose can be effectively reduced to zero, with bounded unknown hand-eye pose displacement. To conquer 3D rotation and translation ambiguity, this theoretical strategy is further revised to a practical relocalization algorithm with faster convergence rate and more reliability by jointly adjusting 3D relative rotation and translation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superior accuracy of the proposed approach on laboratory tests and challenging real-world applications.",

To the best of our knowledge LSFM is the largest-scale Morphable Model ever constructed, containing statistical information from a huge variety of the human population. To build such a large model we introduce a novel fully automated and robust Morphable Model construction pipeline. The dataset that LSFM is trained on includes rich demographic information about each subject, allowing for the construction of not only a global 3DMM but also models tailored for specific age, gender or ethnicity groups. As an application example, we utilise the proposed model to perform age classification from 3D shape alone. Furthermore, we perform a systematic analysis of the constructed 3DMMs that showcases their quality and descriptive power. The presented extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveal that the proposed 3DMM achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing models by a large margin. Finally, for the benefit of the research community, we make publicly available the source code of the proposed automatic 3DMM construction pipeline. In addition, the constructed global 3DMM and a variety of bespoke models tailored by age, gender and ethnicity are available on application to researchers involved in medically oriented research.",

At the same time, legacy datasets may impend the evolution of a field due to saturated algorithm performance and the lack of contemporary, high quality data. In this work we present a new benchmark dataset and evaluation methodology for the area of video object segmentation. The dataset, named DAVIS (Densely Annotated VIdeo Segmentation), consists of fifty high quality, Full HD video sequences, spanning multiple occurrences of common video object segmentation challenges such as occlusions, motion-blur and appearance changes. Each video is accompanied by densely annotated, pixel-accurate and per-frame ground truth segmentation. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of several state-of-the-art segmentation approaches using three complementary metrics that measure the spatial extent of the segmentation, the accuracy of the silhouette contours and the temporal coherence. The results uncover strengths and weaknesses of current approaches, opening up promising directions for future works.",

        "abstract": "Numerous single image blind deblurring algorithms have been proposed to restore latent sharp images under camera motion. However, these algorithms are mainly evaluated using either synthetic datasets or few selected real blurred images. It is thus unclear how these algorithms would perform on images acquired \"in the wild\" and how we could gauge the progress in the field. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap. We present the first comprehensive perceptual study and analysis of single image blind deblurring using real-world blurred images. First, we collect a dataset of real blurred images and a dataset of synthetically blurred images. Using these datasets, we conduct a large-scale user study to quantify the performance of several representative state-of-the-art blind deblurring algorithms. Second, we systematically analyze subject preferences, including the level of agreement, significance tests of score differences, and rationales for preferring one method over another. Third, we study the correlation between human subjective scores and several full-reference and no-reference image quality metrics. Our evaluation and analysis indicate the performance gap between synthetically blurred images and real blurred image and sheds light on future research in single image blind deblurring.",

In its conventional formulation, the complexity of existing solvers scale poorly with problem size, hence this component of the Structure-from-Motion pipeline can quickly become a bottle-neck. Here we present a novel formulation for solving bundle adjustment in a truly distributed manner using consensus based optimization methods. Our algorithm is presented with a concise derivation based on proximal splitting, along with a theoretical proof of convergence and brief discussions on complexity and implementation. Experiments on a number of real image datasets convincingly demonstrates the potential of the proposed method by outperforming the conventional bundle adjustment formulation by orders of magnitude.",

We probabilistically assign each point in space to an object with a theoretical modeling of the reflection and transmission probabilities for the corresponding camera ray. Our modeling is unified in handling occlusions across a variety of scenarios, such as associating structure from motion point tracks with potentially occluded objects or modeling object detection scores in applications such as 3D localization. For point track association, our model uniformly handles static and dynamic objects, which is an advantage over motion segmentation approaches traditionally used in multibody SFM. Detailed experiments on the KITTI dataset show the superiority of the proposed method over both state-of-the-art motion segmentation and a baseline that heuristically uses detection bounding boxes for resolving occlusions. We also demonstrate how our continuous occlusion model may be applied to the task of 3D localization in road scenes.",

The overarching goal of the paper is to identify high level considerations relevant to deriving more sophisticated visual saliency models. A deep learning model based on fully convolutional networks (FCNs) is presented, which shows very favorable performance across a wide variety of benchmarks relative to existing proposals. We also demonstrate that the manner in which training data is selected, and ground truth treated is critical to resulting model behaviour. Recent efforts have explored the relationship between human gaze and salient objects, and we also examine this point further in the context of FCNs. Close examination of the proposed and alternative models serves as a vehicle for identifying problems important to developing more comprehensive models going forward.",

The basic idea is to construct a proper objective function with respect to the target variables and extract all its stationary points so as to find the global minimum. The advantages of our proposed solution over existing ones are that (i) the objective function is directly built upon the imaging equation, such that all the 3D-to-2D correspondences are treated with balance, and that (ii) the proposed solution is noniterative, in the sense that the stationary points are retrieved by means of standard eigenvalue factorization and the common iterative refinement step is not needed. In addition, the proposed solution has (O(n)) complexity, and can be used to handle both planar and nonplanar 3D points. Experimental results have shown that the proposed solution is much more accurate than the existing state-of-the-art solutions, and is even comparable to the maximum likelihood estimation by minimizing the reprojection error.",

In particular, collecting large amounts of training data that contain unconstrained images and are annotated with accurate 3D poses is infeasible. We therefore propose to use two independent training sources. The first source consists of images with annotated 2D poses and the second source consists of accurate 3D motion capture data. To integrate both sources, we propose a dual-source approach that combines 2D pose estimation with efficient and robust 3D pose retrieval. In our experiments, we show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results and is even competitive when the skeleton structure of the two sources differ substantially.",

Specifically, we represent a 3D shape in a Markov random field (MRF) in which the geometric information is encoded by random binary variables and the appearance information is retrieved from a set of RGB images captured at multiple viewpoints. The local priors in the MRF model capture the local structures of object shapes and are learnt from 3D shape templates using a convolutional deep belief network. Repairing a 3D shape is formulated as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation in the corresponding MRF. Variational mean field approximation technique is adopted for the MAP estimation. The proposed method was evaluated on both artificial data and real data obtained from reconstruction of practical scenes. Experimental results have shown the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method in repairing noisy and incomplete 3D shapes.",

Our model is also able to perform spatio-temporal annotation of the atomic actions that compose the overall complex action. That is, for each atomic action, the model generates temporal atomic action annotations by inferring the starting and ending times of the atomic action, as well spatial annotations by inferring the human body parts that are involved in each atomic action. Our model has three key properties: (i) it can be trained with no spatial supervision, as it is able to automatically discover the relevant body parts from temporal action annotations only; (ii) its jointly learned poselet and actionlet representation encodes the visual variability of actions with good generalization power; (iii) its mechanism for handling noisy body pose estimates make it robust to common pose estimation errors. We experimentally evaluate the performance of our method in multiple action recognition benchmarks. Our model consistently outperform baselines and state-of-the-art action recognition methods.",

        "abstract": "The depth image based rendering (DIBR) plays a key role in 3D video synthesis, by which other virtual views can be generated from a 2D video and its depth map. However, in the synthesis process, the background occluded by the foreground objects might be exposed in the new view, resulting in some holes in the synthetized video. In this paper, a hole filling approach based on background reconstruction is proposed, in which the temporal correlation information in both the 2D video and its corresponding depth map are exploited to construct a background video. To construct a clean background video, the foreground objects are detected and removed. Also motion compensation is applied to make the background reconstruction model suitable for moving camera scenario. Each frame is projected to the current plane where a modified Gaussian mixture model is performed. The constructed background video is used to eliminate the holes in the synthetized video. Our experimental results have indicated that the proposed approach has better quality of the synthetized 3D video compared with the other methods.",

        "abstract": "Modelling and analyzing noise in images is a fundamental task in many computer vision systems. Traditionally, noise has been modelled per color channel assuming that the color channels are independent. Although the color channels can be considered as mutually independent in camera RAW images, signals from different color channels get mixed during the imaging process inside the camera due to gamut mapping, tone-mapping, and compression. We show the influence of the in-camera imaging pipeline on noise and propose a new noise model in the 3D RGB space to accounts for the color channel mix-ups. A data-driven approach for determining the parameters of the new noise model is introduced as well as its application to image denoising. The experiments show that our noise model represents the noise in regular JPEG images more accurately compared to the previous models and is advantageous in image denoising.",

        "abstract": "Recently, deep learning approaches have demonstrated remarkable progresses for action recognition in videos. Most existing deep frameworks equally treat every volume i.e. spatial-temporal video clip, and directly assign a video label to all volumes sampled from it. However, within a video, discriminative actions may occur sparsely in a few key volumes, and most other volumes are irrelevant to the labeled action category. Training with a large proportion of irrelevant volumes will hurt performance. To address this issue, we propose a key volume mining deep framework to identify key volumes and conduct classification simultaneously. Specifically, our framework is trained end-to-end in an EM-like loop. In the forward pass, our network mines key volumes for each action class. In the backward pass, it updates network parameters with the help of these mined key volumes. In addition, we propose \"Stochastic out\" to handle key volumes from multi-modalities, and an effective yet simple \"unsupervised key volume proposal\" method for high quality volume sampling. Our experiments show that action recognition performance can be significantly improved by mining key volumes, and our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on UCF101 (93.1%).",

Training of the so-called FlowNet was enabled by a large synthetically generated dataset. The present paper extends the concept of optical flow estimation via convolutional networks to disparity and scene flow estimation.  To this end, we propose three synthetic stereo video datasets with sufficient realism, variation, and size to successfully train large networks.  Our datasets are the first large-scale datasets to enable training and evaluation of scene flow methods.  Besides the datasets, we present a convolutional network for real-time disparity estimation that provides state-of-the-art results. By combining a flow and disparity estimation network and training it jointly, we demonstrate the first scene flow estimation with a convolutional network.",

Through experiments, we show that the information available at each of these distinct contextual levels provides complementary cues as to person identities.  At the person level, we leverage clothing and body appearance in addition to facial appearance, and to compensate for instances where the faces are not visible.  At the photo level we leverage a learned prior on the joint distribution of identities on the same photo to guide the identity assignments. Going beyond a single photo, we are able to infer natural groupings of photos with shared context in an unsupervised manner. By exploiting this shared contextual information, we are able to reduce the identity search space and exploit higher intra-personal appearance consistency within photo groups. Our new framework enables efficient use of these complementary multi-level contextual cues to improve overall recognition rates on the photo album person recognition task, as demonstrated through state-of-the-art results on a challenging public dataset.  Our results outperform competing methods by a significant margin, while being computationally efficient and practical in a real world application.",

        "abstract": "We present a multi-stream bi-directional recurrent neural network for fine-grained action detection. Recently, two-stream convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on stacked optical flow and image frames have been successful for action recognition in videos. Our system uses a tracking algorithm to locate a bounding box around the person, which provides a frame of reference for appearance and motion and also suppresses background noise that is not within the bounding box.  We train two additional streams on motion and appearance cropped to the tracked bounding box, along with full-frame streams.  Our motion streams use pixel trajectories of a frame as raw features, in which the displacement values corresponding to a moving scene point are at the same spatial position across several frames.  To model long-term temporal dynamics within and between actions, the multi-stream CNN is followed by a bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer.  We show that our bi-directional LSTM network utilizes about 8 seconds of the video sequence to predict an action label. We test on two action detection datasets: the MPII Cooking 2 Dataset, and a new MERL Shopping Dataset that we introduce and make available to the community with this paper.  The results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art action detection methods on both datasets.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new curvature penalized minimal path model for image segmentation via closed contour detection based on the weighted Euler elastica curves, firstly introduced to the field of computer vision in [22]. Our image segmentation method extracts a collection of curvature penalized minimal geodesics, concatenated to form a closed contour, by connecting a set of user-specified points. Globally optimal minimal paths can be computed by solving an Eikonal equation. This first order PDE is traditionally regarded as unable to penalize curvature, which is related to the path acceleration in active contour models. We introduce here a new approach that enables finding a global minimum of the geodesic energy including a curvature term. We achieve this through the use of a novel Finsler metric adding to the image domain the orientation as an extra space dimension. This metric is non-Riemannian and asymmetric, defined on an orientation lifted space, incorporating the curvature penalty in the geodesic energy. Experiments show that the proposed Finsler minimal path model indeed outperforms state-of-the-art minimal path models in both synthetic and real images.",

        "abstract": "Regression is an essential tool in Statistical analysis of data with many applications in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Medical Imaging and various disciplines of Science and Engineering. Linear and nonlinear regression in a vector space setting has been well studied in literature. However, generalizations to manifold-valued data are only recently gaining popularity. With the exception of a few, most existing methods of regression for manifold valued data are limited to geodesic regression which is a generalization of the linear regression in vector-spaces. In this paper, we present a novel nonlinear kernel-based regression method that is applicable to manifold valued data. Our method is applicable to cases when the independent and dependent variables in the regression model are both manifold-valued or one is manifold-valued and the other is vector or scalar valued. Further, unlike most methods, our method does not require any imposed ordering on the manifold-valued data. The performance of our model is tested on a large number of real data sets acquired from Alzhiemers and movement disorder (Parkinsons and Essential Tremor) patients. We present an extensive set of results along with statistical validation and comparisons.",

        "abstract": "In many sub-fields, researchers collect datasets of human ground truth that are used to create a new algorithm. For example, in research on image perception, datasets have been collected for topics such as what makes an image aesthetic or memorable. Despite high costs for human data collection, datasets are infrequently reused beyond their own fields of interest. Moreover, the algorithms built from them are domain-specific (predict a small set of attributes) and usually unconnected to one another. In this paper, we present a paradigm for building generalized and expandable models of human image perception. First, we fuse multiple fragmented and partially-overlapping datasets through data imputation. We then create a theoretically-structured statistical model of human image perception that is fit to the fused datasets. The resulting model has many advantages. (1) It is generalized, going beyond the content of the constituent datasets, and can be easily expanded by fusing additional datasets. (2) It provides a new ontology usable as a network to expand human data in a cost-effective way. (3) It can guide the design of a generalized computational algorithm for multi-dimensional visual perception. Indeed, experimental results show that a model-based algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods on predicting visual sentiment, visual realism and interestingness. Our paradigm can be used in various visual tasks (e.g., video summarization).",

        "abstract": "Conventional representation based classifiers, ranging from the classical nearest neighbor classifier and nearest subspace classifier to the recently developed sparse representation based classifier (SRC) and collaborative representation based classifier (CRC), are essentially distance based classifiers. Though SRC and CRC have shown interesting classification results, their intrinsic classification mechanism remains unclear. In this paper we propose a probabilistic collaborative representation framework, where the probability that a test sample belongs to the collaborative subspace of all classes can be well defined and computed. Consequently, we present a probabilistic collaborative representation based classifier (ProCRC), which jointly maximizes the likelihood that a test sample belongs to each of the multiple classes. The final classification is performed by checking which class has the maximum likelihood. The proposed ProCRC has a clear probabilistic interpretation, and it shows superior performance to many popular classifiers, including SRC, CRC and SVM. Coupled with the CNN features, it also leads to state-of-the-art classification results on a variety of challenging visual datasets.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, sensors capable of measuring both color and depth information have become increasingly popular. Despite the abundance of colored point set data, state-of-the-art probabilistic registration techniques ignore the available color information. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic point set registration framework that exploits available color information associated with the points. Our method is based on a model of the joint distribution of 3D-point observations and their color information. The proposed model captures discriminative color information, while being computationally efficient. We derive an EM algorithm for jointly estimating the model parameters and the relative transformations.  Comprehensive experiments are performed on the Stanford Lounge dataset, captured by an RGB-D camera, and two point sets captured by a Lidar sensor. Our results demonstrate a significant gain in robustness and accuracy when incorporating color information. On the Stanford Lounge dataset, our approach achieves a relative reduction of the failure rate by 78% compared to the baseline. Furthermore, our proposed model outperforms standard strategies for combining color and 3D-point information, leading to state-of-the-art results.",

        "abstract": "Multilinear models are widely used to represent the statistical variations of 3D human faces as they decouple shape changes due to identity and expression. Existing methods to learn a multilinear face model degrade if not every person is captured in every expression, if face scans are noisy or partially occluded, if expressions are erroneously labeled, or if the vertex correspondence is inaccurate. These limitations impose requirements on the training data that disqualify large amounts of available 3D face data from being usable to learn a multilinear model. To overcome this, we introduce the first framework to robustly learn a multilinear model from 3D face databases with missing data, corrupt data, wrong semantic correspondence, and inaccurate vertex correspondence. To achieve this robustness to erroneous training data, our framework jointly learns a multilinear model and fixes the data. We evaluate our framework on two publicly available 3D face databases, and show that our framework achieves a data completion accuracy that is comparable to state-of-the-art tensor completion methods. Our method reconstructs corrupt data more accurately than state-of-the-art methods, and improves the quality of the learned model significantly for erroneously labeled expressions.",

These applications, unlike general scene understanding, are task oriented and require specific information from visual data.

In this paper, we propose a novel cost-sensitive task-oriented recognition method that is based on a combination of linguistic semantics and visual cues.

        "abstract": "We propose a system that finds text in natural scenes using a variety of cues. Our novel data-driven method incorporates coarse-to-fine detection of character pixels using convolutional features (Text-Conv), followed by extracting connected components (CCs) from characters using edge and color features, and finally performing a graph-based segmentation of CCs into words (Word-Graph). For Text-Conv, the initial detection is based on convolutional feature maps similar to those used in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), but learned using Convolutional k-means. Convolution masks defined by local and neighboring patch features are used to improve detection accuracy. The Word-Graph algorithm uses contextual information to both improve word segmentation and prune false character/word detections. Different definitions for foreground (text) regions are used to train the detection stages, some based on bounding box intersection, and others on bounding box and pixel intersection. Our system obtains pixel, character, and word detection f-measures of 93.14%, 90.26%, and 86.77% respectively for the ICDAR 2015 Robust Reading Focused Scene Text dataset, out-performing state-of-the-art systems. This approach may work for other detection targets with homogenous color in natural scenes.",

        "abstract": "We propose a weighted variational model to estimate both the reflectance and the illumination from an observed image. We show that, though it is widely adopted for ease of modeling, the log-transformed image for this task is not ideal. Based on the previous investigation of the logarithmic transformation, a new weighted variational model is proposed for better prior representation, which is imposed in the regularization terms. Different from conventional variational models, the proposed model can preserve the estimated reflectance with more details. Moreover, the proposed model can suppress noise to some extent. An alternating minimization scheme is adopted to solve the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model with its algorithm. Compared with other variational methods, the proposed method yields comparable or better results on both subjective and objective assessments.",

However, deep learning's power consumption and bandwidth requirements currently limit its application in embedded and mobile systems with tight energy budgets. In this paper, we explore the energy savings of optically computing the first layer of CNNs. To do so, we utilize bio-inspired Angle Sensitive Pixels (ASPs), custom CMOS diffractive image sensors which act similar to Gabor filter banks in the V1 layer of the human visual cortex. ASPs replace both image sensing and the first layer of a conventional CNN by directly performing optical edge filtering, saving sensing energy, data bandwidth, and CNN FLOPS to compute. Our experimental results (both on synthetic data and a hardware prototype) for a variety of vision tasks such as digit recognition, object recognition, and face identification demonstrate 97% reduction in image sensor power consumption and 90% reduction in data bandwidth from sensor to CPU, while achieving similar performance compared to traditional deep learning pipelines.",

In this paper we introduce a method for constructing compact generative representations of PCD at multiple levels of detail.   As opposed to deterministic structures such as voxel grids or octrees, we propose probabilistic subdivisions of the data through local mixture modeling, and show how these subdivisions can provide a maximum likelihood segmentation of the data. The final representation is hierarchical, compact, parametric, and statistically derived, facilitating run-time occupancy calculations through stochastic sampling. Unlike traditional deterministic spatial subdivision methods, our technique enables dynamic creation of voxel grids according the application's best needs.   In contrast to other generative models for PCD, we explicitly enforce sparsity among points and mixtures, a technique which we call expectation sparsification. This leads to a highly parallel hierarchical Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm well-suited for the GPU and real-time execution. We explore the trade-offs between model fidelity and model size at various levels of detail, our tests showing favorable performance when compared to octree and NDT-based methods.",

To be more robust to noise, the stability is further quantized by thresholding. The principle of maximum entropy is utilized for determining the best thresholds for maximizing discriminant power of the resultant descriptor. Accumulating stability renders a real-valued descriptor and it can be converted into a binary descriptor by an additional thresholding process. The real-valued descriptor attains high matching accuracy while the binary descriptor makes a good compromise between storage and accuracy. Our descriptors are simple yet effective, and easy to implement. In addition, our descriptors require no training. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our descriptors and their superiority to the state-of-the-art descriptors.",

With very deep networks, however, convergence speed becomes a critical issue during training. We propose a simple yet effective training procedure. We learn residuals only and use extremely high learning rates (104 times higher than SRCNN [6]) enabled by adjustable gradient clipping.

        "abstract": "This work presents an approach to category-based action recognition in video using sparse coding techniques. The proposed approach includes two main contributions: i) A new method to handle intra-class variations by decomposing each video into a reduced set of representative atomic action acts or key-sequences, and ii) A new video descriptor, ITRA: Inter-Temporal Relational Act Descriptor, that exploits the power of comparative reasoning to capture relative similarity relations among key-sequences. In terms of the method to obtain key-sequences, we introduce a loss function that, for each video, leads to the identification of a sparse set of representative key-frames capturing both, relevant particularities arising in the input video, as well as relevant generalities arising in the complete class collection. In terms of the method to obtain the ITRA descriptor, we introduce a novel scheme to quantify relative intra and inter-class similarities among local temporal patterns arising in the videos. The resulting ITRA descriptor demonstrates to be highly effective to discriminate among action categories. As a result, the proposed approach reaches remarkable action recognition performance on several popular benchmark datasets, outperforming alternative state-of-the-art techniques by a  large margin.",

Accurate and efficient estimation of actionness is important in video analysis and may benefit other relevant tasks such as action recognition and action detection. This paper presents a new deep architecture for actionness estimation, called hybrid fully convolutional network (H-FCN), which is composed of appearance FCN (A-FCN) and motion FCN (M-FCN). These two FCNs leverage the strong capacity of deep models to estimate actionness maps from the perspectives of static appearance and dynamic motion, respectively. In addition, the fully convolutional nature of H-FCN allows it to efficiently process videos with arbitrary sizes. Experiments are conducted on the challenging datasets of Stanford40, UCF Sports, and JHMDB to verify the effectiveness of H-FCN on actionness estimation, which demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance to previous ones. Moreover, we apply the estimated actionness maps on action proposal generation and action detection. Our actionness maps advance the current state-of-the-art performance of these tasks substantially.",

In this paper, we propose a novel representation for actions by modeling an action as a transformation which changes the state of the environment before the action happens (precondition) to the state after the action (effect). Motivated by recent advancements of video representation using deep learning, we design a Siamese network which models the action as a transformation on a high-level feature space. We show that our model gives improvements on standard action recognition datasets including UCF101 and HMDB51. More importantly, our approach is able to  generalize beyond learned action categories and shows significant performance improvement on cross-category generalization on our new ACT dataset.",

In order to identify images that, once annotated, will propagate well to other examples, we introduce an active selection procedure that operates on the joint segmentation graph over all images.  It prioritizes human intervention for those images that are uncertain and influential in the graph, while also mutually diverse.

The downside of this  development is that they  require annotated training data, which is tedious to produce.  In this paper,  we propose an Active Learning approach  that considerably speeds up  the annotation  process. Unlike  standard ones,  it takes  advantage of  the specificities of the delineation problem. It  operates on a graph and can reduce the training  set size  by up  to 80%  without compromising  the reconstruction quality.

Current methods based on layered CRFs for this problem are local and unable to capture the long-ranging interactions of video parts. We propose a new model that combines the labeling CRF with a supervoxel hierarchy, where supervoxels at various scales provide cues for possible groupings of nodes in the CRF to encourage adaptive and long-ranging interactions. The new model defines a dynamic and continuous process of information exchange: the CRF influences what supervoxels in the hierarchy are active, and these active supervoxels, in turn, affect the connectivities in the CRF; we hence call it a grouping process model. By further incorporating the video-level recognition, the proposed method achieves a large margin of 60% relative improvement over the state of the art on the recent A2D large-scale video labeling dataset, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our modeling.",

        "abstract": "Tracking-by-detection methods have demonstrated competitive performance in recent years. In these approaches, the tracking model heavily relies on the quality of the training set. Due to the limited amount of labeled training data, additional samples need to be extracted and labeled by the tracker itself. This often leads to the inclusion of corrupted training samples, due to occlusions, misalignments and other perturbations. Existing tracking-by-detection methods either ignore this problem, or employ a separate component for managing the training set.   We propose a novel generic approach for alleviating the problem of corrupted training samples in tracking-by-detection frameworks. Our approach dynamically manages the training set by estimating the quality of the samples. Contrary to existing approaches, we propose a unified formulation by minimizing a single loss over both the target appearance model and the sample quality weights. The joint formulation enables corrupted samples to be down-weighted while increasing the impact of correct ones. Experiments are performed on three benchmarks: OTB-2015 with 100 videos, VOT-2015 with 60 videos, and Temple-Color with 128 videos. On the OTB-2015, our unified formulation significantly improves the baseline, with a gain of 3.8% in mean overlap precision. Finally, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on all three datasets.",

Our approach is comparable in terms of accuracy to the state-of-the-art Faster R-CNN approach while using two orders of magnitude fewer anchors on average. Code is publicly available.",

From an affinity matrix describing pairwise relationships between pixels, it clusters pixels into regions, and, using a complex-valued extension, orders pixels according to layer.  We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to directly predict the pairwise relationships that define this affinity matrix.  Spectral embedding then resolves these predictions into a globally-consistent segmentation and figure/ground organization of the scene.  Experiments demonstrate significant benefit to this direct coupling compared to prior works which use explicit intermediate stages, such as edge detection, on the pathway from image to affinities.  Our results suggest spectral embedding as a powerful alternative to the conditional random field (CRF)-based globalization schemes typically coupled to deep neural networks.",

        "abstract": "Cross-modal tasks occur naturally for multimedia content that can be described along two or more modalities like visual content and text. Such tasks require to \"translate\" information from one modality to another. Methods like kernelized canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) attempt to solve such tasks by finding aligned subspaces in the description spaces of different modalities. Since they favor correlations against modality-specific information, these methods have shown some success in both cross-modal and bi-modal tasks. However, we show that a direct use of the subspace alignment obtained by KCCA only leads to coarse translation abilities. To address this problem, we first put forward here a new representation method that aggregates information provided by the projections of both modalities on their aligned subspaces. We further suggest a method relying on neighborhoods in these subspaces to complete uni-modal information. Our proposal exhibits state-of-the-art results for bi-modal classification on Pascal VOC07 and for cross-modal retrieval on FlickR 8K and FlickR 30K.",

For exactly the same image, the answers to those questions are likely to differ from person to person. This is because the task is inherently ambiguous. Such an ambiguous, therefore challenging, task is pushing the boundary of computer vision in showing what can and can not be learned from visual data. Crowdsourcing has been invaluable for collecting annotations. This is particularly so for a task that goes beyond a clear-cut dichotomy as multiple human judgments per image are needed to reach a consensus. This paper makes conceptual and technical contributions. On the conceptual side, we define disagreements among annotators as privileged information about the data instance. On the technical side, we propose a framework to incorporate annotation disagreements into the classifiers. The proposed framework is simple, relatively fast, and outperforms classifiers that do not take into account the disagreements, especially if tested on high confidence annotations.",

        "abstract": "Controlled light conditions improve considerably the performance of most computer vision algorithms. Dynamic light conditions create varying spatial changes in color and intensity across the scene. These condition, caused by a moving shadow for example, force developers to create algorithms which are robust to such variations. We suggest a computational camera which produces images that are not influenced by environmental variations in light conditions. The key insight is that many years ago, similar difficulties were already solved in radio communication; As a result each channel is immune to interference from other radio channels. Amplitude Modulated (AM) video camera  separates the influence of a modulated light from other unknown light sources in the scene; Causing the AM video camera frame to appear the same - independent of the light  conditions in which it was taken. We built a prototype of the AM video camera by using off the shelf hardware and tested it. AM video camera was used to demonstrate color constancy, shadow removal and contrast enhancement in real time. We show theoretically and empirically that: 1. the proposed system can produce images with similar noise levels as a standard camera. 2. The images created by such camera are almost completely immune to temporal, spatial and spectral changes in the background light.",

        "abstract": "Manifold-valued datasets are widely encountered in many computer vision tasks. A non-linear analog of the PCA algorithm, called the Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA) algorithm suited for data lying on Riemannian manifolds was reported in literature a decade ago. Since the objective function in the PGA algorithm is highly non-linear and hard to solve efficiently in general, researchers have proposed a linear approximation. Though this linear approximation is easy to compute, it lacks accuracy especially when the data exhibits a large variance. Recently, an alternative called the exact PGA was proposed which tries to solve the optimization without any linearization. For general Riemannian manifolds, though it yields a better accuracy than the original (linearized) PGA, for data that exhibit large variance, the optimization is not computationally efficient. In this paper, we propose an efficient exact PGA algorithm for constant curvature Riemannian manifolds (CCM-EPGA). The CCM-EPGA algorithm differs significantly from existing PGA algorithms in two aspects, (i) the distance between a given manifold-valued data point and the principal submanifold is computed analytically and thus no optimization is required as in the existing methods. (ii) Unlike the existing PGA algorithms, the descent into codimension-1 submanifolds does not require any optimization but is accomplished through the use of the Rimeannian inverse Exponential map and the parallel transport operations. We present theoretical and experimental results for constant curvature Riemannian manifolds depicting favorable performance of the CCM-EPGA algorithm compared to existing PGA algorithms. We also present data reconstruction from the principal components which has not been reported in literature in this setting.",

        "abstract": "Egocentric cameras are being worn by an increasing number of users, among them many security forces worldwide. GoPro cameras already penetrated the mass market, reporting substantial increase in sales every year. As head-worn cameras do not capture the photographer, it may seem that the anonymity of the photographer is preserved even when the video is publicly distributed.   We show that camera motion, as can be computed from the egocentric video, provides unique identity information. The photographer can be reliably recognized from a few seconds of video captured when walking. The proposed method achieves more than 90% recognition accuracy in cases where the random success rate is only 3%.  Applications can include theft prevention by locking the camera when not worn by its lawful owner. Searching video sharing services (e.g. YouTube) for egocentric videos shot by a specific photographer may also become possible. An important message in this paper is that photographers should be aware that sharing egocentric video will compromise their anonymity, even when their face is not visible.",

We isolate factors by adopting a common convolutional architecture either deployed globally on the image to compute class posterior distributions, or restricted locally to compute class conditional distributions given location, scale and aspect ratios of bounding boxes determined by proposal heuristics. In theory, averaging the latter should yield inferior performance compared to proper marginalization. Yet empirical evidence suggests the converse, leading us to conclude that - at the current level of complexity of convolutional architectures and scale of the data sets used to train them - CNNs are not very effective at marginalizing nuisance variability. We also quantify the effects of context on the overall classification task and its impact on the performance of CNNs, and propose improved sampling techniques for heuristic proposal schemes that improve end-to-end performance to state-of-the-art levels. We test our hypothesis on a classification task using the ImageNet Challenge benchmark and on a wide-baseline matching task using the Oxford and Fischer's datasets.",

However, both are generally considered `black box' predictors as the non-linear transformations involved have so far prevented transparent and interpretable reasoning. Recently, a principled technique, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), has been developed in order to better comprehend the inherent structured reasoning of complex nonlinear classification models such as Bag of Feature models or DNNs. In this paper we (1) extend the LRP framework also for Fisher vector classifiers and then use it as analysis tool to (2) quantify the importance of context for classification, (3) qualitatively compare DNNs against FV classifiers in terms of important image regions and (4) detect potential flaws and biases in data.  All experiments are performed on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and ILSVRC 2012 data sets.",

We believe that a promising resource for efficiently learning this knowledge is through readily available unlabeled video. We present a framework that capitalizes on temporal structure in unlabeled video to learn to anticipate human actions and objects. The key idea behind our approach is that we can train deep networks to predict the visual representation of images in the future. Visual representations are a promising prediction target because they encode images at a higher semantic level than pixels yet are automatic to compute. We then apply recognition algorithms on our predicted representation to anticipate objects and actions. We experimentally validate this idea on two datasets, anticipating actions one second in the future and objects five seconds in the future.",

        "abstract": "We propose a method for visual question answering which combines an internal representation of the content of an image with information extracted from a general knowledge base to answer a broad range of image-based questions. This allows more complex questions to be answered using the predominant neural network-based approach than has previously been possible.  It particularly allows questions to be asked about the contents of an image, even when the image itself does not contain the whole answer. The method constructs a textual representation of the semantic content of an image, and merges it with textual information sourced from a knowledge base, to develop a deeper understanding of the scene viewed. Priming a recurrent neural network with this combined information, and the submitted question, leads to a very flexible visual question answering approach. We are specifically able to answer questions posed in natural language, that refer to information not contained in the image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on two publicly available datasets, Toronto COCO-QA and VQA, and show that it produces the best reported results in both cases.",

        "abstract": "Incorporating multi-scale features in fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) has been a key element to achieving state-of-the-art performance on semantic image segmentation. One common way to extract multi-scale features is to feed multiple resized input images to a shared deep network and then merge the resulting features for pixel-wise classification. In this work, we propose an attention mechanism that learns to softly weight the multi-scale features at each pixel location. We adapt a state-of-the-art semantic image segmentation model, which we jointly train with multi-scale input images and the attention model. The proposed attention model not only outperforms average- and max-pooling, but allows us to diagnostically visualize the importance of features at different positions and scales. Moreover, we show that adding extra supervision to the output at each scale is essential to achieving excellent performance when merging multi-scale features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model with extensive experiments on three challenging datasets, including PASCAL-Person-Part, PASCAL VOC 2012 and a subset of MS-COCO 2014.",

Our framework is the first one to provide simultaneously comprehensive facial motion tracking and a detailed 3D model of the user's head. Anyone's head can be instantly reconstructed and his facial motion captured without requiring any training or pre-scanning. The user starts facing the camera with a neutral expression in the first frame, but is free to move, talk and change his face expression as he wills otherwise. The facial motion is tracked using a blendshape representation while the fine geometric details are captured using a Bump image mapped over the template mesh. We propose an efficient algorithm to grow and refine the 3D model of the head on-the-fly and in real-time. We demonstrate robust and high-fidelity simultaneous facial motion tracking and 3D head modeling results on a wide range of subjects with various head poses and facial expressions. Our proposed method offers interesting possibilities for animation production and 3D video telecommunications.",

Unlike previous approaches that usually assume either static scenes or cameras, our method is capable of handling both dynamic scenes and moving cameras. Under a bottom-up framework, it first clusters pixels into coherent groups using color and motion features. These pixel groups are then analyzed in a fully connected graph, and labeled as either fence or non-fence using graph-cut optimization. Finally, we solve a dense Conditional Random Filed (CRF) constructed from multiple frames to enhance both spatial accuracy and temporal coherence of the segmentation. Once segmented, one can use existing hole-filling methods to generate a fence-free output. Extensive evaluation suggests that our method outperforms previous automatic and interactive approaches on complex examples captured by mobile devices.",

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality yet largely preventable, but the key to prevention is to identify at risk individuals before adverse events. For predicting individual CVD risk, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), a noninvasive ultrasound method, has proven to be valuable, offering several advantages over CT coronary artery calcium score. However, each CIMT examination includes several ultrasound videos, and interpreting each of these CIMT videos involves three operations: (1) select three end-diastolic ultrasound frames (EUF) in the video, (2) localize a region of interest (ROI) in each selected frame, and (3) trace the lumen-intima interface and the media-adventitia interface in each ROI to measure CIMT. These operations are tedious, laborious, and time consuming, a serious limitation that hinders the widespread utilization of CIMT in clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a new system to automate CIMT video interpretation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the suggested system significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The superior performance is attributable to our unified framework based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) coupled with our informative image representation and effective post-processing of the CNN outputs, which are uniquely designed for each of the above three operations.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an algorithm coined BORDER (Bounding Oriented-Rectangle Descriptors for Enclosed Regions) for texture-less object recognition. By fusing a regional object encompassment concept with descriptor-based pipelines, we extend local-patches into scalable object-sized oriented rectangles for optimal object information encapsulation with minimal outliers. We correspondingly introduce a modified line-segment detection technique termed Linelets to stabilize keypoint repeatability in homogenous conditions. In addition, a unique sampling technique facilitates the incorporation of robust angle primitives to produce discriminative rotation-invariant descriptors. BORDER's high competence in object recognition particularly excels in homogenous conditions obtaining superior detection rates in the presence of high-clutter, occlusion and scale-rotation changes when compared with modern state-of-the-art texture-less object detectors such as BOLD and LINE2D on public texture-less object databases.",

They are usually trained in a supervised setting involving annotations of objects. We propose a weakly supervised top-down saliency framework using only binary labels that indicate the presence/absence of an object in an image. First, the probabilistic contribution of each image patch to the confidence of an ScSPM-based classifier produces a Reverse-ScSPM (R-ScSPM) saliency map. Neighborhood information is then incorporated through a contextual saliency map which is estimated using logistic regression learnt on patches having high R-ScSPM saliency. Both the saliency maps are combined to obtain the final saliency map. We evaluate the performance of the proposed weakly supervised top-down saliency and achieves comparable performance with fully supervised approaches. Experiments are carried out on 5 challenging datasets across 3 different applications.",

In addition, we enrich state-of-the-art F-formation modelling by learning a frustum of attention that accounts for the spatial context. That is, F-formation configurations vary with respect to the arrangement of furniture and the non-uniform crowdedness in the space during mingling scenarios. The majority of prior works have considered the labelling of conversing group as an objective task, requiring only a single annotator. However, we show that by embracing the subjectivity of social involvement, we not only generate a richer model of the social interactions in a scene but also significantly improve F-formation detection. We carry out extensive experimental validation of our proposed approach by collecting a novel set of multi-annotator labels of involvement on the publicly available Idiap Poster Data;  the only multi-annotator labelled database of free standing conversing groups that is currently available.",

These, however, may not be valid always, in particular for fast and irregularly moving objects. Here, we present an object tracker that is not limited to a local search window and has ability to probe efficiently the entire frame. Our method generates a small number of \"high-quality\" proposals by a novel instance-specific objectness measure and evaluates them against the object model that can be adopted from an existing tracking-by-detection approach as a core tracker. During the tracking process, we update the object model concentrating on hard false-positives supplied by the proposals, which help suppressing distractors caused by difficult background clutters, and learn how to re-rank proposals according to the object model. Since we reduce significantly the number of hypotheses the core tracker evaluates, we can use richer object descriptors and stronger detector.  Our method outperforms most recent state-of-the-art trackers on popular tracking benchmarks, and provides improved robustness for fast moving objects as well as for ultra low-frame-rate videos.",

Using a bilateral formulation, the energy that we minimize implicitly approximates long-range, spatio-temporal connections between pixels while still containing only a small number of variables and only local graph edges. We compare to a number of recent methods, and show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks in a fraction of the runtime.

Our work is inspired by the interesting observation that the dark channel of blurred images is less sparse. While most image patches in the clean image contain some dark pixels, these pixels are not dark when averaged with neighboring high-intensity pixels during the blur process.Our analysis shows that this change in the sparsity of the dark channel is an inherent property of the blur process, both theoretically and empirically. This change in the sparsity of the dark channel is an inherent property of the blur process, which we both prove mathematically and validate using training data. Therefore, enforcing the sparsity of the dark channel helps blind deblurring on various scenarios, including natural, face, text, and low-illumination images. However, sparsity of the dark channel introduces a non-convex non-linear optimization problem. We introduce a linear approximation of the min operator to compute the dark channel. Our look-up-table-based method converges fast in practice and can be directly extended to non-uniform deblurring. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on deblurring natural images and compares favorably methods that are well-engineered for specific scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Blind image deconvolution is an ill-posed inverse problem which is often addressed through the application of appropriate prior. Although some priors are informative in general, many images do not strictly conform to this, leading to degraded performance in the kernel estimation. More critically, real images may be contaminated by nonuniform noise such as saturation and outliers.Methods for removing specific image areas based on some priors have been proposed, but they operate either manually or by defining fixed criteria. We show here that a subset of the image gradients are adequate to estimate the blur kernel robustly, no matter the gradient image is sparse or not. We thus introduce a gradient activation method to automatically select a subset of gradients of the latent image in a cutting-plane-based optimization scheme for kernel estimation. No extra assumption is used in our model, which greatly improves the accuracy and flexibility. More importantly, the proposed method affords great convenience for handling noise and outliers. Experiments on both synthetic data and real-world images demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.",

Intuitively, however, categories that are more similar should share more information than those that are very different. While hierarchical deep networks address this problem by learning separate features for subsets of related categories, current implementations require simplified models using fixed architectures specified via heuristic clustering methods. Instead, we propose Blockout, a method for regularization and model selection that simultaneously learns both the model architecture and parameters. A generalization of Dropout, our approach gives a novel parametrization of hierarchical architectures that allows for structure learning via back-propagation. To demonstrate its utility, we evaluate Blockout on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets, demonstrating improved classification accuracy, better regularization performance, faster training, and the clear emergence of hierarchical network structures.",

        "abstract": "Convolutional neural nets (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in recent history. Such approaches tend to work in a \"unidirectional\" bottom-up feed-forward fashion. However, practical experience and biological evidence tells us that feedback plays a crucial role, particularly for detailed spatial understanding tasks. This work explores \"bidirectional\" architectures that also reason with top-down feedback: neural units are influenced by both lower and higher-level units.  We do so by treating units as rectified latent variables in a quadratic energy function, which can be seen as a hierarchical Rectified Gaussian model (RGs). We show that RGs can be optimized with a quadratic program (QP), that can in turn be optimized with a recurrent neural network (with rectified linear units). This allows RGs to be trained with GPU-optimized gradient descent. From a theoretical perspective, RGs help establish a connection between CNNs and hierarchical probabilistic models. From a practical perspective, RGs are well suited for detailed spatial tasks that can benefit from top-down reasoning. We illustrate them on the challenging task of keypoint localization under occlusions, where local bottom-up evidence may be misleading. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks.",

Our contribution is showing that extracting additional data from the video stream - besides the vehicle image itself - and feeding it into the deep convolutional neural network boosts the recognition performance considerably.  This additional information includes: 3D vehicle bounding box used for \"unpacking\" the vehicle image, its rasterized low-resolution shape, and information about the 3D vehicle orientation. Experiments show that adding such information decreases classification error by 26% (the accuracy is improved from 0.772 to 0.832) and boosts verification average precision by 208% (0.378 to 0.785) compared to baseline pure CNN without any input modifications. Also, the pure baseline CNN outperforms the recent state of the art solution by 0.081. We provide an annotated set \"BoxCars\" of surveillance vehicle images augmented by various automatically extracted auxiliary information.  Our approach and the dataset can considerably improve the performance of traffic surveillance systems.",

        "abstract": "While deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown a great success in single-label image classification, it is important to note that most real world images contain multiple labels, which could correspond to different objects, scenes, actions and attributes in an image. Traditional approaches to multi-label image classification learn independent classifiers for each category and employ ranking or thresholding on the classification results. These techniques, although working well, fail to explicitly exploit the label dependencies in an image. In this paper, we utilize recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to address this problem. Combined with CNNs, the proposed CNN-RNN framework learns a joint image-label embedding to characterize the semantic label dependency as well as the image-label relevance, and it can be trained end-to-end from scratch to integrate both information in an unified framework. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art multi-label classification models.",

In contrast to previous works which were limited to low dimensional features and small datasets, the proposed method scales to large datasets with high dimensional face descriptors. It utilises pairwise (dis-)similarity constraints as supervision and hence does not require exhaustive class annotation for every training image. While, traditionally, multi-task learning methods have been validated on same dataset but different tasks, we work on the more chal- lenging setting with heterogeneous datasets and different tasks. We show empirical validation on multiple face im- age datasets of different facial traits, e.g. identity, age and expression. We use classic Local Binary Pattern (LBP) de- scriptors along with the recent Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features. The experiments clearly demon- strate the scalability and improved performance of the pro- posed method on the tasks of identity and age based face image retrieval compared to competitive existing methods, on the standard datasets and with the presence of a million distractor face images.",

They decompose the object detection problem into two cascaded easier tasks: 1) generating object proposals from images, 2) classifying proposals into various object categories. Despite that we are handling with two relatively easier tasks, they are not solved perfectly and there's still room for improvement. In this paper, we push the \"divide and conquer\" solution even further by dividing each task into two sub-tasks. We call the proposed method \"CRAFT\" (Cascade Region-proposal-network And FasT-rcnn), which tackles each task with a carefully designed network cascade. We show that the cascade structure helps in both tasks: in proposal generation, it provides more compact and better localized object proposals; in object classification, it reduces false positives (mainly between ambiguous categories) by capturing both inter- and intra-category variances. CRAFT achieves consistent and considerable improvement over the state-of-the-art on object detection benchmarks like PASCAL VOC 07/12 and ILSVRC.",

In these cases, it has been proposed to use information from dynamic objects in the scene for suggesting point and line correspondences.  We propose a speed up of about two orders of magnitude, as well as an increase in robustness and accuracy, to methods computing epipolar geometry from dynamic silhouettes based on a new temporal signature, motion barcode for lines. This is a binary temporal sequence for lines, indicating for each frame the existence of at least one foreground pixel on that line. The motion barcodes of two corresponding epipolar lines are very similar so the search for corresponding epipolar lines can be limited to lines having similar barcodes leading to increased speed, accuracy, and robustness in computing the epipolar geometry.",

        "abstract": "Camera calibration directly from image sequences of a pedestrian without using any calibration object is a really challenging task and should be well solved in computer vision, especially in visual surveillance. In this paper, we propose a novel camera calibration method based on recovering the three orthogonal vanishing points (TOVPs), just using an image sequence of a pedestrian walking in a straight line, without any assumption of scenes or motions, e.g., control points with known 3D coordinates, parallel or perpendicular lines, non-natural or pre-designed special human motions, as often necessary in previous methods. The traces of shoes of a pedestrian carry more rich and easily detectable metric information than all other body parts in the periodic motion of a pedestrian, but such information is usually overlooked by previous work. In this paper, we employ the images of the toes of the shoes on the ground plane to determine the vanishing point corresponding to the walking direction, and then utilize harmonic conjugate properties in projective geometry to recover the vanishing point corresponding to the perpendicular direction of the walking direction in the horizontal plane and the vanishing point corresponding to the vertical direction. After recovering all of the TOVPs, the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera can be determined. Experiments on various scenes and viewing angles prove the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method.",

As closely related edge pixels construct the structural information of an object, we observe that cohesive characters compose a meaningful word/sentence sharing similar properties such as spatial location, size, color, and stroke width regardless of language. However, prevalent scene text detection approaches have not fully utilized such similarity, but mostly rely on the characters classified with high confidence, leading to low recall rate. By exploiting the similarity, our approach can quickly and robustly localize a variety of texts. Inspired by the original Canny edge detector, our algorithm makes use of double threshold and hysteresis tracking to detect texts of low confidence. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art scene text detection methods in terms of detection rate.",

        "abstract": "Knowing how hands move and what object is being manipulated are two key sub-tasks for analyzing first-person (egocentric) action. However, lack of fully annotated hand data as well as imprecise foreground segmentation make either sub-task challenging. This work aims to explicitly address these two issues via introducing a cascaded interactional targeting (i.e., infer both hand and active object regions) deep neural network. Firstly, a novel EM-like learning framework is proposed to train the pixel-level deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) by seamlessly integrating weakly supervised data (i.e., massive bounding box annotations) with a small set of strongly supervised data (i.e., fully annotated hand segmentation maps) to achieve state-of-the-art hand segmentation performance. Secondly, the resulting high-quality hand segmentation maps are further paired with the corresponding motion maps and object feature maps, in order to explore the contextual information among object, motion and hand to generate interactional foreground regions (operated objects). The resulting interactional target maps (hand + active object) from our cascaded DCNN are further utilized to form discriminative action representation. Experiments show that our framework has achieved the state-of-the-art egocentric action recognition performance on the benchmark dataset Activities of Daily Living (ADL).",

Online map services like Google Maps or Here Maps provide direct access to huge amounts of densely sampled, georeferenced images from street view and aerial perspective. There is an opportunity to design computer vision systems that will help us search, catalog and monitor public infrastructure, buildings and artifacts. We explore the architecture and feasibility of such a system. The main technical challenge is combining test time information from multiple views of each geographic location (e.g., aerial and street views). We implement two modules: det2geo, which detects the set of loca- tions of objects belonging to a given category, and geo2cat, which computes the fine-grained category of the object at a given location. We introduce a solution that adapts state-of-the-art CNN-based object detectors and classifiers. We test our method on \"Pasadena Urban Trees\", a new dataset of 80,000 trees with geographic and species annotations, and show that combining multiple views significantly improves both tree detection and tree species classification, rivaling human performance.",

        "abstract": "Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects so that objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. The crucial step in most clustering algorithms is to find an appropriate similarity metric, which is both challenging and problem-dependent. Supervised clustering approaches, which can exploit labeled clustered training data that share a common metric with the test set, have thus been proposed. Unfortunately, current metric learning approaches for supervised clustering do not scale to large or even medium-sized datasets. In this paper, we propose a new structured Mahalanobis Distance Metric Learning method for supervised clustering. We formulate our problem as an instance of large margin structured prediction and prove that it can be solved very efficiently in closed-form. The complexity of our method is (in most cases) linear in the size of the training dataset. We further reveal a striking similarity between our approach and multivariate linear regression. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets confirm several orders of magnitude speedup while still achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

However, this information does not remain the same at object boundaries when there is object motion against a significantly varying background.  In this paper, we propose a new approach for feature detection, tracking and re-detection that gives significantly improved results at the object boundaries.  We utilize level lines or iso-intensity curves that often remain stable and can be reliably detected even at the object boundaries, which they often trace. Stable portions of long level lines are detected and points of high curvature  are detected on such curves for corner detection.  Further, this level line is used to separate the portions belonging to the two objects, which is then used for robust matching of such points.  While such CoMaL (Corners on Maximally-stable Level Line Segments) points were found to be much more reliable at the object boundary regions, they perform comparably at the interior regions as well. This is illustrated in exhaustive experiments on real-world datasets.",

        "abstract": "Interactive video segmentation systems aim at producing sub-pixel-level object boundaries for visual effect applications. Recent approaches mainly focus on using sparse user input (i.e. scribbles) for efficient segmentation; however, the quality of the final object boundaries is not satisfactory for the following reasons: (1) the boundary on each frame is often not accurate; (2) boundaries across adjacent frames wiggle around inconsistently, causing temporal flickering; and (3) there is a lack of direct user control for fine tuning.  We propose Coherent Parametric Contours, a novel video segmentation propagation framework that addresses all the above issues. Our approach directly models the object boundary using a set of parametric curves,  providing direct user controls for manual adjustment. A spatio-temporal optimization algorithm is employed to produce object boundaries that are spatially accurate and temporally stable. We show that existing evaluation datasets are limited and demonstrate a new set to cover the common cases in professional rotoscoping. A new metric for evaluating temporal consistency is proposed. Results show that our approach generates higher quality, more coherent segmentation results than previous methods.",

This  paper presents a compact coding solution for efficient search, with a  focus on the quantization approach which has already shown the superior  performance over the hashing solutions in the single-modal similarity  search. We propose a cross modal quantization approach, which is among  the early attempts to introduce quantization into cross-modal search.  The major contribution lies in jointly learning the quantizers for both  modalities through aligning the quantized representations for each  pair of image and text belonging to a document. In addition, our  approach simultaneously learns the common space for both modalities in  which quantization is conducted to enable efficient and effective search  using the Euclidean distance computed in the common space with fast  distance table lookup. Experimental results compared with several  competitive algorithms over three benchmark datasets demonstrate that  the proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance.",

The generative MRF acts on higher-levels of a dCNN feature pyramid, controling the image layout at an abstract level. We apply the method to both photographic and non-photo-realistic (artwork) synthesis tasks. The MRF regularizer prevents over-excitation artifacts and reduces implausible feature mixtures common to previous dCNN inversion approaches, permitting synthezing photographic content with increased visual plausibility. Unlike standard MRF-based texture synthesis, the combined system can both match and adapt local features with considerable variability, yielding results far out of reach of classic generative MRF methods.",

However, bilinear features are high dimensional, typically on the order of hundreds of thousands to a few million, which makes them impractical for subsequent analysis. We propose two compact bilinear representations with the same discriminative power as the full bilinear representation but with only a few thousand dimensions. Our compact representations allow back-propagation of classification errors enabling an end-to-end optimization of the visual recognition system. The compact bilinear representations are derived through a novel kernelized analysis of bilinear pooling which provide insights into the discriminative power of bilinear pooling, and a platform for further research in compact pooling methods.

        "abstract": "In many image-related tasks, learning expressive and discriminative representations of images is essential, and deep learning has been studied for automating the learning of such representations. Some user-centric tasks, such as image recommendations, call for effective representations of not only images but also preferences and intents of users over images. Such representations are termed hybrid and addressed via a deep learning approach in this paper. We design a dual-net deep network, in which the two sub-networks map input images and preferences of users into a same latent semantic space, and then the distances between images and users in the latent space are calculated to make decisions. We further propose a comparative deep learning (CDL) method to train the deep network, using a pair of images compared against one user to learn the pattern of their relative distances. The CDL embraces much more training data than naive deep learning, and thus achieves superior performance than the latter, with no cost of increasing network complexity. Experimental results with real-world data sets for image recommendations have shown the proposed dual-net network and CDL greatly outperform other state-of-the-art image recommendation solutions.",

        "abstract": "Photo aesthetics assessment is challenging. Deep convolutional neural network (ConvNet) methods have recently shown promising results for aesthetics assessment. The performance of these deep ConvNet methods, however, is often compromised by the constraint that the neural network only takes the fixed-size input. To accommodate this requirement, input images need to be transformed via cropping, scaling, or padding, which often damages image composition, reduces image resolution, or causes image distortion, thus compromising the aesthetics of the original images. In this paper, we present a composition-preserving deep ConvNet method that directly learns aesthetics features from the original input images without any image transformations. Specifically, our method adds an adaptive spatial pooling layer upon the regular convolution and pooling layers to directly handle input images with original sizes and aspect ratios. To allow for multi-scale feature extraction, we develop the Multi-Net Adaptive Spatial Pooling ConvNet architecture which consists of multiple sub-networks with different adaptive spatial pooling sizes and leverage a scene-based aggregation layer to effectively combine the predictions from multiple sub-networks. Our experiments on the large-scale aesthetics assessment benchmark (AVA) demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the state-of-the-art results in photo aesthetics assessment.",

The challenges in reconstructing images from fine angular resolution VLBI data are immense. The data is extremely sparse and noisy, thus requiring statistical image models such as those designed in the computer vision community. In this paper we present a novel Bayesian approach for VLBI image reconstruction. While other methods often require careful tuning and parameter selection for different types of data, our method (CHIRP) produces good results under different settings such as low SNR or extended emission. The success of our method is demonstrated on realistic synthetic experiments as well as publicly available real data. We present this problem in a way that is accessible to members of the community, and provide a dataset website (vlbiimaging.csail.mit.edu) that facilitates controlled comparisons across algorithms.",

By utilizing label correlations, various techniques have been developed to improve classification performance. However, current existing methods either neglect image features when exploiting label correlations or lack the ability to learn image-dependent conditional label structures. In this paper, we develop conditional graphical Lasso (CGL) to handle these challenges. CGL provides a unified Bayesian framework for structure and parameter learning conditioned on image features. We formulate the multi-label prediction as CGL inference problem, which is solved by a mean field variational approach. Meanwhile, CGL learning is efficient due to a tailored proximal gradient procedure by applying the maximum a posterior (MAP) methodology. CGL performs competitively for multi-label image classification on benchmark datasets MULAN scene, PASCAL VOC 2007 and PASCAL VOC 2012, compared with the state-of-the-art multi-label classification algorithms.",

A major focus of computational conformal geometry is the estimation of the conformal mapping that aligns a given pair of object surfaces. The uniformization theorem en- ables this task to be acccomplished in a canonical 2D do- main, wherein the surfaces can be aligned using a M obius transformation. Current algorithms for estimating M obius transformations, however, often cannot provide satisfactory alignment or are computationally too costly. This paper in- troduces a novel globally optimal algorithm for estimating Mobius transformations to align surfaces that are topologi- cal discs. Unlike previous methods, the proposed algorithm deterministically calculates the best transformation, with- out requiring good initializations. Further, our algorithm is also much faster than previous techniques in practice. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm on data commonly used in computational conformal geometry.",

        "abstract": "Recently, there have been many progresses for the problem of non-rigid structure reconstruction based on 2D trajectories, but it is still challenging to deal with complex deformations or restricted view ranges. Promising alternatives are the piecewise reconstruction approaches, which divide trajectories into several local parts and stitch their individual reconstructions to produce an entire 3D structure. These methods show the state-of-the-art performance, however, most of them are specialized for relatively smooth surfaces and some are quite complicated. Meanwhile, it has been reported numerously in the field of pattern recognition that obtaining consensus from many weak hypotheses can give a strong, powerful result. Inspired by these reports, in this paper, we push the concept of part-based reconstruction to the limit: Instead of considering the parts as explicitly-divided local patches, we draw a large number of small random trajectory sets. From their individual reconstructions, we pull out a statistic of each 3D point to retrieve a strong reconstruction, of which the procedure can be expressed as a sparse l_1-norm minimization problem. In order to resolve the reflection ambiguity between weak (and possibly bad) reconstructions, we propose a novel optimization framework which only involves a single eigenvalue decomposition. The proposed method can be applied to any type of data and outperforms the existing methods for the benchmark sequences, even though it is composed of a few, simple steps. Furthermore, it is easily parallelizable, which is another advantage.",

However, not all silhouettes can actually be projections of the same object in space: this simple observation has implications in object recognition and multi-view segmentation, and has been (often implicitly) used as a basis for camera calibration. In this paper, we investigate the conditions for multiple silhouettes, or more generally arbitrary closed image sets, to be geometrically \"consistent\". We present this notion as a natural generalization of traditional multi-view geometry, which deals with consistency for points. After discussing some general results, we present a \"dual\" formulation for consistency, that gives conditions for a family of planar sets to be sections of the same object. Finally, we introduce a more general notion of silhouette \"compatibility\" under partial knowledge of the camera projections, and point out some possible directions for future research.",

        "abstract": "Feature learning with deep models has achieved impressive results for both data representation and classification for various vision tasks. Deep feature learning, however,typically requires a large amount of training data, which may not be feasible for some application domains. Transfer learning can be one of the approaches to alleviate this problem by transferring data from data-rich source domain to data-scarce target domain. Existing transfer learning methods typically perform one-shot transfer learning and often ignore the specific properties that the transferred data must satisfy. To address these issues, we introduce a constrained deep transfer feature learning method to perform simultaneous transfer learning and feature learning by performing transfer learning in a progressively improving feature space iteratively in order to better narrow the gap between the target domain and the source domain for effective transfer of the data from source domain to target domain. Furthermore, we propose to exploit the target domain knowledge and incorporate such prior knowledge as constraint during transfer learning to ensure that the transferred data satisfies certain properties of the target domain.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed constrained deep transfer feature learning method, we apply it to thermal feature learning for eye detection by transferring from the visible domain.

        "abstract": "Cascade regression framework has been shown to be effective for facial landmark detection. It starts from an initial face shape and gradually predicts the face shape update from the local appearance features to generate the facial landmark locations in the next iteration until convergence. In this paper, we improve upon the cascade regression framework and propose the Constrained Joint Cascade Regression Framework (CJCRF) for simultaneous facial action unit recognition and facial landmark detection, which are two related face analysis tasks, but are seldomly exploited together. In particular, we first learn the relationships among facial action units and face shapes as a constraint. Then, in the proposed constrained joint cascade regression framework, with the help from the constraint, we iteratively update the facial landmark locations and the action unit activation probabilities until convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that the intertwined relationships of facial action units and face shapes boost the performances of both facial action unit recognition and facial landmark detection. The experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method comparing to the state-of-the-art works.",

Thus, evaluating poor views wastes much time, and a poor view may even be misidentified as a best one. In this paper, we propose a search strategy by identifying the regions that are very likely to contain best views, referred to as canonical regions. It is by decomposing the model under investigation into meaningful parts, and using the canonical views of these parts to generate canonical regions. Applying existing view selection methods in the canonical regions can not only accelerate the search process but also guarantee the quality of obtained views. As a result, when our canonical regions are used for searching N-best views during comprehensive model analysis, we can attain greater search speed and reduce the number of views required. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.",

By analogy with auto-encoders, we propose Context Encoders -- a convolutional neural network trained to generate the contents of an arbitrary image region conditioned on its surroundings. In order to succeed at this task, context encoders need to both understand the content of the entire image, as well as produce a plausible hypothesis for the missing part(s). When training context encoders, we have experimented with both a standard pixel-wise reconstruction loss, as well as a reconstruction plus an adversarial loss.  The latter produces much sharper results because it can better handle multiple modes in the output. We found that a context encoder learns a representation that captures not just appearance but also the semantics of visual structures. We quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned features for CNN pre-training on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Furthermore, context encoders can be used for semantic inpainting tasks, either stand-alone or as initialization for non-parametric methods.",

Although widely used, existing PSR methods cannot align point sets robustly under degradations, such as deformation, noise, occlusion, outlier, rotation, and multi-view changes. This paper proposes context-aware Gaussian fields (CA-LapGF) for non-rigid PSR subject to global rigid and local non-rigid geometric constraints, where a laplacian regularized term is added to preserve the intrinsic geometry of the transformed set. CA-LapGF uses a robust objective function and the quasi-Newton algorithm to estimate the likely correspondences, and the non-rigid transformation parameters between two point sets iteratively. The CA-LapGF can estimate non-rigid transformations, which are mapped to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, accurately and robustly in the presence of degradations. Experimental results on synthetic and real images reveal that how CA-LapGF outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for non-rigid PSR.",

Contours are important intermediate features for structuring point clouds and converting them into high-quality surface or solid models, and are extensively used in graphics and mapping applications. Yet, detecting them in unstructured, inhomogeneous point clouds turns out to be surprisingly difficult, and existing line detection algorithms largely fail. We approach contour extraction as a two-stage discriminative learning problem. In the first stage, a contour score for each individual point is predicted with a binary classifier, using a set of features extracted from the point's neighborhood. The contour scores serve as a basis to construct an overcomplete graph of candidate contours. The second stage selects an optimal set of contours from the candidates. This amounts to a further binary classification in a higher-order MRF, whose cliques encode a preference for connected contours and penalize loose ends. The method can handle point clouds >10^7 points in a couple of minutes, and vastly outperforms a baseline that performs Canny-style edge detection on a range image representation of the point cloud.",

Specifically, we extend the Minimum Cost Multicut Problem by a class of constraints that enforce convexity. To solve instances of this NP-hard integer linear program to optimality, we separate the proposed constraints in the branch-and-cut loop of a state-of-the-art ILP solver.

In this paper we utilize CNNs to predict depth information for given Light Field (LF) data. The proposed method learns an end-to-end mapping between the 4D light field and a representation of the corresponding 4D depth field in terms of 2D hyperplane orientations. The obtained prediction is then further refined in a post processing step by applying a higher-order regularization. Existing LF datasets are not sufficient for the purpose of the training scheme tackled in this paper. This is mainly due to the fact that the ground truth depth of existing datasets is inaccurate and/or the datasets are limited to a small number of LFs. This made it necessary to generate a new synthetic LF dataset, which is based on the raytracing software POV-Ray. This new dataset provides floating point accurate ground truth depth fields, and due to a random scene generator the dataset can be scaled as required.",

In this work we show a systematic design for how convolutional networks can be incorporated into the pose machine framework for learning image features and image-dependent spatial models for the task of pose estimation. The contribution of this paper is to implicitly model long-range dependencies between variables in structured prediction tasks such as articulated pose estimation. We achieve this by designing a sequential architecture composed of convolutional networks that directly operate on belief maps from previous stages, producing increasingly refined estimates for part locations, without the need for explicit graphical model-style inference. Our approach addresses the characteristic difficulty of vanishing gradients during training by providing a natural learning objective function that enforces intermediate supervision, thereby replenishing back-propagated gradients and conditioning the learning procedure. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and outperform competing methods on standard benchmarks including the MPII, LSP, and FLIC datasets.",

We make the following findings: (i) that rather than fusing at the softmax layer, a spatial and temporal network can be fused at a convolution layer without loss of performance, but with a substantial saving in parameters; (ii) that it is better to fuse such networks spatially at the last convolutional layer than earlier, and that additionally fusing at the class prediction layer can boost accuracy; finally (iii) that pooling of abstract convolutional features over spatiotemporal neighbourhoods further boosts performance. Based on these studies we propose a new ConvNet architecture for spatiotemporal fusion of video snippets, and evaluate its performance on standard benchmarks where this architecture achieves state-of-the-art results.",

        "abstract": "While great progress has been made in stereo computation over the last decades, large textureless regions remain challenging. Segment-based methods can tackle this problem properly, but their performances are sensitive to the segmentation results. In this paper, we alleviate the sensitivity by generating multiple proposals on absolute and relative disparities from multi-segmentations. These proposals supply rich descriptions of surface structures. Especially, the relative disparity between distant pixels can encode the large structure, which is critical to handle the large texture-less regions. The proposals are coordinated by point-wise competition and pairwise collaboration within a MRF model. During inference, a dynamic programming is performed in different directions with various step sizes, so the long-range connections are better preserved. In the experiments, we carefully analyzed the effectiveness of the major components. Results on the 2014 Middlebury and KITTI 2015 stereo benchmark show that our method is comparable to state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "Joint modeling of the intensity of facial action units (AUs) from face images is challenging due to the large number of AUs (30+) and their intensity levels (6). This is  in part due to the lack of suitable models that can efficiently handle such a large number of outputs/classes simultaneously, but also due to the lack of target data. For this reason, majority of the methods proposed resort to independent classifiers for the AU intensity. This is suboptimal for at least two reasons: the facial appearance of some AUs changes depending on the intensity of other AUs, and some AUs co-occur more often than others. Encoding this is expected to improve the estimation of target AU intensities, especially in the case of noisy image features, head-pose variations and imbalanced training data. To this end, we introduce a novel modeling framework, Copula Ordinal Regression (COR), that leverages the power of copula functions and CRFs, to detangle the probabilistic modeling of AU dependencies from the marginal modeling of the AU intensity. Consequently, the COR model achieves the joint learning and inference of intensities of multiple AUs, while being computationally tractable. We show on two challenging datasets of naturalistic facial expressions that the proposed approach consistently outperforms (i) independent modeling of AU intensities, and (ii) the state-of-the-art approach for the target task.",

        "abstract": "There is a great deal of interest in using large scale brain imaging studies to understand how brain connectivity evolves over time for an individual and how it varies over different levels/quantiles of cognitive function. To do so, one typically performs so-called tractography procedures on diffusion MR brain images and derives measures of brain connectivity expressed as graphs. The nodes correspond to distinct brain regions and the edges encode the strength of the connection. The scientific interest is in characterizing the evolution of these graphs over time or from healthy individuals to diseased. We pose this important question in terms of the Laplacian of the connectivity graphs derived from various longitudinal or disease time points - quantifying its progression is then expressed in terms of coupling the harmonic bases of a full set of Laplacians. We derive a coupled system of generalized eigenvalue problems (and corresponding numerical optimization schemes) whose solution helps characterize the full life cycle of brain connectivity evolution in a given dataset. Finally, we show a set of results on a diffusion MR imaging dataset of middle aged people at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), who are cognitively healthy. In such asymptomatic adults, we find that a framework for characterizing brain connectivity evolution provides the ability to predict cognitive scores for individual subjects, and for estimating the progression of participant's brain connectivity into the future.",

This success can be largely attributed to learning shared representations from multiple supervisory tasks. However, existing multi-task approaches rely on enumerating multiple network architectures specific to the tasks at hand, that do not generalize. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to learn shared representations in ConvNets using multi-task learning. Specifically, we propose a new sharing unit: \"cross-stitch\" unit. These units combine the activations from multiple networks and can be trained end-to-end. A network with cross-stitch units can learn an optimal combination of shared and task-specific representations. Our proposed method generalizes across multiple tasks and shows dramatically improved performance over baseline methods for categories with few training examples.",

We further design the One-Step Sparse Inference (1-SI) module, as an efficient and light-weighted feed-forward approximation of sparse coding. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of the proposed D3 model over several state-of-the-art methods.

In this paper, we introduce recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to address this issue. Specifically, directed acyclic graph RNNs (DAG-RNNs) are proposed to process DAG-structured images, which enables the network to model long-range semantic dependencies among image units. Our DAG-RNNs are capable of tremendously enhancing the discriminative power of local representations, which significantly benefits the local classification. Meanwhile, we propose a novel class weighting function that attends to rare classes, which phenomenally boosts the recognition accuracy for non-frequent classes. Integrating with convolution and deconvolution layers, our DAG-RNNs achieve new state-of-the-art results on the challenging SiftFlow, CamVid and Barcelona benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "The morphology of glands has been used routinely by pathologists to assess the malignancy degree of adenocarcinomas. Accurate segmentation of glands from histology images is a crucial step to obtain reliable morphological statistics for quantitative diagnosis. In this paper, we proposed an efficient deep contour-aware network (DCAN) to solve this challenging problem under a unified multi-task learning framework. In the proposed network, multi-level contextual features from the hierarchical architecture are explored with auxiliary supervision for accurate gland segmentation. When incorporated with multi-task regularization during the training, the discriminative capability of intermediate features can be further improved. Moreover, our network can not only output accurate probability maps of glands, but also depict clear contours simultaneously for separating clustered objects, which further boosts the gland segmentation performance. This unified framework can be efficient when applied to large-scale histopathological data without resorting to additional steps to generate contours based on low-level cues for post-separating. Our method won the 2015 MICCAI Gland Segmentation Challenge out of 13 competitive teams, surpassing all the other methods by a significant margin.",

        "abstract": "Traditional1 salient object detection models often use hand-crafted features to formulate contrast and various prior knowledge, and then combine them artificially. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end deep hierarchical saliency network (DHSNet) based on convolutional neural networks for detecting salient objects. DHSNet first makes a coarse global prediction by automatically learning various global structured saliency cues, including global contrast, objectness, compactness, and their optimal combination. Then a novel hierarchical recurrent convolutional neural network (HRCNN) is adopted to further hierarchically and progressively refine the details of saliency maps step by step via integrating local context information. The whole architecture works in a global to local and coarse to fine manner. DHSNet is directly trained using whole images and corresponding ground truth saliency masks. When testing, saliency maps can be generated by directly and efficiently feedforwarding testing images through the network, without relying on any other techniques. Evaluations on four benchmark datasets and comparisons with other 11 state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate that DHSNet not only shows its significant superiority in terms of performance, but also achieves a real-time speed of 23 FPS on modern GPUs.",

Existing solutions to this problem often rely strongly on hand-engineered features and vanishing point detection, which are prone to failure in the presence of clutter. In this paper, we present a method that uses a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) in conjunction with a novel optimization framework for generating layout estimates. We demonstrate that our method is robust in the presence of clutter and handles a wide range of highly challenging scenes. We evaluate our method on two standard benchmarks and show that it achieves state of the art results, outperforming previous methods by a wide margin.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms for the analysis of time-series often depend on the assumption that the utilised data are temporally aligned. Any temporal discrepancies arising in the data is certain to lead to ill-generalisable models, which in turn fail to correctly capture the properties of the task at hand. The temporal alignment of time-series is thus a crucial challenge manifesting in a multitude of applications. Nevertheless, the vast majority of algorithms oriented towards the temporal alignment of time-series are applied directly on the observation space, or utilise simple linear projections.  Thus, they fail to capture complex, hierarchical non-linear representations which may prove to be beneficial towards the task of temporal alignment, particularly when dealing with multi-modal data (e.g., aligning visual and acoustic information). To this end, we present the Deep Canonical Time Warping (DCTW), a method which automatically learns complex non-linear representations of multiple time-series, generated such that (i) they are highly correlated, and (ii) temporally in alignment. By means of experiments on four real datasets, we show that the representations learnt via the proposed DCTW significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in temporal alignment, elegantly handling scenarios with highly heterogeneous features, such as the temporal alignment of acoustic and visual features.",

        "abstract": "While recent deep neural network models have achieved promising results on the image captioning task, they rely largely on the availability of corpora with paired image and sentence captions to describe objects in context. In this work, we propose the Deep Compositional Captioner (DCC) to address the task of generating descriptions of novel objects which are not present in paired image-sentence datasets.  Our method achieves this by leveraging large object recognition datasets and external text corpora and by transferring knowledge between semantically similar concepts.  Current deep caption models can only describe objects contained in paired image-sentence corpora, despite the fact that they are pre-trained with large object recognition datasets, namely ImageNet.  In contrast, our model can compose sentences that describe novel objects and their interactions with other objects. We demonstrate our model's ability to describe novel concepts by empirically evaluating its performance on MSCOCO and show qualitative results on ImageNet images of objects for which no paired image-caption data exist. Further, we extend our approach to generate descriptions of objects in video clips. Our results show that DCC has distinct advantages over existing image and video captioning approaches for generating descriptions of new objects in context.",

        "abstract": "Salient object detection has recently witnessed substantial progress due to powerful features extracted using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, existing CNN-based methods operate at the patch level instead of the pixel level. Resulting saliency maps are typically blurry, especially near the boundary of salient objects. Furthermore, image patches are treated as independent samples even when they are overlapping, giving rise to significant redundancy in computation and storage. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep contrast network to overcome the aforementioned limitations. Our deep network consists of two complementary components, a pixel-level fully convolutional stream and a segment-wise spatial pooling stream. The first stream directly produces a saliency map with pixel-level accuracy from an input image. The second stream extracts segment-wise features very efficiently, and better models saliency discontinuities along object boundaries. Finally, a fully connected CRF model can be optionally incorporated to improve spatial coherence and contour localization in the fused result from these two streams. Experimental results demonstrate that our deep model significantly improves the state of the art.",

This results in a tree-like structured network driven by the data. The proposed method provides an insight into the data by identifying the group of classes that are hard to classify and require more attention when compared to others. DDN also has the ability to make early decisions thus making it suitable for time-sensitive applications.

        "abstract": "We propose a novel end-to-end trainable deep network architecture for image denoising based on a Gaussian Conditional Random Field (GCRF) model. In contrast to the existing discriminative denoising methods that train a separate model for each individual noise level, the proposed deep network explicitly models the input noise variance and hence is capable of handling a range of noise levels. Our deep network, which we refer to as deep GCRF network, consists of two sub-networks: (i) a parameter generation network that generates the pairwise potential parameters based on the noisy input image, and  ii) an inference network whose layers perform the computations involved in an iterative GCRF inference procedure. We train two deep GCRF networks (each network operates over a range of noise levels: one for low input noise levels and one for high input noise  levels) discriminatively by maximizing the peak signal-to-noise ratio measure. Experiments on Berkeley segmentation and PASCALVOC datasets show that the proposed approach produces results on par with the state-of-the-art without training a separate network for each individual noise level.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a new approach to learning a frame-based classifier on weakly labelled sequence data by embedding a CNN within an iterative EM algorithm. This allows the CNN to be trained on a vast number of example images when only loose sequence level information is available for the source videos. Although we demonstrate this in the context of hand shape recognition, the approach has wider application to any video recognition task where frame level labelling is not available. The iterative EM algorithm leverages the discriminative ability of the CNN to iteratively refine the frame level annotation and subsequent training of the CNN. By embedding the classifier within an EM framework the CNN can easily be trained on 1 million hand images. We demonstrate that the final classifier generalises over both individuals and data sets. The algorithm is evaluated on over 3000 manually labelled hand shape images of 60 different classes which will be released to the community. Furthermore, we demonstrate its use in continuous sign language recognition on two publicly available large sign language data sets, where it outperforms the current state-of-the-art by a large margin. To our knowledge no previous work has explored expectation maximization without Gaussian mixture models to exploit weak sequence labels for sign language recognition.",

Previous algorithms require substantial user interactions to estimate the foreground and background distributions. In this paper, we present a novel deep-learning-based algorithm which has much better understanding of objectness and can reduce user interactions to just a few clicks. Our algorithm transforms user-provided positive and negative clicks into two Euclidean distance maps which are then concatenated with the RBG channels of images to compose (image, user interactions) pairs. We generate many of such pairs by combining several random sampling strategies to model users' click patterns and use them to finetune deep Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs). Finally the output probability maps of our FCN-8s model is integrated with graph cut optimization to refine the boundary segments. Our model is trained on the PASCAL segmentation dataset and evaluated on other datasets with different object classes. Experimental results on both seen and unseen objects clearly demonstrate that our algorithm has a good generalization ability and is superior to all existing interactive object selection approaches.",

        "abstract": "Learning the distance metric between pairs of examples is of great importance for learning and visual recognition. With the remarkable success from the state of the art convolutional neural networks, recent works have shown promising results on discriminatively training the networks to learn semantic feature embeddings where similar examples are mapped close to each other and dissimilar examples are mapped farther apart. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for taking full advantage of the training batches in the neural network training by lifting the vector of pairwise distances within the batch to the matrix of pairwise distances. This step enables the algorithm to learn the state of the art feature embedding by optimizing a novel structured prediction objective for active hard negative mining on the lifted problem. Additionally, we collected Online Products dataset: 120k images of 23k classes of online products for metric learning. Our experiments on the CUB-200-2011, CARS196, and Online Products datasets demonstrate significant improvement over existing deep feature embedding methods on all experimented embedding sizes with the GoogLeNet network.

        "abstract": "Undoing the image formation process and therefore decomposing appearance into its intrinsic properties is a challenging task due to the under-constraint nature of this inverse problem. While significant progress has been made on inferring shape, materials and illumination from images only, progress in unconstrained setting is still limited. We propose a fully convolutional neural architecture to estimate reflectance maps of specular materials in natural lighting conditions. We achieve this in an end-to-end learning formulation that directly predicts a reflectance map from the image itself. We show how to improve estimates by facilitating additional supervision in an indirect scheme that first predicts surface orientation and afterwards predicts the reflectance map by a learning-based sparse data interpolation. In order to analyze performance on this difficult task, we propose a new challenge of Specular MAterials on SHapes with complex IllumiNation (SMASHINg) using both synthetic and real images. Furthermore, we show the application our method to a range of image-based editing tasks on real images.",

        "abstract": "Region learning (RL) and multi-label learning (ML) have recently attracted increasing attentions in the field of facial Action Unit (AU) detection. Knowing that AUs are active on sparse facial regions, RL aims to identify these regions for a better specificity. On the other hand, a strong statistical evidence of AU correlations suggests that ML is a natural way to model the detection task. In this paper, we propose Deep Region and Multi-label Learning (DRML), a unified deep network that simultaneously addresses these two problems. One crucial aspect in DRML is a novel region layer that uses feed-forward functions to induce important facial regions, forcing the learned weights to capture structural information of the face. Our region layer serves as an alternative design between locally connected layers (i.e., confined kernels to individual pixels) and conventional convolution layers (i.e., shared kernels across an entire image). Unlike previous studies that solve RL and ML alternately, DRML by construction addresses both problems, allowing the two seemingly irrelevant problems to interact more directly. The complete network is end-to-end trainable, and automatically learns representations robust to variations inherent within a local region. Experiments on BP4D and DISFA benchmarks show that DRML performs the highest average F1-score and AUC within and across datasets in comparison with alternative methods.",

However, compared with person re-identification or face recognition, vehicle search problem has long been neglected by researchers in vision community. This paper focuses on an interesting but challenging problem, vehicle re-identification (a.k.a precise vehicle search). We propose a Deep Relative Distance Learning (DRDL) method which exploits a two-branch deep convolutional network to project raw vehicle images into an Euclidean space where distance can be directly used to measure the similarity of arbitrary two vehicles. To further facilitate the future research on this problem, we also present a carefully-organized large-scale image database \"VehicleID\", which includes multiple images of the same vehicle captured by different real-world cameras in a city. We evaluate our DRDL method on our VehicleID dataset and another recently-released vehicle model classification dataset \"CompCars\" in three sets of experiments: vehicle re-identification, vehicle model verification and vehicle retrieval. Experimental results show that our method can achieve promising results and outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.",

We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers.  The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in saliency detection have utilized deep learning to obtain high level features to detect salient regions in a scene. They have demonstrated superior results over previous works that utilize hand-crafted low level features for saliency detection. In this paper, we demonstrate that the hand-crafted features can provide complementary effects to enhance performance of saliency detection that utilizes only high level features. Our method utilizes both high level and low level features for saliency detection under a unified deep learning framework. The high level features are extracted using the VGG-net, and the low level features are compared with other parts of an image to form a low level distance map. The low level distance map is then encoded using a CNN with multiple 1*1 convolutional and ReLU layers. We concatenate the encoded low level distance map and the high level features, and connect them to a fully connected neural network classifier to evaluate the saliency of a query region. Our experiments show that our method can further improve performance of the state-of-the-art deep learning based saliency detection methods.",

        "abstract": "We present a deep layered architecture that generalizes convolutional neural networks (ConvNets).  The architecture, called SimNets, is driven by two operators: (i) a similarity function that generalizes inner-product, and (ii) a log-mean-exp function called MEX that generalizes maximum and average.  The two operators applied in succession give rise to a standard neuron but in \"feature space\".  The feature spaces realized by SimNets depend on the choice of the similarity operator.  The simplest setting, which corresponds to a convolution, realizes the feature space of the Exponential kernel, while other settings realize feature spaces of more powerful kernels (Generalized Gaussian, which includes as special cases RBF and Laplacian), or even dynamically learned feature spaces (Generalized Multiple Kernel Learning).  As a result, the SimNet contains a higher abstraction level compared to a traditional ConvNet.  We argue that enhanced expressiveness is important when the networks are small due to run-time constraints (such as those imposed by mobile applications).  Empirical evaluation validates the superior expressiveness of SimNets, showing a significant gain in accuracy over ConvNets when computational resources at run-time are limited.  We also show that in large-scale settings, where computational complexity is less of a concern, the additional capacity of SimNets can be controlled with proper regularization, yielding accuracies comparable to state of the art ConvNets.",

In our approach, we propose the first 3D Region Proposal Network (RPN) to learn objectness from geometric shapes and the first joint Object Recognition Network (ORN) to extract geometric features in 3D and color features in 2D. In particular, we handle objects of various sizes by training an amodal RPN at two different scales and an ORN to regress 3D bounding boxes.

We propose a deep architecture consisting of two networks: i) a convolutional neural network (CNN) extracting the image representation for pixelwise object labeling and ii) a recursive neural network (RNN) discovering the hierarchical object structure and the inter-object relations. Rather than relying on elaborative annotations (e.g., manually labeled semantic maps and relations), we train our deep model in a weakly-supervised manner by leveraging the descriptive sentences of the training images. Specifically, we decompose each sentence into a semantic tree consisting of nouns and verb phrases, and facilitate these trees discovering the configurations of the training images. Once these scene configurations are determined, then the parameters of both the CNN and RNN are updated accordingly by back propagation. The entire model training is accomplished through an Expectation-Maximization method. Extensive experiments suggest that our model is capable of producing meaningful and structured scene configurations and achieving more favorable scene labeling performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 over other state-of-the-art weakly-supervised methods.",

While the complex image appearance variations still pose a great challenge to reliable retrieval, in light of the recent progress of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in learning robust image representation on various vision tasks, this paper proposes a novel Deep Supervised Hashing (DSH) method to learn compact similarity-preserving binary code for the huge body of image data. Specifically, we devise a CNN architecture that takes pairs of images (similar/dissimilar) as training inputs and encourages the output of each image to approximate discrete values (e.g. +1/-1). To this end, a loss function is elaborately designed to maximize the discriminability of the output space by encoding the supervised information from the input image pairs, and simultaneously imposing regularization on the real-valued outputs to approximate the desired discrete values. For image retrieval, new-coming query images can be easily encoded by propagating through the network and then quantizing the network outputs to binary codes representation. Extensive experiments on two large scale datasets CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE show the promising performance of our method compared with the state-of-the-arts.",

Indeed, often rather small and inconspicuous objects and features  have to be detected to tell their classes apart. In order to deal with this challenge, we propose a  novel convolutional neural network that mines mid-level image patches that are sufficiently  dedicated to resolve the corresponding subtleties. In particular, we train a newly designed CNN (DeepPattern) that learns discriminative patch groups. There are two innovative aspects to this. On  the one hand we pay attention to contextual information in an original fashion. On the other hand,  we let an iteration of feature learning and patch clustering purify the set of dedicated patches that we use. We validate  our method for action classification on two challenging datasets: PASCAL VOC 2012 Action and Stanford  40 Actions, and for attribute recognition we use the Berkeley Attributes of People dataset. Our  discriminative mid-level mining CNN obtains state-of-the-art results on these datasets, without a  need for annotations about parts and poses.",

We propose an approach that jointly solves the tasks of detection and pose estimation: it infers the number of persons in a scene, identifies occluded body parts, and disambiguates body parts between people in close proximity of each other. This joint formulation is in contrast to previous strategies, that address the problem by first detecting people and subsequently estimating their body pose. We propose a partitioning and labeling formulation of a set of body-part hypotheses generated with CNN-based part detectors. Our formulation, an instance of an integer linear program, implicitly performs non-maximum suppression on the set of part candidates and groups them to form configurations of body parts respecting geometric and appearance constraints. Experiments on four different datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results for both single person and multi person pose estimation.",

Such rich annotations enable the development of powerful algorithms in clothes recognition and facilitating future researches. To demonstrate the advantages of DeepFashion, we propose a new deep model, namely FashionNet, which learns clothing features by jointly predicting clothing attributes and landmarks. The estimated landmarks are then employed to pool or gate the learned features. It is optimized in an iterative manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FashionNet and the usefulness of DeepFashion.",

        "abstract": "State-of-the-art deep neural networks have achieved impressive results on many image classification tasks. However, these same architectures have been shown to be unstable to small, well sought, perturbations of the images. Despite the importance of this phenomenon, no effective methods have been proposed to accurately compute the robustness of state-of-the-art deep classifiers to such perturbations on large-scale datasets. In this paper, we fill this gap and propose the DeepFool algorithm to efficiently compute perturbations that fool deep networks, and thus reliably quantify the robustness of these classifiers. Extensive experimental results show that our approach outperforms recent methods in the task of computing adversarial perturbations and making classifiers more robust.",

We discriminatively train convolutional neural networks to output a low dimensional activation feature given a depth map. This activation feature vector is representative of the global or local joint angle parameters of a hand pose. We efficiently identify 'spatial' nearest neighbors to the activation feature, from a database of features corresponding to synthetic depth maps, and store some 'temporal' neighbors from previous frames. Our matrix completion algorithm uses these 'spatio-temporal' activation features and the corresponding known pose parameter values to to estimate the unknown pose parameters of the input feature vector. Our database of activation features supplements large viewpoint coverage and our hierarchical estimation of pose parameters is robust to occlusions. We show that our approach  compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods while achieving real time performance (32 FPS) on a standard computer.",

        "abstract": "Deep networks have recently enjoyed enormous success when applied to recognition and classification problems in computer vision [22, 32], but their use in graphics problems has been limited ([23, 7] are notable recent exceptions). In this work, we present a novel deep architecture that per- forms new view synthesis directly from pixels, trained from a large number of posed image sets. In contrast to tradi- tional approaches which consist of multiple complex stages of processing, each of which require careful tuning and can fail in unexpected ways, our system is trained end-to-end. The pixels from neighboring views of a scene are presented to the network which then directly produces the pixels of the unseen view. The benefits of our approach include gen- erality (we only require posed image sets and can easily apply our method to different domains), and high quality results on traditionally difficult scenes. We believe this is due to the end-to-end nature of our system which is able to plausibly generate pixels according to color, depth, and tex- ture priors learnt automatically from the training data. We show view interpolation results on imagery from the KITTI dataset [12], from data from [1] as well as on StreetView images. To our knowledge, our work is the first to apply deep learning to the problem of new view synthesis from sets of real-world, natural imagery.",

Our method requires only partial geometric information in the form of two depth maps or partial reconstructed surfaces, works for humans in arbitrary poses and wearing any clothing, does not require the two people to be scanned from similar viewpoints, and runs in real time. We use a deep convolutional neural network to train a feature descriptor on depth map pixels, but crucially, rather than training the network to solve the shape correspondence problem directly, we train it to solve a body region classification problem, modified to increase the smoothness of the learned descriptors near region boundaries. This approach ensures that nearby points on the human body are nearby in feature space, and vice versa, rendering the feature descriptor suitable for computing dense correspondences between the scans. We validate our method on real and synthetic data for both clothed and unclothed humans, and show that our correspondences are more robust than is possible with state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, and more accurate to those found using methods that require full watertight 3D geometry.",

We then show that the scene can be reconstructed based on these motion models by optimizing a convex program. The optimization jointly reasons about the scales of different objects and assembles the scene in a common coordinate frame, determined up to a global scale. Experimental results demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms prior methods for monocular depth estimation in dynamic scenes.",

To address the localization and description task jointly we propose a Fully Convolutional Localization Network (FCLN) architecture that processes an image with a single, efficient forward pass, requires no external regions proposals, and can be trained end-to-end with a single round of optimization. The architecture is composed of a Convolutional Network, a novel dense localization layer, and Recurrent Neural Network language model that generates the label sequences. We evaluate our network on the Visual Genome dataset, which comprises 94,000 images and 4,100,000 region-grounded captions. We observe both speed and accuracy improvements over baselines based on current state of the art approaches in both generation and retrieval settings.",

The auxiliary cameras are well calibrated and act as a passive depth sensor by generating disparity maps. The main camera has an interchangeable lens and can produce good quality images at high resolution. Our goal is, given the low-res depth map from the auxiliary cameras, generate a depth map from the viewpoint of the main camera. The advantage of our system, compared to other systems such as light-field cameras or RGBD sensors, is the ability to generate a high-resolution color image with a complete depth map, without sacrificing resolution and with minimal auxiliary hardware.  Since the main camera has an interchangeable lens, it cannot be calibrated beforehand, and directly applying stereo matching on it and either of the auxiliary cameras often leads to unsatisfactory results. Utilizing both the calibrated cameras at once, we propose a novel approach to better estimate the disparity map of the main camera. Then by combining the defocus cue of the main camera, the disparity map can be further improved. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on various scenes.",

        "abstract": "Multi-person event recognition is a challenging task, often with many people active in the scene but only a small subset contributing to an actual event. In this paper, we propose a model which learns to detect events in such videos while automatically \"attending\" to the people responsible for the event.  Our model does not use explicit annotations regarding who or where those people are during training and testing. In particular, we track people in videos and use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to represent the track features.  We learn time-varying attention weights to combine these features at each time-instant. The attended features are then processed using another RNN for event detection/classification.  Since most video datasets with multiple people are restricted to a small number of videos, we also collected a new basketball dataset comprising 257 basketball games with 14K event annotations corresponding to 11 event classes.  Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both event classification  and  detection on this new dataset. Additionally, we show that the attention mechanism is able to consistently localize the relevant players.",

        "abstract": "Bird migration is a critical indicator of environmental health, biodiversity, and climate change. Existing techniques for monitoring bird migration are either expensive (e.g., satellite tracking), labor-intensive (e.g., moon watching), indirect and thus less accurate (e.g., weather radar), or intrusive (e.g., attaching geolocators on captured birds). In this paper, we present a vision-based system for detecting migrating birds in flight at night. Our system takes stereo videos of the night sky as inputs, detects multiple flying birds and estimates their orientations, speeds, and altitudes. The main challenge lies in detecting flying birds of unknown trajectories under high noise level due to the low-light environment. We address this problem by incorporating stereo constraints for rejecting physically implausible configurations and gathering evidence from two (or more) views. Specifically, we develop a robust stereo-based 3D line fitting algorithm for geometric verification and a deformable part response accumulation strategy for trajectory verification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through quantitative evaluation of  real videos of birds migrating at night collected with near-infrared cameras.",

While the method relies on a fairly sophisticated deformable part model, unlike existing techniques it estimates the model parameters in an unsupervised fashion thus alleviating the need for a user-annotated training data and avoiding the associated specificity. This automatic fitting process is carried out by exploiting the recurrence of small image patches associated with the repeating object and analyzing their spatial correlation. The analysis allows us to reject outlier patches, recover the visual and shape parameters of the part model, and detect the object instances efficiently.  In order to achieve a practical system which is able to cope with diverse images, we describe a simple and intuitive active-learning procedure that updates the object classification by querying the user on very few carefully chosen marginal classifications. Evaluation of the new method against the state-of-the-art techniques demonstrates its ability to achieve higher accuracy through a better user experience.",

The dominant trend in existing methods is to first find candidate vanishing points, then remove outliers by enforcing mutual orthogonality. Our method reverses this process: we propose a set of horizon line candidates and score each based on the vanishing points it contains. A key element of our approach is the use of global image context, extracted with a deep convolutional network, to constrain the set of candidates under consideration. Our method does not make a Manhattan-world assumption and can operate effectively on scenes with only a single horizontal vanishing point.  We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance on each. In addition, our approach is significantly faster than the previous best method.",

Fiducials are used in a wide range of applications, especially when a reliable visual reference is needed, e.g., to track the camera in cluttered or textureless environments. A marker designed for such applications must be robust to partial occlusions, varying distances and angles of view, and fast camera motions. In this paper, we present a robust, highly accurate fiducial system, whose markers consist of concentric rings, along with its theoretical foundations. Relying on projective properties, it allows to robustly localize the imaged marker and to accurately detect the position of the image of the (common) circle center. We demonstrate that our system can detect and accurately localize these circular fiducials under very challenging conditions and the experimental results reveal that it outperforms other recent fiducial systems.",

        "abstract": "The problem of localizing occlusions between consecutive frames of a video is important but rarely tackled on its own. In most works, it is tightly interleaved with the computation of accurate optical flows, which leads to a delicate chicken-and-egg problem. With this in mind, we propose a novel approach to occlusion detection where visibility or not of a point in next frame is formulated in terms of visual reconstruction. The key issue is now to determine how well a pixel in the first image can be \"recon- structed\" from co-located colors in the next image. We first exploit this reasoning at the pixel level with a new detection criterion. Contrary to the ubiquitous displaced-frame-difference and forward-backward flow vector matching, the proposed alternative does not critically depend on a precomputed, dense displacement field, while being shown to be more effective. We then leverage this local modeling within an energy-minimization framework that delivers occlusion maps. An easy-to-obtain collection of parametric motion models is exploited within the energy to provide the required level of motion information. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods on the challenging MPI Sintel dataset.",

        "abstract": "Feature representation and object category classification are two key components of most object detection methods. While significant improvements have been achieved for deep feature representation learning, traditional SVM/softmax classifiers remain the dominant methods for final object category classification. However, SVM/softmax classifiers lack the capacity of explicitly exploiting the complex structure of deep features, as they are purely discriminative methods. The recently proposed discriminative dictionary pair learning (DPL) model involves a fidelity term to minimize the reconstruction loss and a discrimination term to enhance the discriminative capability of the learned dictionary pair, and thus is appropriate for balancing the representation and discrimination to boost object detection performance. In this paper, we propose a novel object detection system by unifying DPL with the convolutional feature learning. Specifically, we incorporate DPL as a Dictionary Pair Classifier Layer (DPCL) into the deep architecture, and develop an end-to-end learning algorithm for optimizing the dictionary pairs and the neural networks simultaneously. Moreover, we design a multi-task loss for guiding our model to accomplish the three correlated tasks: objectness estimation, categoryness computation, and bounding box regression. From the extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007/2012 benchmarks, our approach demonstrates the effectiveness to substantially improve the performances over the popular existing object detection frameworks (e.g., R-CNN [13] and FRCN [12]), and achieves new state-of-the-arts.",

By contrast, we directly regress from a spatio-temporal volume of bounding boxes to a 3D pose in the central frame.   We further show that, for this approach to  achieve its full potential, it is essential to compensate for the motion in consecutive frames so that the subject remains centered. This then allows us to effectively overcome  ambiguities and improve upon the state-of-the-art by a large margin on the Human3.6m, HumanEva, and KTH Multiview Football 3D human pose  estimation benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "We propose a motion-based method to discover the physical parts of an articulated object class (e.g. head/torso/leg of a horse) from multiple videos. The key is to find object regions that exhibit consistent motion relative to the rest of the object, across multiple videos. We can then learn a location model for the parts and segment them accurately in the individual videos using an energy function that also enforces temporal and spatial consistency in part motion. Unlike our approach, traditional methods for motion segmentation or non-rigid structure from motion operate on one video at a time. Hence they cannot discover a part unless it displays independent motion in that particular video. We evaluate our method on a new dataset of 32 videos of tigers and horses, where we significantly outperform a recent motion segmentation method on the task of part discovery (obtaining roughly twice the accuracy).",

In practice, the approach works well to handle non-unitary transformations as well. Our theoretical results extend the reach of a recent theory of invariance to discriminative and kernelized features based on unitary kernels. As a special case, a single common framework can be used to generate subject-specific pose-invariant features for face recognition and vice-versa for pose estimation. We show that our main proposed method (DIKF) can perform well under very challenging large-scale semi-synthetic face matching and pose estimation protocols with unaligned faces using no land-marking whatsoever. We additionally benchmark on CMU MPIE and outperform previous work in almost all cases on off-angle face matching while we are on par with the previous state-of-the-art on the LFW unsupervised and image-restricted protocols, without any low-level image descriptors other than raw-pixels.",

        "abstract": "RGBD scene recognition has attracted increasingly attention due to the rapid development of depth sensors and their wide application scenarios. While many research has been conducted, most work used hand-crafted features which are difficult to capture high-level semantic structures. Recently, the feature extracted from deep convolutional neural network has produced state-of-the-art results for various computer vision tasks, which inspire researchers to explore incorporating CNN learned features for RGBD scene understanding. On the other hand, most existing work combines rgb and depth features without adequately exploiting the consistency and complementary information between them. Inspired by some recent work on RGBD object recognition using multi-modal feature fusion, we introduce a novel discriminative multi-modal fusion framework for rgbd scene recognition for the first time which simultaneously considers the inter- and intra-modality correlation for all samples and meanwhile regularizing the learned features to be discriminative and compact. The results from the multimodal layer can be back-propagated to the lower CNN layers, hence the parameters of the CNN layers and multimodal layers are updated iteratively until convergence. Experiments on the recently proposed large scale SUN RGB-D datasets show that our method achieved the state-of-the-art without any image segmentation.",

Efficiently clustering such data is a challenge. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel multi-view clustering method called Discriminatively Embedded K-Means (DEKM), which embeds the synchronous learning of multiple discriminative subspaces into multi-view K-Means clustering to construct a unified framework, and adaptively control the intercoordinations between these subspaces simultaneously. In this framework, we firstly design a weighted multi-view Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and then develop an unsupervised optimization scheme to alternatively learn the common clustering indicator, multiple discriminative subspaces and weights for heterogeneous features with convergence. Comprehensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets and comparisons with several state-of-the-art multi-view clustering algorithms demonstrate the superiority of the proposed work.",

Although it seems weird to intentionally generate incorrect training labels, we show that DisturbLabel prevents the network training from over-fitting by implicitly averaging over exponentially many networks which are trained with different label sets. To the best of our knowledge, DisturbLabel serves as the first work which adds noises on the loss layer.

Could this performance gap be due to systematic differences between object representations in humans and machines? To answer this question we collected a large dataset of 26,675 perceived dissimilarity measurements from 2,801 visual objects across 269 human subjects, and used this dataset to train and test leading computational models. The best model (a combination of all models) accounted for 68% of the explainable variance. Importantly, all computational models showed systematic deviations from perception: (1) They underestimated perceptual distances between objects with symmetry or large area differences; (2) They overestimated perceptual distances between objects with shared features. Our results reveal critical elements missing in computer vision algorithms and point to explicit encoding of these properties in higher visual areas in the brain.",

Digital cameras, on the other hand, are significantly cheaper in comparison and can be easily purchased and used. In this paper, we present a framework for reconstructing hyperspectral images by using multiple consumer-level digital cameras. Our approach works by exploiting the different spectral sensitivities of different camera sensors. In particular, due to the differences in spectral sensitivities of the cameras, different cameras yield different RGB measurements for the same spectral signal. We  introduce an algorithm that is able to combine and convert these different RGB measurements into a single hyperspectral image for both indoor and outdoor scenes. This camera-based approach allows hyperspectral imaging at a fraction of the cost of most existing hyperspectral hardware. We validate the accuracy of our reconstruction against ground truth hyperspectral images (using both synthetic and real cases) and show its usage on relighting applications.",

The dynamic image is based on the rank pooling concept and is obtained through the parameters of a ranking machine that encodes the temporal evolution of the frames of the video. Dynamic images are obtained by directly applying rank pooling on the raw image pixels of a video producing a single RGB image per video. This idea is simple but powerful as it enables the use of existing CNN models directly on video data with fine-tuning. We present an efficient and effective approximate rank pooling operator, speeding it up orders of magnitude compared to rank pooling. Our new approximate rank pooling CNN layer allows us to generalize dynamic images to dynamic feature maps and we demonstrate the power of our new representations on standard benchmarks in action recognition achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

        "abstract": "We propose a method to recover the shape of a 3D room from a full-view indoor panorama. Our algorithm can automatically infer a 3D shape from a collection of partially oriented superpixel facets and line segments. The core part of the algorithm is a constraint graph, which includes lines and superpixels as vertices, and encodes their geometric relations as edges. A novel approach is proposed to perform 3D reconstruction based on the constraint graph by solving all the geometric constraints as constrained linear least-squares. The selected constraints used for reconstruction are identified using an occlusion detection method with a Markov random field. Experiments show that our method can recover room shapes that can not be addressed by previous approaches. Our method is also efficient, that is, the inference time for each panorama is less than 1 minute.",

        "abstract": "As a key component in many computer vision systems, optical flow estimation, especially with large displacements, remains an open problem. In this paper we present a simple but powerful matching method works in a coarse-to-fine scheme for optical flow estimation. Inspired by the nearest neighbor field (NNF) algorithms, our approach, called CPM (Coarse-to-fine PatchMatch), blends an efficient random search strategy with the coarse-to-fine scheme for optical flow problem. Unlike existing NNF techniques, which is efficient but the results is often too noisy for optical flow caused by the lack of global regularization, we propose a propagation step with constrained random search radius between adjacent levels on the hierarchical architecture. The resulting correspondences enjoys a built-in smoothing effect, which is more suited for optical flow estimation than NNF techniques. Furthermore, our approach can also capture the tiny structures with large motions which is a problem for traditional coarse-to-fine optical flow algorithms. Interpolated by an edge-preserving interpolation method (EpicFlow), our method outperforms the state of the art on MPI-Sintel and KITTI, and runs much faster than the competing methods.",

However, current architectures rely on siamese networks which exploit concatenation followed by further processing layers, requiring a minute of GPU computation per image pair. In contrast, in this paper we propose a matching network which is able to produce very accurate results in less than a second of GPU computation. Towards this goal, we exploit a product layer which simply computes the inner product between the two representations of a siamese architecture. We train our network by treating the problem as multi-class classification, where the classes are all possible disparities. This allows us to get calibrated scores, which result in much better matching performance when compared to existing approaches.",

SIFT-like descriptors, however, are quickly being replaced with descriptors based on deep neural networks (DNN) that provide better performance for many computer vision tasks.     In this paper, we introduce a new dataset of one billion descriptors based on DNNs and reveal the relative inefficiency of IMI-based indexing for such descriptors compared to SIFT data. We then introduce two new indexing structures, the Non-Orthogonal Inverted Multi-Index (NO-IMI) and the Generalized Non-Orthogonal Inverted Multi-Index (GNO-IMI). We show that due to additional flexibility, the new structures are  able to adapt to DNN descriptor distribution in a better way. In particular, extensive experiments on the new dataset demonstrate that these data structures provide considerably better trade-off between the speed of retrieval and recall, given similar amount of memory, as compared to the standard Inverted Multi-Index.",

Our goal is to reduce the number of vector operations and memory for performing a search without sacrificing accuracy of the returned images. We adopt a group testing formulation and design the decoding architecture using either dictionary learning or eigendecomposition. The latter is a plausible option for small-to-medium sized problems with high-dimensional global image descriptors, whereas dictionary learning is applicable in large-scale scenarios. We evaluate our approach for global descriptors obtained from both SIFT and CNN features. Experiments with standard image search benchmarks, including the Yahoo100M dataset comprising 100 million images, show that our method gives comparable (and sometimes superior) accuracy compared to exhaustive search while requiring only 10% of the vector operations and memory. Moreover, for the same search complexity, our method gives significantly better accuracy compared to approaches based on dimensionality reduction or locality sensitive hashing.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in semantic image segmentation have mostly been achieved by training deep convolutional neural networks(CNNs). We show how to improve semantic segmentation through the use of contextual information; specifically, we explore 'patch-patch' context between image regions, and 'patch-background' context. For learning from the patch-patch context, we formulate Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) with CNN-based pairwise potential functions to capture semantic correlations between neighboring patches. Efficient piecewise training of the proposed deep structured model is then applied to avoid repeated expensive CRF inference for back propagation. For capturing the patch-background context, we show that a network design with traditional multi-scale image input and sliding pyramid pooling is effective for improving performance. Our experimental results set new state-of-the-art performance on a number of popular semantic segmentation datasets, including NYUDv2, PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL-Context, and SIFT-flow. In particular, we achieve an intersection-over-union score of 78.0 on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.",

        "abstract": "We tackle the problem of large-scale object detection in images, where the number of objects can be arbitrarily large, and can exhibit significant overlap/occlusion.  A successful approach to modelling the large-scale nature of this problem has been via point process density functions which jointly encode object qualities and spatial interactions.  But the corresponding optimisation problem is typically difficult or intractable, and many of the best current methods rely on Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulation, which converges slowly in a large solution space.   We propose an efficient point process inference for large-scale object detection using discrete energy minimization. In particular, we approximate the solution space by a finite set of object proposals and cast the point process density function to a corresponding energy function of binary variables whose values indicate which object proposals are accepted. We resort to the local submodular approximation (LSA) based trust-region optimisation to find the optimal solution. Furthermore we analyse the error of LSA approximation, and show how to adjust the point process energy to dramatically speed up the convergence without harms in the optimality. We demonstrate the superior efficiency and accuracy of our method using a variety of large-scale object detection applications such as crowd human detection, birds, cells counting/localization.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a new framework to compare and classify temporal sequences. The proposed approach captures the underlying dynamics of the data while avoiding expensive estimation procedures, making it suitable to process large numbers of sequences. The main idea is to first embed the  sequences into  a Riemannian manifold by  using positive definite regularized Gram matrices of  their Hankelets.  The  advantages of the this approach are: 1) it allows for using non-Euclidean similarity functions  on the Positive Definite matrix manifold, which capture better the underlying geometry than directly comparing the sequences or their  Hankel matrices; and 2)  Gram matrices inherit desirable properties from the underlying Hankel matrices: their rank  measure the complexity of the underlying dynamics, and the rank and the coefficients of the associated regressive models are  invariant to affine transformations and varying initial conditions. The benefits of this approach are illustrated with extensive experiments in 3D action recognition using 3D joints sequences. In spite of its simplicity,  the  performance of this approach is competitive or  better  than  using state-of-art approaches for this problem.  Further, these results hold across a variety of  metrics, supporting the idea that the improvement stems from the embedding itself, rather than from  using  one of these metrics.",

Existing methods in this context train relatively \"shallow\" networks limited by the issues arising in back propagation (e.g. vanishing gradients) as well as computational efficiency. We propose a novel and efficient training algorithm inspired by alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) that overcomes some of these limitations. Our method decomposes the training process into independent layer-wise local updates through auxiliary variables. Empirically we observe that our training algorithm always converges and its computational complexity is linearly proportional to the number of edges in the networks. Empirically we manage to train DNNs with 64 hidden layers and 1024 nodes per layer for supervised hashing in about 3 hours using a single GPU. Our proposed very deep supervised hashing (VDSH) method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on several benchmark datasets.",

Our method first recovers sparse pixel correspondences in the input images and stacks them into a matrix with many missing entries. We show that this matrix satisfies a rank two constraint under a simple color correction model. These parameters can be viewed as pseudo white balance and gamma correction parameters for each input image. We present a robust low-rank matrix factorization method to estimate the unknown parameters of this model. Using them, we improve color consistency of the input images or perform color transfer with any input image as the source. Our approach is insensitive to outliers in the pixel correspondences thereby precluding the need for complex pre-processing steps. We demonstrate high-quality color consistency results on large photo collections of popular tourist landmarks and personal photo collections containing images of people.",

As a result, existing datasets are limited to a few sequences and individuals, with limited accuracy, and this prevents these methods from delivering their full potential. We propose a semi-automated method for efficiently and accurately labeling each frame of a hand depth video with the corresponding 3D locations of the joints: The user is asked to provide only an estimate of the 2D reprojections of the visible joints in some reference frames, which are automatically selected to minimize the labeling work by efficiently optimizing a sub-modular loss function. We then exploit spatial, temporal, and appearance constraints to retrieve the full 3D poses of the hand over the complete sequence. We show that this data can be used to train a recent state-of-the-art hand pose estimation method, leading to increased accuracy.",

One key innovation is the creation of an EgoRetinal map, akin to an illustrated tourist map, that `rearranges' pixels taking into accounts depth information, the ground plane, and body motion direction, so that it allows motion planning and perception of objects on one image space. We learn to plan trajectories  directly on this EgoRetinal map using first person experience of walking around in a variety of scenes.  In a testing phase, given an novel scene, we find multiple hypotheses of future trajectories from the learned experience.  We refine them by minimizing a cost function that describes compatibility between the obstacles in the EgoRetinal map and trajectories.  We quantitatively evaluate our method to show predictive validity and apply to various real world daily activities including walking, shopping, and social interactions.",

        "abstract": "Recent algorithms in convolutional neural networks (CNN) considerably advance the fine-grained image classification, which aims to differentiate the subtle differences among subordinate classes. However, previous studies have rarely focused on learning a fined-grained and structured feature representation that is able to locate relevant images at different levels of relevance, e.g., discovering cars from the same make or the same model, both of which require high precision. In this paper, we propose two main contributions to tackle this problem. 1) A multi-task learning framework is designed to effectively learn fine-grained feature representations by jointly optimizing both classification and similarity constraints. 2) To model the multi-level relevance, label structures such as hierarchy or shared attributes are seamlessly embedded into the framework by generalizing the triplet loss. Extensive and thorough experiments have been conducted on three fine-grained datasets, i.e., the Stanford car, the car-333, and the food datasets, which contain either hierarchical labels or shared attributes. Our proposed method has achieved very competitive performance, i.e., among state-of-the-art classification accuracy. More importantly, it significantly outperforms previous fine-grained feature representations for image retrieval at different levels of relevance",

        "abstract": "Research in face perception and emotion theory requires very large annotated databases of images of facial expressions of emotion. Annotations should include Action Units (AUs) and their intensities as well as emotion category. This goal cannot be readily achieved manually. Herein, we present a novel computer vision algorithm to annotate a large database of one million images of facial expressions of emotion in the wild (i.e., face images downloaded from the Internet). First, we show that this newly proposed algorithm can recognize AUs and their intensities reliably across databases. To our knowledge, this is the first published algorithm to achieve highly-accurate results in the recognition of AUs and their intensities across multiple databases. Our algorithm also runs in real-time (>30 images/second), allowing it to work with large numbers of images and video sequences. Second, we use WordNet to download 1,000,000 images of facial expressions with associated emotion keywords from the Internet. These images are then automatically annotated with AUs, AU intensities and emotion categories by our algorithm. The result is a highly useful database that can be readily queried using semantic descriptions for applications in computer vision, affective computing, social and cognitive psychology and neuroscience; e.g., \"show me all the images with happy faces\" or \"all images with AU 1 at intensity c.\"",

        "abstract": "In this work we introduce a fully end-to-end approach for action detection in videos that learns to directly predict the temporal bounds of actions. Our intuition is that the process of detecting actions is naturally one of observation and refinement: observing moments in video, and refining hypotheses about when an action is occurring. Based on this insight, we formulate our model as a recurrent neural network-based agent that interacts with a video over time. The agent observes video frames and decides both where to look next and whether to emit a prediction. Since backpropagation is not adequate in this non-differentiable setting, we use REINFORCE to learn the agent's task-specific decision policy. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet datasets while observing only a fraction (2% or less) of the video frames.",

        "abstract": "Recently, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have been applied to the task of human pose estimation, and have shown its potential of learning better feature representations and capturing contextual relationships. However, it is difficult to incorporate domain prior knowledge such as geometric relationships among body parts into DCNNs. In addition, training DCNN-based body part detectors without consideration of global body joint consistency introduces ambiguities, which increases the complexity of training. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end framework for human pose estimation that combines DCNNs with the expressive deformable mixture of parts. We explicitly incorporate domain prior knowledge into the framework, which greatly regularizes the learning process and enables the flexibility of our framework for  loopy models or tree-structured models. The effectiveness of jointly learning a DCNN with a deformable mixture of parts model is evaluated through intensive experiments on several widely used benchmarks. The proposed approach significantly improves the performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches, especially on benchmarks with challenging articulations.",

Data-driven methods for training saliency models using eye-fixation data are increasingly popular, particularly with the introduction of large-scale datasets and deep architectures. However, current methods in this latter paradigm use loss functions designed for classification or regression tasks whereas saliency estimation is evaluated on topographical maps. In this work, we introduce a new saliency map model which formulates a map as a generalized Bernoulli distribution. We then train a deep architecture to predict such maps using novel loss functions which pair the softmax activation function with measures designed to compute distances between probability distributions. We show in extensive experiments the effectiveness of such loss functions over standard ones on four public benchmark datasets, and demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the-art saliency methods.",

Such nonlinear properties can be exploited by the so-called  kernel sparse coding. This paper proposed an equiangular kernel dictionary learning method with optimal mutual coherence to exploit  the nonlinear sparsity of  high-dimensional visual data. Two main issues are addressed in the proposed method: (1) coding stability for redundant dictionary of infinite-dimensional space; and (2) computational efficiency for computing kernel matrix of training samples of high-dimensional data. The proposed kernel sparse coding method is applied to dynamic texture analysis with both local DT pattern extraction and global DT pattern characterization. The experimental results showed its performance gain over existing methods.",

        "abstract": "During the past few years we have witnessed the development of many methodologies for building and fitting Statistical Deformable Models (SDMs). The construction of accurate SDMs requires careful annotation of images with regards to a consistent set of landmarks. However, the manual annotation of a large amount of images is a tedious, laborious and expensive procedure. Furthermore, for several deformable objects, e.g. human body, it is difficult to define a consistent set of landmarks, and, thus, it becomes impossible to train humans in order to accurately annotate a collection of images. Nevertheless, for the majority of objects, it is possible to extract the shape by object segmentation or even by shape drawing. In this paper, we show for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that it is possible to construct SDMs by putting object shapes in dense correspondence. Such SDMs can be built with much less effort for a large battery of objects. Additionally, we show that, by sampling the dense model, a part-based SDM can be learned with its parts being in correspondence. We employ our framework to develop SDMs of human arms and legs, which can be used for the segmentation of the outline of the human body, as well as to provide better and more consistent annotations for body joints.",

        "abstract": "Conventional algorithms for sparse signal recovery and sparse representation rely on l1-norm regularized variational methods. However, when applied to the reconstruction of sparse images, i.e., images where only a few pixels are non-zero, simple l1-norm-based methods ignore poten- tial correlations in the support between adjacent pixels. In a number of applications, one is interested in images that are not only sparse, but also have a support with smooth (or contiguous) boundaries. Existing algorithms that take into account such a support structure mostly rely on non-convex methods and--as a consequence--do not scale well to high-dimensional problems and/or do not converge to global optima. In this paper, we explore the use of new block l1-norm regularizers, which enforce image sparsity while simultaneously promoting smooth support structure. By exploiting the convexity of our regularizers, we develop new computationally-efficient recovery algorithms that guarantee global optimality. We demonstrate the efficacy of our regularizers on a variety of imaging tasks including compressive image recovery, image restoration, and robust PCA.",

        "abstract": "When creating a photo album of an event, people typically select a few important images to keep or share. There is some consistency in the process of choosing the important images, and discarding the unimportant ones. Modeling this selection process will assist automatic photo selection and album summarization. In this paper, we show that the selection of important images is consistent among different viewers, and that this selection process is related to the event type of the album. We introduce the concept of event-specific image importance. We collected a new event album dataset with human annotation of the relative image importance with each event album. We also propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based method to predict the image importance score of a given event album, using a novel rank loss function and a progressive training scheme. Results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms various baseline methods.",

While some previous methods aim to learn this \"knowledge\" from category-specific data, others transfer existing annotations in a large dataset through appearance matching. In contrast, we propose in this paper a locate-by-exemplar strategy. This approach is challenging, as we only use a few exemplars (up to 4) and the appearances among the query object and the exemplars can be very different. To address it, we design a two-stage deep model to learn the intra-class association between the exemplars and query objects. The first stage is for learning object-to-object association, and the second stage is to learn background discrimination. Extensive experimental evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms different baselines and the category-specific models. In addition, we explore the influence of exemplar properties, in terms of exemplar number and quality. Furthermore, we show that the learned model is a universal model and offers great generalization to unseen objects.",

The cascaded rejection classifiers (CRC) effectively utilize convolutional features and eliminate negative object proposals in a cascaded manner, which greatly speeds up the detection while maintaining high accuracy. In combination of the two, our method achieves significantly better accuracy compared to other state-of-the-arts in three challenging datasets, PASCAL object detection challenge, KITTI object detection benchmark and newly collected Inner-city dataset, while being more efficient.",

However, for multi-label images that contain multiple objects from different categories, scales and locations, global CNN features are not optimal. In this paper, we incorporate local information to enhance the feature discriminative power. In particular, we first extract object proposals from each image. With each image treated as a bag and object proposals extracted from it treated as instances, we transform the multi-label recognition problem into a multi-class multi-instance learning problem. Then, in addition to extracting the typical CNN feature representation from each proposal, we propose to make use of ground-truth bounding box annotations (strong labels) to add another level of local information by using nearest-neighbor relationships of local regions to form a multi-view pipeline. The proposed multi-view multi-instance framework utilizes both weak and strong labels effectively, and more importantly it has the generalization ability to even boost the performance of unseen categories by partial strong labels from other categories. Our framework is extensively compared with state-of-the-art hand-crafted feature based methods and CNN based methods on two multi-label benchmark datasets. The experimental results validate the discriminative power and the generalization ability of the proposed framework. With strong labels, our framework is able to achieve state-of-the-art results in both datasets.",

To resolve this issue, coding techniques are becoming increasingly popular in developing   snapshot systems for high-resolution hyperspectral imaging. For such systems, it is    a critical task to accurately restore the 3D hyperspectral image    from its corresponding coded 2D image. In this paper, we propose an    effective method for coded hyperspectral image restoration, which exploits extensive structure sparsity in the hyperspectral image. Specifically, we simultaneously explore spectral and spatial correlation via low-rank regularizations, and formulate the restoration problem into a variational optimization model, which can be solved via an iterative numerical algorithm. Experimental   results using both synthetic data and real images show that the proposed method can significantly outperform the    state-of-the-art methods on several popular coding-based hyperspectral imaging systems.",

Despite its range of applications, eye tracking has yet to become a pervasive technology. We believe that we can put the power of eye tracking in everyone's palm by building eye tracking software that works on commodity hardware such as mobile phones and tablets, without the need for additional sensors or devices. We tackle this problem by introducing GazeCapture, the first large-scale dataset for eye tracking, containing data from over 1450 people consisting of almost 2:5M frames. Using GazeCapture, we train iTracker, a convolutional neural network for eye tracking, which achieves a significant reduction in error over previous approaches while running in real time (10-15fps) on a modern mobile device. Our model achieves a prediction error of 1.71cm and 2.53cm without calibration on mobile phones and tablets respectively. With calibration, this is reduced to 1.34cm and 2.12cm. Further, we demonstrate that the features learned by iTracker generalize well to other datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results. The code, data, and models are available at http://gazecapture.csail.mit.edu.",

Our approach constructs a directed graph that can be efficiently explored for nearest neighbour queries. Each vertex in this graph represents a feature vector from the dataset being searched.  The directed edges are computed by exploiting the fact that, for these datasets, the intrinsic dimensionality of the local manifold-like structure formed by the elements of the dataset is significantly lower than the embedding space.  We also provide an efficient search algorithm that uses this graph to rapidly find the nearest neighbour to a query with high probability.   We show how the method can be adapted to give a strong guarantee of 100% recall where the query is within a threshold distance of its nearest neighbour. We demonstrate that our method is significantly more efficient than existing state of the art methods.  In particular, our GPU implementation can deliver 90% recall for queries on a data set of 1 million SIFT descriptors at a rate of over 1.2 million queries per second on a Titan X. Finally we also demonstrate how our method scales to datasets of 5M and 20M entries.",

The challenges are three-fold: Firstly, the commonly used landmark-based face model assumes that all the landmarks are visible and is therefore not suitable for profile views. Secondly, the face appearance varies more dramatically in large poses, ranging from frontal view to profile view. Thirdly, labelling landmarks in large poses is an extremely challenging work since the invisible landmarks have to be guessed. In this paper, we propose a solution to the three problems in an new alignment framework, called 3D Dense Face Alignment (3DDFA), in which a dense 3D face model is fitted to the image via convolutional neutral network (CNN). We also propose a method to synthesize large-scale training samples in profile views to solve the third problem of data labelling. Experiments on the challenging AFLW database show that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel approach for real-time facial reenactment of a monocular target video sequence (e.g., Youtube video). The source sequence is also a monocular video stream, captured live with a commodity webcam. Our goal is to animate the facial expressions of the target video by a source actor and re-render the manipulated output video in a photo-realistic fashion. To this end, we first address the under-constrained problem of facial identity recovery from monocular video by non-rigid model-based bundling. At run time, we track facial expressions of both source and target video using a dense photometric consistency measure. Reenactment is then achieved by fast and efficient deformation transfer between source and target. The mouth interior that best matches the re-targeted expression is retrieved from the target sequence and warped to produce an accurate fit. Finally, we convincingly re-render the synthesized target face on top of the corresponding video stream such that it seamlessly blends with the real-world illumination. We demonstrate our method in a live setup, where Youtube videos are reenacted in real time.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies on facial expression analysis have been focused on recognizing basic expression categories. There is limited amount of work on the continuous expression intensity estimation, which is important for detecting and tracking emotion change. Part of the reason is the lack of labeled data with annotated expression intensity since expression intensity annotation requires expertise and is time consuming. In this work, we treat the expression intensity estimation as a regression problem. By taking advantage of the natural onset-apex-offset evolution pattern of facial expression, the proposed method can handle different amounts of annotations to perform frame-level expression intensity estimation. In fully supervised case, all the frames are provided with intensity annotations. In weakly supervised case, only the annotations of selected key frames are used. While in unsupervised case, expression intensity can be estimated without any annotations. An efficient optimization algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is developed for solving the optimization problem associated with parameter learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method by comparing it against both fully supervised and unsupervised approaches on benchmark facial expression datasets.",

        "abstract": "Finetuning from a pretrained deep model is found to yield state-of-the-art performance for many vision tasks. This paper investigates many factors that influence the performance in finetuning for object detection.   There is a long-tailed distribution of sample numbers for classes in object detection. Our analysis and empirical results show that classes with more samples have higher impact on the feature learning. And it is better to make the sample number more uniform across classes. Generic object detection can be considered as multiple equally important tasks. Detection of each class is a task. These classes/tasks have their individuality in discriminative visual appearance representation. Taking this individuality into account, we cluster objects into visually similar class groups and learn deep representations for these groups separately. A hierarchical feature learning  scheme is proposed. In this scheme, the knowledge from the group with large number of classes is transferred for learning features in its sub-groups. Finetuned on the GoogLeNet model, experimental results show 4.7% absolute mAP improvement of our approach on the ImageNet object detection dataset without increasing much computational cost at the testing stage.",

In order to exploit data with weak labels, we jointly train a feature extraction network with a ranking loss and a classification network with a cross-entropy loss. We obtain high-quality compact discriminative features with few parameters, learned on relatively small datasets without additional annotations. This enables us to tackle tasks with specialized images not very similar to the more generic ones in existing fully-supervised datasets. We show that the resulting features in combination with a linear classifier surpass the state-of-the-art on the Hipster Wars dataset despite using features only 0.3% of the size. Our proposed features significantly outperform those obtained from networks trained on ImageNet, despite being 32 times smaller (128 single-precision floats), trained on noisy and weakly-labeled data, and using only 1.5% of the number of parameters.",

Image recognition for mobile phones is constrained by limited processing resources. The success of convolutional neural networks in these situations is limited by how fast we can compute them. Conventional FFT based convolution is fast for large filters, but state of the art convolutional neural networks use small, 3x3 filters. We introduce a new class of fast algorithms for convolutional neural networks using Winograd's minimal filtering algorithms. The algorithms compute minimal complexity convolution over small tiles, which makes them fast with small filters and small batch sizes.

In this paper, we propose two efficient algorithms for solving the linear and kernel SVM+, respectively. For linear SVM+, we absorb the bias term into the weight vector, and formulate a new optimization problem with simpler constraints in the dual form. Then, we develop an efficient dual coordinate descent algorithm to solve the new optimization problem. For kernel SVM+, we further apply the l2-loss, which leads to a simpler optimization problem in the dual form with only half of dual variables when compared with the dual form of the original SVM+ method. More interestingly, we show that our new dual problem can be efficiently solved by using the SMO algorithm of the one-class SVM problem. Comprehensive experiments on three datasets clearly demonstrate that our proposed algorithms achieve significant speed-up than the state-of-the-art solvers for linear and kernel SVM+.",

The approach uses the fact that many efficient implementations reduce generalized convolutions to matrix multiplications. The suggested brain damage process prunes the convolutional kernel tensor in a group-wise fashion. After such pruning, convolutions can be reduced to multiplications of thinned dense matrices, which leads to speedup. We investigate different ways to add group-wise prunning to the learning process, and show that several-fold speedups of convolutional layers can be attained using group-sparsity regularizers. Our approach can adjust the shapes of the receptive fields in the convolutional layers, and even prune excessive feature maps from ConvNets, all in a data-driven way.",

        "abstract": "Detecting edges is a fundamental problem in computer vision with many applications, some involving very noisy images. While most edge detection methods are fast, they perform well only on relatively clean images. Unfortunately, sophisticated methods that are robust to high levels of noise are quite slow. In this paper we develop a novel multiscale method to detect curved edges in noisy images. Even though our algorithm searches for edges over an exponentially large set of candidate curves, its runtime is nearly linear in the total number of image pixels. As we demonstrate experimentally, our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than previous methods designed to deal with high noise levels.  At the same time it obtains comparable and often superior results to existing methods on a variety of challenging noisy images.",

        "abstract": "In many large-scale video analysis scenarios, one is interested in localizing and recognizing human activities that occur in short temporal intervals within long untrimmed videos. Current approaches for activity detection still struggle to handle large-scale video collections and the task remains relatively unexplored. This is in part due to the computational complexity of current action recognition approaches and the lack of a method that proposes fewer intervals in the video, where activity processing can be focused. In this paper, we introduce a proposal method that aims to recover temporal segments containing actions in untrimmed videos. Building on techniques for learning sparse dictionaries, we introduce a learning framework to represent and retrieve activity proposals. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method in not only producing high quality proposals but also in its efficiency. Finally, we show the positive impact our method has on recognition performance when it is used for action detection, while running at 10FPS.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we aim to learn a mapping (or embedding) from images to a compact binary space in which Hamming distances correspond to a ranking measure for the image retrieval task. We make use of a triplet loss because this has been shown to be most effective for ranking problems. How- ever, training in previous works can be prohibitively expensive due to the fact that optimization is directly performed on the triplet space, where the number of possible triplets for training is cubic in the number of training examples. To address this issue, we propose to formulate high-order binary codes learning as a multi-label classification problem by explicitly separating learning into two interleaved stages. To solve the first stage, we design a large-scale high-order binary codes inference algorithm to reduce the high-order objective to a standard binary quadratic problem such that graph cuts can be used to efficiently infer the binary codes which serve as the labels of each training datum. In the second stage we propose to map the original image to compact binary codes via carefully designed deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the hash- ing function fitting can be solved by training binary CNN classifiers. An incremental/interleaved optimization strategy is proffered to ensure that these two steps are interactive with each other during training for better accuracy. We conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets, which demonstrate both improved training time (by as much as two orders of magnitude) as well as producing state-of-the- art hashing for various retrieval tasks.",

We study a particular image-word relevance relation in this paper. Our results tell that, given an image, its relevant tags' word vectors rank ahead of the irrelevant tags' along a principal direction in the word vector space. Inspired by this observation, we propose to solve image tagging by estimating the principal direction for an image. Particularly, we exploit linear mappings and nonlinear deep neural networks to approximate the principal direction from an input image. We arrive at a quite versatile tagging model. It runs fast given a test image, in constant time w.r.t. the training set size. It not only gives rise to superior performance for the conventional tagging task on the NUS-WIDE dataset, but also outperforms competitive baselines on annotating images with previously unseen tags. To this end, we name our approach fast zero-shot image tagging (Fast0Tag) to recognize that it possesses the advantages of both FastTag (Chen et al. 2013) and zero-shot learning.",

        "abstract": "Existing fine-grained visual categorization methods often suffer from three challenges: lack of training data, large number of fine-grained categories, and high intra-class vs. low inter-class variance. In this work we propose a generic iterative framework for fine-grained categorization and dataset bootstrapping that handles these three challenges. Using deep metric learning with humans in the loop, we learn a low dimensional feature embedding with anchor points on manifolds for each category. These anchor points capture intra-class variances and remain discriminative between classes. In each round, images with high confidence scores from our model are sent to humans for labeling. By comparing with exemplar images, labelers mark each candidate image as either a \"true positive\" or a \"false positive.\" True positives are added into our current dataset and false positives are regarded as \"hard negatives\" for our metric learning model. Then the model is re-trained with an expanded dataset and hard negatives for the next round. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we bootstrap a fine-grained flower dataset with 620 categories from Instagram images. The proposed deep metric learning scheme is evaluated on both our dataset and the CUB-200-2001 Birds dataset. Experimental evaluations show significant performance gain using dataset bootstrapping and demonstrate state-of-the-art results achieved by the proposed deep metric learning methods.",

Such ultra-fine grained image recognition is the key for many applications like search by images, but it is very challenging because it needs to discern subtle difference between classes while dealing with the scarcity of training data. Fortunately, the ultra-fine granularity naturally brings rich relationships among object classes. This paper proposes a novel approach to exploit the rich relationships through bipartite-graph labels (BGL). We show how to model BGL in an overall convolutional neural networks and the resulting system can be optimized through back-propagation. We also show that it is computationally efficient in inference thanks to the bipartite structure. To facilitate the study, we construct a new food benchmark dataset, which consists of 37,885 food images collected from 6 restaurants and totally 975 menus. Experimental results on this new food and three other datasets demonstrate BGL advances previous works in fine-grained object recognition.

In this paper we present FireCaffe, which successfully scales deep neural network training across a cluster of GPUs. We also present a number of best practices to aid in comparing advancements in methods for scaling and accelerating the training of deep neural networks. The speed and scalability of distributed algorithms is almost always limited by the overhead of communicating between servers; DNN training is not an exception to this rule. Therefore, the key consideration here is to reduce communication overhead wherever possible, while not degrading the accuracy of the DNN models that we train. Our approach has three key pillars. First, we select network hardware that achieves high bandwidth between GPU servers -- Infiniband or Cray interconnects are ideal for this. Second, we consider a number of communication algorithms, and we find that reduction trees are more efficient and scalable than the traditional parameter server approach. Third, we optionally increase the batch size to reduce the total quantity of communication during DNN training, and we identify hyperparameters that allow us to reproduce the small-batch accuracy while training with large batch sizes. When training GoogLeNet and Network-in-Network on ImageNet, we achieve a 47x and 39x speedup, respectively, when training on a cluster of 128 GPUs.",

        "abstract": "We focus on the problem of wearer's action recognition in first person a.k.a. egocentric videos. This problem is more challenging than third person activity recognition due to unavailability of wearer's pose and sharp movements in the videos caused by the natural head motion of the wearer. Carefully crafted features based on hands and objects cues for the problem have been shown to be successful for limited targeted datasets. We propose convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for end to end learning and classification of wearer's actions. The proposed network makes use of egocentric cues by capturing hand pose, head motion and saliency map. It is compact. It can also be trained from relatively small number of labeled egocentric videos that are available. We show that the proposed network can generalize and give state of the art performance on various disparate egocentric action datasets.",

        "abstract": "We present a fast, practical method for personalizing a hand shape basis to an individual user's detailed hand shape using only a small set of depth images. To achieve this, we minimize an energy based on a sum of render-and-compare cost functions called the golden energy. However, this energy is only piecewise continuous, due to pixels crossing occlusion boundaries, and is therefore not obviously amenable to efficient gradient-based optimization. A key insight is that the energy is the combination of a smooth low-frequency function with a high-frequency, low-amplitude, piecewise continuous function. A central finite difference approximation with a suitable step size can therefore jump over the discontinuities to obtain a good approximation to the energy's low-frequency behavior, allowing efficient gradient-based optimization. Experimental results quantitatively demonstrate for the first time that detailed personalized models improve the accuracy of hand tracking and achieve competitive results in both tracking and model registration.",

        "abstract": "A first-person video can generate powerful physical sensations of action in an observer. In this paper, we focus on a problem of Force from Motion---decoding the sensation of 1) passive forces such as the gravity, 2) the physical scale of the motion (speed) and space, and 3) active forces exerted by the observer such as pedaling a bike or banking on a ski turn.    The sensation of gravity can be observed in a natural image. We learn this image cue for predicting a gravity direction in a 2D image and integrate the prediction across images to estimate the 3D gravity direction using structure from motion. The sense of physical scale is revealed to us when the body is in a dynamically balanced state. We compute the unknown physical scale of 3D reconstructed camera motion by leveraging the torque equilibrium at a banked turn that relates the centripetal force, gravity, and the body leaning angle. The active force and torque governs 3D egomotion through the physics of rigid body dynamics. Using an inverse dynamics optimization, we directly minimize 2D reprojection error (in video) with respect to 3D world structure, active forces, and additional passive forces such as air drag and friction force. We use structure from motion with the physical scale and gravity direction as an initialization of our bundle adjustment for force estimation. Our method shows quantitatively equivalent reconstruction comparing to IMU measurements in terms of gravity and scale recovery and outperforms method based on 2D optical flow for an active action recognition task. We apply our method to first person videos of mountain biking, urban bike racing, skiing, speedflying with parachute, and wingsuit flying where inertial measurements are not accessible.",

        "abstract": "We investigate whether it is possible to improve the performance of automated facial forensic sketch matching by  learning from examples of facial forgetting over time. Forensic facial sketch recognition is a key capability for law enforcement, but remains an unsolved problem. It is extremely challenging because there are three distinct contributors to the domain gap between forensic sketches and photos: The well studied sketch-photo modality gap, and the less studied gaps due to (i) the forgetting process of the eye-witness and (ii) their inability to elucidate their memory. In this paper we address the memory problem head on by introducing a database of 400 forensic sketches created at different time-delays. Based on this database we build a model to reverse the forgetting process. Surprisingly, we show that it is possible to systematically \"un-forget\" facial details. Moreover, it is possible to apply this model to dramatically improve forensic sketch recognition in practice: we achieve state of the art results when matching 195 benchmark forensic sketches against corresponding photos and a 10,030 mugshot database.",

Lines can be rendered as curves due to the row-wise exposure mechanism known as rolling shutter (RS). We solve the problem of correcting distortions arising from handheld cameras due to RS effect from a single image free from motion blur with special relevance to urban scenes. We develop a procedure to extract prominent curves from the RS image since this is essential for deciphering the varying row-wise motion. We pose an optimization problem with line desirability costs based on straightness, angle, and length, to resolve the geometric ambiguities while estimating the camera motion based on a rotation-only model assuming known camera intrinsic matrix. Finally, we rectify the RS image based on the estimated camera trajectory using inverse mapping. We show rectification results for RS images captured using mobile phone cameras. We also compare our single image method against existing video and nonblind RS rectification methods that typically require multiple images.",

Current modeling techniques do not embrace the broad illumination range often leading to reconstruction failure or severe artifacts. We present an algorithm that leverages the appearance variety to obtain more complete and accurate scene geometry along with consistent multi-illumination appearance information. The proposed method relies on automatic scene appearance grouping, which is used to obtain separate dense 3D models. Subsequent model fusion combines the separate models into a complete and accurate reconstruction of the scene. In addition, we propose a method to derive the appearance information for the model under the different illumination conditions, even for scene parts that are not observed under one illumination condition. To achieve this, we develop a cross-illumination color transfer technique. We evaluate our method on a large variety of landmarks from across Europe reconstructed from a database of 7.4M images.",

This representative selection problem is formulated as a sparse dictionary selection problem, i.e., choosing a few representatives object proposals to reconstruct the whole proposal pool. Compared with existing sparse dictionary selection based representative selection methods, our new formulation can incorporate object proposal priors and locality prior in the feature space when selecting representatives. Consequently it can better locate key objects and suppress outlier proposals. We convert the optimization problem into a proximal gradient problem and solve it by the fast iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (FISTA). Experiments on synthetic data and real benchmark datasets show promising results of our key object summarization apporach in video content mining and search. Comparisons with existing representative selection approaches such as K-mediod, sparse dictionary selection and density based selection validate that our formulation can better capture the key video objects despite appearance variations, cluttered backgrounds and camera motions.",

However, the noise on real images can be much more complex empirically. This paper addresses this problem and proposes a novel blind image denoising algorithm which can cope with real-world noisy images even when the noise model is not provided. It is realized by modeling image noise with mixture of Gaussian distribution (MoG) which can approximate large varieties of continuous distributions. As the number of components for MoG is unknown practically, this work adopts Bayesian nonparametric technique and proposes a novel Low-rank MoG filter (LR-MoG) to recover clean signals (patches) from noisy ones contaminated by MoG noise. Based on LR-MoG, a novel blind image denoising approach is developed. To test the proposed method, this study conducts extensive experiments on synthesis and real images. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance consistently.",

        "abstract": "We present a global optimization approach to optical flow estimation. The approach optimizes a classical optical flow objective over the full space of mappings between discrete grids. No descriptor matching is used. The highly regular structure of the space of mappings enables optimizations that reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm's inner loop from quadratic to linear and support efficient matching of tens of thousands of nodes to tens of thousands of displacements. We show that one-shot global optimization of a classical Horn-Schunck-type objective over regular grids at a single resolution is sufficient to initialize continuous interpolation and achieve state-of-the-art performance on challenging modern benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a method for computing dense correspondence between a set of 3D face meshes using functional maps. The functional maps paradigm brings with it a number of advantages for face correspondence. First, it allows us to combine various notions of correspondence. We do so by proposing a number of face-specific functions, suited to either within- or between-subject correspondence. Second, we propose a groupwise variant of the method allowing us to compute cycle-consistent functional maps between all faces in a training set. Since functional maps are of much lower dimension than point-to-point correspondences, this is feasible even when the input meshes are very high resolution. Finally, we show how a functional map provides a geometric constraint that can be used to filter feature matches between non-rigidly deforming surfaces.",

We train a regressor to move and scale elements of the grid towards objects iteratively. G-CNN models the problem of object detection as finding a path from a fixed grid to boxes tightly surrounding the objects. G-CNN with around 180 boxes in a multi-scale grid performs comparably to Fast R-CNN which uses around 2K bounding boxes generated with a proposal technique. This strategy makes detection faster by removing the object proposal stage as well as reducing the number of boxes to be processed.",

        "abstract": "Projective analysis is an important solution for 3D shape retrieval, since human visual perceptions of 3D shapes rely on various 2D observations from different view points. Although multiple informative and discriminative views are utilized, most projection-based retrieval systems suffer from heavy computational cost, thus cannot satisfy the basic requirement of scalability for search engines.  In this paper, we present a real-time 3D shape search engine based on the projective images of 3D shapes. The real-time property of our search engine results from the following aspects: (1) efficient projection and view feature extraction using GPU acceleration; (2) the first inverted file, referred as F-IF, is utilized to speed up the procedure of multi-view matching; (3) the second inverted file (S-IF), which captures a local distribution of 3D shapes in the feature manifold, is adopted for efficient context-based reranking. As a result, for each query the retrieval task can be finished within one second despite the necessary cost of IO overhead. We name the proposed 3D shape search engine, which combines GPU acceleration and Inverted File (Twice), as GIFT. Besides its high efficiency, GIFT also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly in retrieval accuracy on various shape benchmarks and competitions",

        "abstract": "Gaussian mixture alignment is a family of approaches that are frequently used for robustly solving the point-set registration problem. However, since they use local optimisation, they are susceptible to local minima and can only guarantee local optimality. Consequently, their accuracy is strongly dependent on the quality of the initialisation. This paper presents the first globally-optimal solution to the 3D rigid Gaussian mixture alignment problem under the L2 distance between mixtures. The algorithm, named GOGMA, employs a branch-and-bound approach to search the space of 3D rigid motions SE(3), guaranteeing global optimality regardless of the initialisation. The geometry of SE(3) was used to find novel upper and lower bounds for the objective function and local optimisation was integrated into the scheme to accelerate convergence without voiding the optimality guarantee. The evaluation empirically supported the optimality proof and showed that the method performed much more robustly on two challenging datasets than an existing globally-optimal registration solution.",

        "abstract": "In contrast to the existing approaches that use discrete Conditional Random Field (CRF) models, we propose to use a Gaussian CRF model for the task of semantic segmentation. We propose a novel deep network, which we refer to as Gaussian Mean Field (GMF) network, whose layers perform mean field inference over a Gaussian CRF. The proposed GMF network has the desired property that each of its layers produces an output that is closer to the maximum a posteriori solution of the Gaussian CRF compared to its input. By combining the proposed GMF network with deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we propose a new end-to-end trainable Gaussian conditional random field network. The proposed Gaussian CRF network is composed of three sub-networks: (i) a CNN-based unary network for generating unary potentials, (ii) a CNN-based pairwise network for generating pairwise potentials, and (iii) a GMF network for performing Gaussian CRF inference. When trained end-to-end in a discriminative fashion, and evaluated on the challenging PASCALVOC 2012 segmentation dataset, the proposed Gaussian CRF network outperforms various recent semantic segmentation approaches that combine CNNs with discrete CRF models.",

We introduce a new dataset, GeoMat, which is the first to provide both image and geometry data in the form of: (i) training and testing patches that were extracted at different scales and perspectives from real world examples of each material category, and (ii) a large scale construction site scene that includes 160 images and over 800,000 hand labeled 3D points. Our results show that using 2D and 3D features both jointly and independently to model materials improves classification accuracy across multiple scales and viewing directions for both material patches and images of a large scale construction site scene.",

        "abstract": "The growing availability of very high resolution (<1 m/pixel) satellite and aerial images has opened up unprecedented opportunities to monitor and analyze the evolution of land-cover and land-use across the world. To do so, images of the same geographical areas acquired at different times and, potentially, with different sensors must be efficiently parsed to update maps and detect land-cover changes. However, a naive transfer of ground truth labels from one location in the source image to the corresponding location in the target image is not generally feasible, as these images are often only loosely registered (with up to +- 50m of non-uniform errors). Furthermore, land-cover changes in an area over time must be taken into account for an accurate ground truth transfer. To tackle these challenges, we propose a mid-level sensor-invariant representation that encodes image regions in terms of the spatial distribution of their spectral neighbors. We incorporate this representation in a Markov Random Field to simultaneously account for nonlinear mis-registrations and enforce locality priors to find matches between multi-sensor images. We show how our approach can be used to assist in several multimodal land-cover update and change detection problems.",

        "abstract": "Given a set of surface normals, we pose a Manhattan Frame (MF) estimation problem as a consensus set maximization that maximizes the number of inliers over the rotation search space. We solve this problem through a branch-and-bound framework, which mathematically guarantees a globally optimal solution. However, the computational time of conventional branch-and-bound algorithms are intractable for real-time performance. In this paper, we propose a novel bound computation method within an efficient measurement domain for MF estimation, i.e., the extended Gaussian image (EGI). By relaxing the original problem, we can compute the bounds in real-time, while preserving global optimality. Furthermore, we quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate the performance of the proposed method for synthetic and real-world data. We also show the versatility of our approach through two applications: extension to multiple MF estimation and video stabilization.",

        "abstract": "High computational cost is the main obstacle to adapting globally optimal branch-and-bound algorithms to intensity-based registration. Existing techniques to speed up such algorithms use a multiresolution pyramid of images and bounds on the target function among different resolutions for rigidly aligning two images. In this paper, we propose a dual algorithm in which the optimization is done in the Fourier domain, and multiple resolution levels are replaced by multiple frequency bands. The algorithm starts by computing the target function in lower frequency bands and keeps adding higher frequency bands until the current subregion is either rejected or divided into smaller areas in a branch and bound manner. Unlike spatial multiresolution approaches, to compute the target function for a wider frequency area, one just needs to compute the target in the residual bands. Therefore, if an area is to be discarded, it performs just enough computations required for the rejection. This property also enables us to use a rather large number of frequency bands compared to the limited number of resolution levels used in the space domain algorithm. Experimental results on real images demonstrate considerable speed gains over the space domain method in most cases.",

Recent work has shown that features such as hand appearance, object attributes, local hand motion and camera ego-motion are important for characterizing first-person actions. To integrate these ideas under one framework, we propose a twin stream network architecture, where one stream analyzes appearance information and the other stream analyzes motion information. Our appearance stream encodes prior knowledge of the egocentric paradigm by explicitly training the network to segment hands and localize objects. By visualizing certain neuron activation of our network, we show that our proposed architecture naturally learns features that capture object attributes and hand-object configurations. Our extensive experiments on benchmark egocentric action datasets show that our deep architecture enables recognition rates that significantly outperform state-of-the-art techniques - an average 6.6% increase in accuracy over all datasets. Furthermore, by learning to recognize objects, actions and activities jointly, the performance of individual recognition tasks also increase by 30% (actions) and 14% (objects). We also include the results of extensive ablative analysis to highlight the importance of network design decisions.",

The existing method for manipulating base structures and detailed textures are classifiable into two major approaches: i) gradient-domain and ii) layer-decomposition. To generate detail-preserving and artifact-free output images, we combine the benefits of the two approaches into the proposed framework by introducing the intensity-range constraint and the base-structure constraint. To preserve details of the input image, the proposed method takes advantage of reconstructing the output image in the gradient domain, while the output intensity is guaranteed to lie within the specified intensity range, e.g. 0-to-255, by the intensity-range constraint. In addition, the reconstructed image lies close to the base structure by the base-structure constraint, which is effective for restraining artifacts. Experimental results show that the proposed framework is effective for various applications such as tone mapping, seamless image cloning, detail enhancement, and image restoration.",

In particular, an untrainable deep network starts as a trainable shallow network and newly added layers are slowly, organically added during training, thereby increasing the network's depth. This is accomplished by a new layer, which we call DropIn. The DropIn layer starts by passing the output from a previous layer (effectively skipping over the newly added layers), then increasingly including units from the new layers for both feedforward and backpropagation. We show that deep networks, which are untrainable with conventional methods, will converge with DropIn layers interspersed in the architecture. In addition, we demonstrate that DropIn provides regularization during training in an analogous way as dropout. Experiments are described with the MNIST dataset and various expanded LeNet architectures, CIFAR-10 dataset with its architecture expanded from 3 to 11 layers, and on the ImageNet dataset with the AlexNet architecture expanded to 13 layers and the VGG 16-layer architecture.",

We formulate point set registration as a modified N-body problem with additional constraints and obtain an algorithm with unique properties which is fully scalable with the number of processing cores. In GA, a template point set moves in a viscous medium under gravitational forces induced by a reference point set. Pose updates are completed by numerically solving the differential equations of Newtonian mechanics. We discuss techniques for efficient implementation of the new algorithm and evaluate it on several synthetic and real-world scenarios. GA is compared with the widely used Iterative Closest Point and the state of the art rigid Coherent Point Drift algorithms. Experiments evidence that the new approach is robust against noise and can handle challenging scenarios with structured outliers.",

        "abstract": "Objective image quality assessment (IQA) models aim to automatically predict human visual perception of image quality and are of fundamental importance in the field of image processing and computer vision. With an increasing number of IQA models proposed, how to fairly compare their performance becomes a major challenge due to the enormous size of the image space and the limited resource for subjective testing. The standard approach in the literature is to compute several correlation metrics between subjective mean opinion scores (MOSs) and objective model predictions on several well-known subject-rated databases that contain distorted images generated from a few dozens of source images, which provide an extremely limited representation of real-world images. Moreover, most IQA models were developed after these databases became publicly available and often involve machine learning or manual parameter tuning steps to boost their performance on these databases, and thus their generalization capabilities are questionable. Here we propose a substantially different methodology to compare IQA models. We first build a database that contains 4,744 source natural images, together with 94,880 distorted images created from them. We then propose a novel mechanism, namely group MAximum Differentiation (gMAD) competition, that helps automatically select subsets of image pairs from the database that provide the strongest test to let the IQA models compete with each other. Subjective testing on the selected subsets reveals the relative performance of the IQA models and provides useful insights on potential ways to improve them. We report the gMAD competition results between 16 well-known IQA models, but the framework is extendable, allowing future IQA models to be added into the competition.",

        "abstract": "Automatic tracking of large-scale crowded targets are of particular importance in many applications, such as crowded people/vehicle tracking in video surveillance, fiber tracking in materials science, and cell tracking in biomedical imaging. This problem becomes very challenging when the targets show similar appearance and the inter-slice/inter-frame continuity is low due to sparse sampling, camera motion and target occlusion. The main challenge comes from the step of association which aims at matching the predictions and the observations of the multiple targets. In this paper we propose a new groupwise method to explore the target group information and employ the within-group correlations for association and tracking. In particular, the within-group association is modeled by a nonrigid 2D Thin-Plate transform and a sequence of group shrinking, group growing and group merging operations are then developed to refine the composition of each group. We apply the propose method to track large-scale fibers from the microscopy material images and compare its performance against several other multi-target tracking methods. We also apply the proposed method to track crowded people from videos with poor inter-frame continuity.",

Solving the problem exactly is computationally demanding, and the effort required increases rapidly with the problem size. Although randomized algorithms are much more efficient, the optimality of the solution is not guaranteed. Towards the goal of solving maximum consensus exactly, we present guaranteed outlier removal as a technique to reduce the runtime of exact algorithms. Specifically, before conducting global optimization, we attempt to remove data that are provably true outliers, i.e., those that do not exist in the maximum consensus set. We propose an algorithm based on mixed integer linear programming to perform the removal. The result of our algorithm is a smaller data instance that admits much faster solution by a subsequent exact algorithm, while yielding the same globally optimal result as the original problem. We demonstrate that overall speedups of up to 80% can be achieved on common vision problems.",

Towards this goal, we propose an efficient approach that is able to estimate these fine grained categories by doing joint inference over both, monocular aerial imagery, as well as ground images taken from a stereo camera pair mounted on top of a car. Important to this is reasoning about the alignment between the two types of imagery, as even when the measurements are taken with sophisticated GPS+IMU systems, this alignment is not sufficiently accurate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a new dataset which enhances KITTI [8] with aerial images taken with a camera mounted on an airplane and flying around the city of Karlsruhe, Germany.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale action recognition and video categorization are important problems in computer vision. To address these problems, we propose a novel object- and scene-based semantic fusion network and representation. Our semantic fusion network combines three streams of information using a three-layer neural network: (i) frame-based low-level CNN features, (ii) object features from a state-of-the-art large-scale CNN object-detector trained to recognize 20K classes, and (iii) scene features from a state-of-the-art CNN scene-detector trained to recognize 205 scenes. The trained network achieves improvements in supervised activity and video categorization in two complex large-scale datasets -  ActivityNet and FCVID, respectively. Further, by examining and back propagating information through the fusion network, semantic relationships (correlations) between video classes and objects/scenes can be discovered. These video class-object/video class-scene relationships can in turn be used as semantic representation for the video classes themselves. We illustrate effectiveness of this semantic representation through experiments on zero-shot action/video classification and clustering.",

However, as the features from a certain CNN layer characterize an object of interest from only one aspect or one level, the performance of such trackers trained with features from one layer (usually the last second layer) can be further improved. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN based tracking framework, which takes full advantage of features from different CNN layers and uses an adaptive Hedge method to hedge several CNN trackers into a stronger one. Extensive experiments on a benchmark dataset of 100 challenging image sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with several state-of-the-art trackers.",

We propose a more general multi-object segmentation approach. Moreover, each object can be constrained by a more descriptive shape prior, \"hedgehog\". Each hedgehog shape has its surface normals locally constrained by an arbitrary given vector field, e.g. gradient of the user-scribble distance transform. In contrast to star-convexity, the tightness of our normal constraint can be changed giving better control over allowed shapes. For example, looser constraints, i.e. wider cones of allowed normals, give more relaxed hedgehog shapes. On the other hand, the tightest constraint enforces skeleton consistency with the scribbles. In general, hedgehog shapes are more descriptive than a star, which is only a special case corresponding to a radial vector field and weakest tightness. Our approach has significantly more applications than standard single star-convex segmentation, e.g. in medical data we can separate multiple non-star organs with similar appearances and weak edges. Optimization is done by our modified a-expansion moves shown to be submodular for multi-hedgehog shapes.",

It also extends capabilities beyond those of traditional methods. Previously, constant intensity has been assumed for estimating disparity of orientation in most approaches to analyze epipolar plane images (EPIs). Here, we introduce a modified structure tensor approach which improves depth estimation. This extension also includes a model of non-constant intensity on EPI manifolds. We derive an approach to estimate high quality depth maps in luminance-gradient light fields, as well as in color-filtered light fields. Color-filtered light fields pose particular challenges due to the fact that structures can change significantly in appearance with wavelength and can completely vanish at some wavelength. We demonstrate solutions to this challenge and obtain a dense sRGB image reconstruction in addition to dense depth maps.",

        "abstract": "Describing the color and textural information of a person image is one of the most crucial aspects of person re-identification. In this paper, we present a novel descriptor based on a hierarchical distribution of pixel features. A hierarchical covariance descriptor has been successfully applied for image classification. However, the mean information of pixel features, which is absent in covariance, tends to be major discriminative information of person images. To solve this problem, we describe a local region in an image via hierarchical Gaussian distribution in which both means and covariances are included in their parameters. More specifically, we model the region as a set of multiple Gaussian distributions in which each Gaussian represents the appearance of a local patch. The characteristics of the set of Gaussians are again described by another Gaussian distribution. In both steps, unlike the hierarchical covariance descriptor, the proposed descriptor can model both the mean and the covariance information of pixel features properly. The results of experiments conducted on five databases indicate that the proposed descriptor exhibits remarkably high performance which outperforms the state-of-the-art descriptors for person re-identification.",

        "abstract": "Recently, deep learning approach, especially deep Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets), have achieved overwhelming accuracy with fast processing speed for image classification. Incorporating temporal structure with deep ConvNets for video representation becomes a fundamental problem for video content analysis.  In this paper, we propose a new approach, namely Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Encoder (HRNE), to exploit temporal information of videos. Compared to recent video representation inference approaches, this paper makes the following three contributions.  First, our HRNE is able to efficiently exploit video temporal structure in a longer range by reducing the length of input information flow, and compositing multiple consecutive inputs at a higher level. Second, computation operations are significantly lessened while attaining more non-linearity. Third, HRNE is able to uncover temporal transitions between frame chunks with different granularities, i.e. it can model the temporal transitions between frames as well as the transitions between segments. We apply the new method to video captioning where temporal information plays a crucial role. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on video captioning benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Semantic segmentation aims to parse the scene structure of images by annotating the labels to each pixel so that images can be segmented into different regions.   While image structures usually have various scales, it is difficult to use a single scale to model the spatial contexts for all individual pixels.  Multi-scale Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their variants have made striking success for modeling the global scene structure for an image. However, they are limited in labeling fine-grained local structures like pixels and patches, since spatial contexts might be  blindly mixed up without appropriately customizing their scales.  To address this challenge, we develop a novel paradigm of multi-scale deep network to model spatial contexts surrounding different pixels at various scales.  It builds multiple layers of memory cells, learning feature representations for individual pixels at their customized scales by hierarchically absorbing relevant spatial contexts via memory gates between layers.Such Hierarchically Gated Deep Networks (HGDNs) can customize a suitable scale for each pixel, thereby delivering better performance on labeling scene structures of various scales.  We conduct the experiments on two datasets, and show competitive results compared with the other multi-scale deep networks on the semantic segmentation task.",

As opposed to prior methods that recover scene geometry and camera motions using pre-calibrated cameras, we introduce a self-calibrating bundle adjustment tailored for small motion. This allows our dense stereo algorithm to produce a high-quality depth map for the user without the need for camera calibration. In the dense matching, the distributions of intensity profiles are analyzed to leverage the benefit of having negligible intensity changes within the scene due to the minuscule variation in viewpoint. The depth maps obtained by the proposed framework show accurate and extremely fine structures that are unmatched by previous literature under the same small motion configuration.",

Browsing such long unstructured videos is time-consuming and tedious. This paper studies the discovery of moments of user's major or special interest (i.e., highlights) in a video, for generating the summarization of first-person videos. Specifically, we propose a novel pairwise deep ranking model that employs deep learning techniques to learn the relationship between highlight and non-highlight video segments. A two-stream network structure by representing video segments from complementary information on appearance of video frames and temporal dynamics across frames is developed for video highlight detection. Given a long personal video, equipped with the highlight detection model, a highlight score is assigned to each segment. The obtained highlight segments are applied for summarization in two ways: video timelapse and video skimming. The former plays the highlight (non-highlight) segments at low (high) speed rates, while the latter assembles the sequence of segments with the highest scores. On 100 hours of first-person videos for 15 unique sports categories, our highlight detection achieves the improvement over the state-of-the-art RankSVM method by 10.5% in terms of accuracy. Moreover, our approaches produce video summary with better quality by a user study from 35 human subjects.",

Such a task essentially is challenging because the available information (e.g. motion vector) to describe vehicles in videos is quite limited and inaccurate, and the vehicle count in realistic traffic scenes always varies greatly. To tackle this issue, we first develop a batch of low-level features, which can be extracted from the encoding metadata of videos, to mitigate the informational insufficiency of compressed videos. Then we propose a Hierarchical Classification based Regression (HCR) model to estimate the vehicle count from features. HCR hierarchically divides the traffic scenes into different cases according to vehicle density, such that the broad-variation characteristics of traffic scenes can be better approximated. Finally, we evaluated the proposed method on the real highway surveillance videos. The results show that our method is very competitive to the pixel-domain methods, which can reach similar performance along with its lower complexity.",

We find that any two ellipses have a unique common self-polar triangle, which can provide three line correspondences. Furthermore, by investigating the location features of the common self-polar triangle, we show that one vertex of the triangle lies outside of both ellipses, while the other two vertices lies inside the ellipses separately. Accordingly, one more line correspondence can be obtained from the intersections of the conics and the common self-polar triangle. Therefore, four line correspondences can be obtained based on the common self-polar triangle, which can provide enough constraints for the homography estimation. The main contributions in this paper include: (1) A new discovery on the location features of the common self-polar triangle of separate ellipses. (2) A novel approach for homography estimation.

Our results characterise both localisation and background-versus-foreground errors.  To address localisation errors we study the impact of training annotation noise on the detector performance, and show that we can improve even with a small portion of sanitised training data. To address background/foreground discrimination, we study convnets for pedestrian detection, and discuss which factors affect their performance.

        "abstract": "We address the problem of estimating image difficulty defined as the human response time for solving a visual search task. We collect human annotations of image difficulty for the PASCAL VOC 2012 data set through a crowd-sourcing platform. We then analyze what human interpretable image properties can have an impact on visual search difficulty, and how accurate are those properties for predicting difficulty. Next, we build a regression model based on deep features learned with state of the art convolutional neural networks and show better results for predicting the ground-truth visual search difficulty scores produced by human annotators. Our model is able to correctly rank about 75% image pairs according to their difficulty score. We also show that our difficulty predictor generalizes well to new classes not seen during training. Finally, we demonstrate that our predicted difficulty scores are useful for weakly supervised object localization (8% improvement) and semi-supervised object classification (1% improvement).",

        "abstract": "Hierarchical feature extractors such as Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) have achieved impressive performance on a variety of classification tasks using purely feedforward processing. Feedforward architectures can learn rich representations of the input space but do not explicitly model dependencies in the output spaces, that are quite structured for tasks such as articulated human pose estimation or object segmentation. Here we propose a framework that expands the expressive power of hierarchical feature extractors to encompass both input and output spaces, by introducing top-down feedback. Instead of directly predicting the outputs in one go, we use a self-correcting model that progressively changes an initial solution by feeding back error predictions, in a process we call Iterative Error Feedback (IEF). IEF shows excellent performance on the task of articulated pose estimation in the challenging MPII and LSP benchmarks, matching the state-of-the-art without requiring ground truth scale annotation.",

        "abstract": "Structured light sensors are popular due to their robustness to untextured scenes and multipath. These systems triangulate depth by solving a correspondence problem between each camera and projector pixel. This is often framed as a local stereo matching task, correlating patches of pixels in the observed and reference image. However, this is computationally intensive, leading to reduced depth accuracy and framerate. We contribute an algorithm for solving this correspondence problem efficiently, without compromising depth accuracy. For the first time, this problem is cast as a classification-regression task, which we solve extremely efficiently using an ensemble of cascaded random forests. Our algorithm scales in number of disparities, and each pixel can be processed independently, and in parallel. No matching or even access to the corresponding reference pattern is required at runtime, and regressed labels are directly mapped to depth. Our GPU-based algorithm runs at a 1KHz for 1.3MP input/output images, with disparity error of 0.1 subpixels. We show a prototype high framerate depth camera running at 375Hz, useful for solving tracking-related problems. We demonstrate our algorithmic performance, creating high resolution real-time depth maps that surpass the quality of current state of the art depth technologies, highlighting quantization-free results with reduced holes, edge fattening and other stereo-based depth artifacts.",

        "abstract": "Almost all of the current top-performing object detection networks employ region proposals to guide the search for object instances. State-of-the-art region proposal methods usually need several thousand proposals to get high recall, thus hurting the detection efficiency. Although the latest Region Proposal Network method gets promising detection accuracy with several hundred proposals, it still struggles in small-size object detection and precise localization (e.g., large IoU thresholds), mainly due to the coarseness of its feature maps. In this paper, we present a deep hierarchical network, namely HyperNet, for handling region proposal generation and object detection jointly. Our HyperNet is primarily based on an elaborately designed Hyper Feature which aggregates hierarchical feature maps first and then compresses them into a uniform space. The Hyper Features well incorporate deep but highly semantic, intermediate but really complementary, and shallow but naturally high-resolution features of the image, thus enabling us to construct HyperNet by sharing them both in generating proposals and detecting objects via an end-to-end joint training strategy. For the deep VGG16 model, our method achieves completely leading recall and state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 using only 100 proposals per image. It runs with a speed of 5 fps (including all steps) on a GPU, thus having the potential for real-time processing.",

The proposed technique exploits the projection of planes in the v-disparity image paired with Bayesian linear regression to reliably identify training image pixels belonging to free space in a scene. Unlike other methods in the literature, the algorithm does not require any prior training, has only one free parameter, and is shown to provide consistent results over a variety of terrains without the need for any manual tuning. The proposed method is compared to two other data extraction methods from the literature. Results of Support Vector classifiers using training data extracted by the proposed technique are superior in terms of quality and consistency of free space estimation. Furthermore, the computation time required by the proposed technique is shown to be smaller and more consistent than that of other training data extraction methods.",

        "abstract": "Automatically generating a natural language description of an image has attracted interests recently both because of its importance in practical applications and because it connects two major artificial intelligence fields: computer vision and natural language processing. Existing approaches are either top-down, which start from a gist of an image and convert it into words, or bottom-up, which come up with words describing various aspects of an image and then combine them. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that combines both approaches through a model of semantic attention. Our algorithm learns to selectively attend to semantic concept proposals and fuse them into hidden states and outputs of recurrent neural networks. The selection and fusion form a feedback connecting the top-down and bottom-up computation.  We evaluate our algorithm on two public benchmarks: Microsoft COCO and Flickr30K. Experimental results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches consistently across different evaluation metrics.",

        "abstract": "Removing image blur caused by camera shake is an ill-posed problem, as both the latent image and the point spread function (PSF) are unknown. A recent approach to address this problem is to record camera motion through inertial sensors, i.e., gyroscopes and accelerometers, and then reconstruct spatially-variant PSFs from these readings. While this approach has been effective for high-quality inertial sensors, it has been infeasible for the inertial sensors in smartphones, which are of relatively low quality and present a number of challenging issues, including varying sensor parameters, high sensor noise, and calibration error. In this paper, we identify the issues that plague smartphone inertial sensors and propose a solution that successfully utilizes the sensor readings for image deblurring. With both the sensor data and the image itself, the proposed method is able to accurately estimate the sensor parameters online and also the spatially-variant PSFs for enhanced deblurring performance. The effectiveness of this technique is demonstrated in experiments on a popular mobile phone. With this approach, the quality of image deblurring can be appreciably raised on the most common of imaging devices.",

For the adaptive parameter prediction, we employ a separate parameter prediction network, which consists of gated recurrent unit (GRU) taking a question as its input and a fully-connected layer generating a set of candidate weights as its output. However, it is challenging to construct a parameter prediction network for a large number of parameters in the fully-connected dynamic parameter layer of the CNN. We reduce the complexity of this problem by incorporating a hashing technique, where the candidate weights given by the parameter prediction network are selected using a predefined hash function to determine individual weights in the dynamic parameter layer. The proposed network---joint network with the CNN for ImageQA and the parameter prediction network---is trained end-to-end through back-propagation, where its weights are initialized using a pre-trained CNN and GRU. The proposed algorithm illustrates the state-of-the-art performance on all available public ImageQA benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Rendering the semantic content of an image in different styles is a difficult image processing task. Arguably, a major limiting factor for previous approaches has been the lack of image representations that explicitly represent semantic information and, thus, allow to separate image content from style. Here we use image representations derived from Convolutional Neural Networks optimised for object recognition, which make high level image information explicit. We introduce A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style that can separate and recombine the image content and style of natural images. The algorithm allows us to produce new images of high perceptual quality that combine the content of an arbitrary photograph with the appearance of numerous well-known artworks. Our results provide new insights into the deep image representations learned by Convolutional Neural Networks and demonstrate their potential for high level image synthesis and manipulation.",

There has been considerable research on generating compact binary codes in vision, for example for visual search tasks. However the issue of efficient searching through huge sets of binary codes remains largely unsolved. To this end, we propose a novel, unsupervised approach to thresholded search in Hamming space, supporting long codes (e.g. 512-bits) with a wide-range of Hamming distance radii. Our method is capable of working efficiently with billions of codes delivering between one to three orders of magnitude acceleration, as compared to prior art. This is achieved by relaxing the equal-size constraint in the Multi-Index Hashing approach, leading to multiple hash-tables with variable length hash-keys. Based on the theoretical analysis of the retrieval probabilities of multiple hash-tables we propose a novel search algorithm for obtaining a suitable set of hash-key lengths. The resulting retrieval mechanism is shown empirically to improve the efficiency over the state-of-the-art, across a range of datasets, bit-depths and retrieval thresholds.",

Although there has been much progress in person re-identification for the last decade, it still remains a challenging task because of severe appearance changes of a person due to diverse camera viewpoints and person poses. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for person re-identification by analyzing camera viewpoints and person poses, so-called Pose-aware Multi-shot Matching (PaMM), which robustly estimates target poses and efficiently conducts multi-shot matching based on the target pose information. Experimental results using public person re-identification dataset show that the proposed methods are promising for person re-identification under diverse viewpoints and pose variances.",

We present a general stability training method to stabilize deep networks against small input distortions that result from various types of common image processing, such as compression, rescaling, and cropping. We validate our method by stabilizing the state-of-the-art Inception architecture against these types of distortions. In addition, we demonstrate that our stabilized model gives robust state-of-the-art performance on large-scale near-duplicate detection, similar-image ranking, and classification on noisy datasets.",

However, most sparse representation based trackers have high computational cost, less than promising tracking performance, and limited feature representation. To deal with the above issues, we propose a novel circulant sparse tracker (CST), which exploits circulant target templates. Because of the circulant structure property, CST has the following advantages: (1) It can refine and reduce particles using circular shifts of target templates. (2) The optimization can be efficiently solved entirely in the Fourier domain. (3) High dimensional features can be embedded into CST to significantly improve tracking performance without sacrificing much computation time. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on challenging benchmark sequences demonstrate that CST performs better than all other sparse trackers and favorably against state-of-the-art methods.",

Our algorithm is based on the observation that human performance on this task is based both on prior knowledge about plausible shapes and taking into account the presence of occluding objects whose shape is already known - once an occluded region is identified, the shape prior can be used to guess the shape of the missing part. We capture the former aspect using a deep learning model of shape; for the latter, we simultaneously minimize the energy of all regions and consider only unoccluded pixels for data agreement.   Existing algorithms incorporating object shape priors consider every object separately in turn and can't distinguish genuine deviation from the expected shape from parts missing due to occlusion. We show that our method significantly improves on the performance of a representative algorithm, as evaluated on both preprocessed natural and synthetic images. Furthermore, on the synthetic images, we recover the ground truth segmentation with good accuracy.",

A core part of our approach is a novel Limited Horizon Minimum Spanning Tree (LH-MST) structure that closely approximates the Minimum Spanning Tree at a small fraction of the latter's computational cost. Our proposed tree structure can be created in a local neighborhood of the matching graph during image retrieval and can be efficiently updated whenever the image database is extended. We show how the LH-MST can be used within both single-link hierarchical agglomer- ative clustering and the Iconoid Shift framework for object discovery in image collections, resulting in significant efficiency gains and making both approaches capable of incremental clustering with online updates. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 500k images from the city of Paris and compare its results to the batch version of both clustering algorithms.",

        "abstract": "We present a global and convex formulation for template-less 3D reconstruction of a deforming object with the perspective camera.    We show for the first time how to construct a Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP) problem for Non-Rigid Shape-from-Motion (NRSfM) using the Maximum-Depth Heuristic (MDH).    In this regard, we deviate strongly from the general trend of using affine cameras and factorization-based methods to solve NRSfM.    In MDH, the points' depths are maximized so that the distance between neighbouring points in camera space are upper bounded by the geodesic distance.    In NRSfM both geodesic and camera space distances are unknown.    We show that, nonetheless, given point correspondences and the camera's intrinsics the whole problem is convex and solvable with SOCP. We show with extensive experiments that our method accurately reconstructs quasi-isometric surfaces from partial views under articulated and strong deformations. It naturally handles missing correspondences, non-smooth objects and is very simple to implement compared to previous methods, with only one free parameter (the neighbourhood size).",

Rather than defining affordance in terms of the geometric compatibility between body poses and 3D objects, we devise algorithms that employ physics-based simulation to infer the relevant forces/pressures acting on body parts. By observing the choices people make in videos (particularly in selecting a chair in which to sit) our system learns the comfort intervals of the forces exerted on body parts (while sitting). We account for people's preferences in terms of human utilities, which transcend comfort intervals to account also for meaningful tasks within scenes and spatiotemporal constraints in motion planning, such as for the purposes of robot task planning.",

This is important because it allows improving the training of visual classifiers when paired additional data is cheaply available, and it improves the recognition from multi-view data when there is a missing view at testing time. The problem is challenging because of the intrinsic asymmetry caused by the missing auxiliary view during testing. We account for such view during training by extending the information bottleneck method, and by combining it with risk minimization. In this way, we establish an information theoretic principle for leaning any type of visual classifier under this particular setting. We use this principle to design a large-margin classifier with an efficient optimization in the primal space. We extensively compare our method with the state-of-the-art on different visual recognition datasets, and with different types of auxiliary data, and show that the proposed framework has a very promising potential.",

We describe the relevant generative model for structured-light 3D scanning and show how adaptive pattern selection can maximize information gain in an open-loop with-feedback manner. We then demonstrate how different choices of relevant variable sets (corresponding to the subproblems of locatization and mapping) lead to different criteria for pattern selection and can be computed in an online fashion. We show results for both subproblems with several pattern dictionary choices and demonstrate their usefulness for pose estimation and depth acquisition.",

In this paper we present the Inside-Outside Net (ION), an object detector that exploits information both inside and outside the region of interest. Contextual information outside the region of interest is integrated using spatial recurrent neural networks. Inside, we use skip pooling to extract information at multiple scales and levels of abstraction. Through extensive experiments we evaluate the design space and provide readers with an overview of what tricks of the trade are important. ION improves state-of-the-art on PASCAL VOC 2012 object detection from 73.9% to 77.9% mAP. On the new and more challenging MS COCO dataset, we improve state-of-the-art from 19.7% to 33.1% mAP. In the 2015 MS COCO Detection Challenge, our ION model won \"Best Student Entry\" and finished 3rd place overall. As intuition suggests, our detection results provide strong evidence that context and multi-scale representations improve small object detection.",

        "abstract": "Semantic segmentation research has recently witnessed rapid progress, but many leading methods are unable to identify object instances. In this paper, we present Multi-task Network Cascades for instance-aware semantic segmentation. Our model consists of three networks, respectively differentiating instances, estimating masks, and categorizing objects. These networks form a cascaded structure, and are designed to share their convolutional features. We develop an algorithm for the nontrivial end-to-end training of this causal, cascaded structure. Our solution is a clean, single-step training framework and can be generalized to cascades that have more stages. We demonstrate state-of-the-art instance-aware semantic segmentation accuracy on PASCAL VOC. Meanwhile, our method takes only 360ms testing an image using VGG-16, which is two orders of magnitude faster than previous systems for this challenging problem. As a by product, our method also achieves compelling object detection results which surpass the competitive Fast/Faster R-CNN systems.  The method described in this paper is the foundation of our submissions to the MS COCO 2015 segmentation competition, where we won the 1st place.",

We build on recent work [Zhang et al., ICCV15] that trained a convolutional neural net to predict instance labeling in local image patches, extracted exhaustively in a stride from an image.  A simple Markov random field model using several heuristics was then proposed in [Zhang et al., ICCV15] to derive a globally consistent instance labeling of the image. In this paper, we formulate the global labeling problem with a novel densely connected Markov random field  and show how to encode various intuitive potentials in a way that is amenable to  efficient mean field inference [Krahenbuhl et al., NIPS11]. Our potentials encode the compatibility between the global labeling and the patch-level predictions, contrast-sensitive smoothness as well as the fact that separate regions form different instances. Our experiments on the challenging KITTI benchmark [Geiger et al., CVPR12] demonstrate that our method achieves a significant performance boost over the baseline [Zhang et al., ICCV15].",

Our method does not require manual pixel-level annotation for training, and relies instead on readily-available object detectors or visual object tracking only. Given object bounding boxes at input, we cast video segmentation as a weakly-supervised learning problem. Our proposed objective combines (a) a discriminative clustering term for background segmentation, (b) a spectral clustering one for grouping pixels of same object instances, and (c) linear constraints enabling instance-level segmentation. We propose a convex relaxation of this problem and solve it efficiently using the Frank-Wolfe algorithm.

        "abstract": "An increasing number of computer vision tasks can be tackled with deep features, which are the intermediate outputs of a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network. Despite the astonishing performance, deep features extracted from low-level neurons are still below satisfaction, arguably because they cannot access the spatial context contained in the higher layers. In this paper, we present InterActive, a novel algorithm which computes the activeness of neurons and network connections. Activeness is propagated through a neural network in a top-down manner, carrying high-level context and improving the descriptive power of low-level and mid-level neurons. Visualization indicates that neuron activeness can be interpreted as spatial-weighted neuron responses. We achieve state-of-the-art classification performance on a wide range of image datasets.",

        "abstract": "Interactive image segmentation is an important problem in computer vision with many applications including image editing, object recognition and image retrieval. Most existing interactive segmentation methods only operate on color images. Until recently, very few works have been proposed to leverage depth information from low-cost sensors to improve interactive segmentation. While these methods achieve better results than color-based methods, they are still limited in either using depth as an additional color channel or simply combining depth with color in a linear way. We propose a novel interactive segmentation algorithm which can incorporate multiple feature cues like color, depth, and normals in an unified graph cut framework to leverage these cues more effectively. A key contribution of our method is that it automatically selects a single cue to be used at each pixel, based on the intuition that only one cue is necessary to determine the segmentation label locally.  This is achieved by optimizing over both segmentation labels and cue labels, using terms designed to decide where both the segmentation and label cues should change. Our algorithm thus produces not only the segmentation mask but also a cue label map that indicates where each cue contributes to the final result. Extensive experiments on five large scale RGBD datasets show that our proposed algorithm performs significantly better than both other color-based and RGBD based algorithms in reducing the amount of user inputs as well as increasing segmentation accuracy.",

We propose a new approach to study image representations by inverting them with an up-convolutional neural network. We apply the method to shallow representations (HOG, SIFT, LBP), as well as to deep networks. For shallow representations our approach provides significantly better reconstructions than existing methods, revealing that there is surprisingly rich information contained in these features. Inverting a deep network trained on ImageNet provides several insights into the properties of the feature representation learned by the network. Most strikingly, the colors and the rough contours of an image can be reconstructed from activations in higher network layers and even from the predicted class probabilities.",

We show that Iso-NRSfM is solvable from the warps (the inter-image geometric transformations).   We propose a new theoretical framework based on Riemmanian manifolds to represent the unknown 3D surfaces, as embeddings of the camera's retinal planes.   This allows us to use the manifolds' metric tensor and Christoffel Symbol fields, which we prove are related across images by simple rules depending only on the warps.   This forms a set of important theoretical results.   Using the infinitesimal planarity formulation, it then allows us to derive a system of two quartics in two variables for each image pair.   The sum-of-squares of these polynomials is independent of the number of images and can be solved globally, forming a well-posed problem for N >= 3 images, whose solution directly leads to the surface's normal field.   The proposed method outperforms existing work in terms of accuracy and computation cost on synthetic and real datasets.",

While incorporating structure into the model should improve prediction quality, doing so is challenging - manually specifying the form of structural constraints may be impractical and inference often becomes intractable even if structural constraints are given. We sidestep this problem by reducing structured prediction to a sequence of unconstrained prediction problems and demonstrate that this approach is capable of automatically discovering priors on shape, contiguity of region predictions and smoothness of region contours from data without any a priori specification. On the instance segmentation task, this method outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving a mean AP^r of 63.6% at 50% overlap and 43.3% at 70% overlap.",

In this work, we exploit the connection between these two categories of methods, and propose a joint learning framework to unify SIR and CIR using convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, our deep architecture contains one shared sub-network together with two sub-networks that extract the SIRs of given images and the CIRs of given image pairs, respectively. The SIR sub-network is required to be computed once for each image (in both the probe and gallery sets), and the depth of the CIR sub-network is required to be minimal to reduce computational burden. Therefore, the two types of representation can be jointly optimized for pursuing better matching accuracy with moderate computational cost. Furthermore, the representations learned with pairwise comparison and triplet comparison objectives can be combined to improve matching performance. Experiments on the CUHK03, CUHK01 and VIPeR datasets show that the proposed method can achieve favorable accuracy while compared with state-of-the-arts.",

Unlike existing approaches which usually assume the silhouettes are provided, we consider more practical scenarios and generate the silhouettes for multiple views on the fly. To obtain a set of accurate silhouettes, precise camera poses are required to propagate segmentation cues across views. To perform better localization, accurate silhouettes are needed to constrain camera poses. Therefore the two problems are intertwined with each other and require a joint treatment. Facilitated by the available depth, we introduce a simple but effective silhouette consistency energy term that binds traditional appearance-based multiview segmentation cost and RGB-D frame-to-frame matching cost together. Optimization of the problem w.r.t. binary segmentation masks and camera poses naturally fits in the graph cut minimization framework and the Gauss-Newton non-linear least-squares method respectively. Experiments show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-arts performance on both tasks of image segmentation and camera localization.",

        "abstract": "Matching between two sets of objects is typically approached by finding the object pairs that collectively maximize the joint matching score. In this paper, we argue that this single solution does not necessarily lead to the optimal matching accuracy and that general one-to-one assignment problems can be improved by considering multiple hypotheses before computing the final similarity measure. To that end, we propose to utilize the marginal distributions for each entity. Previously, this idea has been neglected mainly because exact marginalization is intractable due to a combinatorial number of all possible matching permutations. Here, we propose a generic approach to efficiently approximate the marginal distributions by exploiting the m-best solutions of the original problem. This approach not only improves the matching solution, but also provides more accurate ranking of the results, because of the extra information included in the marginal distribution. We validate our claim on two distinct objectives: (i) person re-identification and temporal matching modelled as an integer linear program, and (ii) feature point matching using a quadratic cost function. Our experiments confirm that marginalization indeed leads to superior performance compared to the single (nearly) optimal solution, yielding state-of-the-art results in both applications on standard benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "We propose a new technique to jointly recover cosegmentation and dense per-pixel correspondence in two images. Our method parameterizes the correspondence field using piecewise similarity transformations and recovers a mapping between the estimated common \"foreground\" regions in the two images allowing them to be precisely aligned. Our formulation is based on a hierarchical Markov random field model with segmentation and transformation labels. The hierarchical structure uses nested image regions to constrain inference across multiple scales. Unlike prior hierarchical methods which assume that the structure is given, our proposed iterative technique dynamically recovers the structure as a variable along with the labeling. This joint inference is performed in an energy minimization framework using iterated graph cuts. We evaluate our method on a new dataset of 400 image pairs with manually obtained ground truth, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods designed specifically for either cosegmentation or correspondence estimation.",

        "abstract": "Cascade has been widely used in face detection, where classifier with low computation cost can be firstly used to shrink most of the background while keeping the recall. The cascade in detection is popularized by seminal Viola-Jones framework and then widely used in other pipelines, such as DPM and CNN. However, to our best knowledge, most of the previous detection methods use cascade in a greedy manner, where previous stages in cascade are fixed when training a new stage. So optimizations of different CNNs are isolated. In this paper, we propose joint training to achieve end-to-end optimization for CNN cascade. We show that the back propagation algorithm used in training CNN can be naturally used in training CNN cascade. We present how jointly training can be conducted on naive CNN cascade and more sophisticated region proposal network (RPN) and fast R-CNN. Experiments on face detection benchmarks verify the advantages of the joint training.",

That is, in order to align two sequences, a methodology that (non)-rigidly aligns the images is first applied, followed by temporal alignment of the obtained aligned images. In this paper, we propose the first, to the best of our knowledge, methodology that can jointly spatio-temporally align two sequences, which display highly deformable texture-varying objects. We show that by treating the problems of deformable spatial and temporal alignment jointly, we achieve better results than considering the problems independent. Furthermore, we show that deformable spatio-temporal alignment of faces can be performed in an unsupervised manner (i.e., without employing face trackers or building person-specific deformable models).",

In our framework, successive operations in a clustering algorithm are expressed as steps in a recurrent process, stacked on top of representations output by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). During training, image clusters and representations are updated jointly: image clustering is conducted in the forward pass, while representation learning in the backward pass. Our key idea behind this framework is that good representations are beneficial to image clustering and clustering results provide supervisory signals to representation learning. By integrating two processes into a single model with a unified weighted triplet loss function and optimizing it end-to-end, we can obtain not only more powerful representations, but also more precise image clusters. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on image clustering across a variety of image datasets. Moreover, the learned representations generalize well when transferred to other tasks.",

        "abstract": "Automatically describing video content with natural language is a fundamental challenge of computer vision. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which models sequence dynamics, has attracted increasing attention on visual interpretation. However, most existing approaches generate a word locally with the given previous words and the visual content, while the relationship between sentence semantics and visual content is not holistically exploited. As a result, the generated sentences may be contextually correct but the semantics (e.g., subjects, verbs or objects) are not true.  This paper presents a novel unified framework, named Long Short-Term Memory with visual-semantic Embedding (LSTM-E), which can simultaneously explore the learning of LSTM and visual-semantic embedding. The former aims to locally maximize the probability of generating the next word given previous words and visual content, while the latter is to create a visual-semantic embedding space for enforcing the relationship between the semantics of the entire sentence and visual content. The experiments on YouTube2Text dataset show that our proposed LSTM-E achieves to-date the best published performance in generating natural sentences: 45.3% and 31.0% in terms of BLEU@4 and METEOR, respectively. Superior performances are also reported on two movie description datasets (M-VAD and MPII-MD). In addition, we demonstrate that LSTM-E outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in predicting Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) triplets.",

Reliable surface normals reconstructed from multi-view correspondence serve as training data for a convolutional neural network (CNN), which predicts continuous normal vectors from raw image patches. By training from known points in the same image,  the prediction is specifically tailored to the materials and lighting conditions of the particular scene, as well as to the precise camera viewpoint. It is therefore a lot easier to learn than generic single-view normal estimation. The estimated normal maps, together with the known depth values  from MVS, are integrated to dense depth maps, which in turn are fused into a 3D model. Experiments on the DTU dataset show that our method delivers 3D reconstructions  with the same accuracy as MVS, but with significantly higher completeness.",

There are two major methods used to approximate the kernel function: the Nystrom method and the random features method.

In this paper, we propose a method that has good generalization performance without high-complexity postprocessing via empirical orthogonal decomposition using the probability distribution estimated from training data. We provide a bound for the approximation error of the proposed method. Our experiments show that the proposed method is better than the random features method and comparable with the Nystrom method in terms of the approximation error and classification accuracy.

However, SSC applies only to vector data in Euclidean space. As such, there is still no satisfactory approach to solve  subspace clustering by self-expressive principle for symmetric positive definite(SPD) matrices which is very useful in computer vision. In this paper, by embedding the SPD matrices into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), a kernel subspace clustering method is constructed on the SPD manifold through an appropriate Log-Euclidean kernel, termed as kernel sparse subspace clustering on the SPD Riemannian manifold  (KSSCR). By exploiting the intrinsic Riemannian Geometry within data, KSSCR can effectively characterize the geodesic distance between SPD matrices to uncover the underlying subspace structure. Experimental results on several famous database demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better clustering results than the state-of-the-art approaches.",

In contrast to prior appearance and graph alignment based matching methods which have been applied among two similar static images, the proposed method finds correspondences between two dynamic kinematic structures of heterogeneous objects in videos. Our main contributions can be summarised as follows: (i) casting the kinematic structure correspondence problem into a hypergraph matching problem, incorporating multi-order similarities with normalising weights, (ii) a structural topology similarity measure by a new topology constrained subgraph isomorphism aggregation, (iii) a kinematic correlation measure between pairwise nodes, and (iv) a combinatorial local motion similarity measure using geodesic distance on the Riemannian manifold. We demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our method through a number of experiments on complex articulated synthetic and real data.",

Our first contribution is a novel weakly supervised learning method that models the video event (pain, expression etc.) as a sequence of automatically mined, discriminative sub-events (eg. neutral face, raising brows, contracting lips). The proposed model is inspired by the recent works on Multiple Instance Learning and latent SVM/HCRF- it extends such frameworks to model the ordinal or temporal aspect in the videos, approximately. We show consistent improvements over relevant competitive baselines on four challenging and publicly available video based facial analysis datasets for prediction of expression, clinical pain and intent in dyadic conversations. In combination with complimentary features, we report state-of-the-art results on these datasets.",

        "abstract": "Patch-based image synthesis has been enriched with global optimization on the image pyramid. Successively, the gradient-based synthesis has improved structural coherence and details. However, the gradient operator is directional and inconsistent and requires computing multiple operators. It also introduces a significantly heavy computational burden to solve the Poisson equation that often accompanies artifacts in non-integrable gradient fields. In this paper, we propose a patch-based synthesis using a Laplacian pyramid to improve searching correspondence with enhanced awareness of edge structures. Contrary to the gradient operators, the Laplacian pyramid has the advantage of being isotropic in detecting changes to provide more consistent performance in decomposing the base structure and the detailed localization. Furthermore, it does not require heavy computation as it employs approximation by the differences of Gaussians. We examine the potentials of the Laplacian pyramid for enhanced edge-aware correspondence search. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Laplacian-based approach over the state-of-the-art patch-based image synthesis methods.",

Our approach scales up the standard bootstrapping procedure by using a hierarchical decomposition of an image collection which reflects the statistical regularity of the detector's responses.  Based on that decomposition, our procedure uses a Monte Carlo Tree Search to prioritize the sampling toward sub-families of images which have been observed to be rich in false positives, while maintaining a fraction of the sampling toward unexplored sub-families of images. The resulting procedure increases substantially the proportion of false positive samples among the visited ones compared to a naive uniform sampling.  We apply experimentally this new procedure to face detection with a collection of 100,000 background images and to pedestrian detection with 32,000 images. We show that for two standard detectors, the proposed strategy cuts the number of images to visit by half to obtain the same amount of false positives and the same final performance.",

        "abstract": "Deep CNN-based object detection systems have achieved remarkable success on several large-scale object detection benchmarks. However, training such detectors requires a large number of labeled bounding boxes, which are more difficult to obtain than image-level annotations. Previous work addresses this issue by transforming image-level classifiers into object detectors. This is done by modeling the differences between the two on categories with both image-level and bounding box annotations, and transferring this information to convert classifiers to detectors for categories without bounding box annotations. We improve this previous work by incorporating knowledge about object similarities from visual and semantic domains during the transfer process. The intuition behind our proposed method is that visually and semantically similar categories should exhibit more common transferable properties than dissimilar categories, e.g. a better detector would result by transforming the differences between a dog classifier and a dog detector onto the cat class, than would by transforming from the violin class. Experimental results on the challenging ILSVRC2013 detection dataset demonstrate that each of our proposed object similarity based knowledge transfer methods outperforms the baseline methods. We found strong evidence that visual similarity and semantic relatedness are complementary for the task, and when combined notably improve detection, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance in a semi-supervised setting.",

Recently, there have been a few attempts to solve this problem, but still more research is needed to achieve highly accurate results. In this paper, we propose a face alignment method for large-pose face images, by combining the powerful cascaded CNN regressor method and 3DMM. We formulate the face alignment as a 3DMM fitting problem, where the camera projection matrix and 3D shape parameters are estimated by a cascade of CNN-based regressors. The dense 3D shape allows us to design pose-invariant appearance features for effective CNN learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on the challenging databases (AFLW and AFW), with comparison to the state of the art.",

        "abstract": "Visual location recognition is the task of determining the place depicted in a query image from a given database of geo-tagged images. Location recognition is often cast as an image retrieval problem and recent research has almost exclusively focused on improving the chance that a relevant database image is ranked high enough after retrieval. The implicit assumption is that the number of inliers found by spatial verification can be used to distinguish between a related and an unrelated database photo with high precision. In this paper, we show that this assumption does not hold for large datasets due to the appearance of geometric bursts, i.e., sets of visual elements appearing in similar geometric configurations in unrelated database photos. We propose algorithms for detecting and handling geometric bursts. Although conceptually simple, using the proposed weighting schemes dramatically improves the recall that can be achieved when high precision is required compared to the standard re-ranking based on the inlier count. Our approach is easy to implement and can easily be integrated into existing location recognition systems",

        "abstract": "We propose an adaptive multi-resolution formulation of semantic 3D reconstruction. Given a set of images of a scene, semantic 3D reconstruction aims to densely reconstruct both the 3D shape of the scene and a segmentation into semantic object classes. Jointly reasoning about shape and class allows one to take into account class-specific shape priors (e.g., building walls should be smooth and vertical, and vice versa smooth, vertical surfaces are likely to be building walls), leading to improved reconstruction results. So far, semantic 3D reconstruction methods have been limited to small scenes and low resolution, because of their large memory footprint and computational cost. To scale them up to large scenes, we propose a hierarchical scheme which refines the reconstruction only in regions that are likely to contain a surface, exploiting the fact that both high spatial resolution and high numerical precision are only required in those regions. Our scheme amounts to solving a sequence of convex optimizations while progressively removing constraints, in such a way that the energy, in each iteration, is the tightest possible approximation of the underlying energy at full resolution. In our experiments the method saves up to 98% memory and 95% computation time, without any loss of accuracy.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel latent embedding model for learning a compatibility function between image and class embeddings, in the context of zero-shot classification. The proposed method augments the state-of-the-art bilinear compatibility model by incorporating latent variables. Instead of learning a single bilinear map, it learns a collection of maps with the selection, of which map to use, being a latent variable for the current image-class pair. We train the model with a ranking based objective function which penalizes incorrect rankings of the true class for a given image. We empirically demonstrate that our model improves the state-of-the-art for various class embeddings consistently on three challenging publicly available datasets for the zero-shot setting. Moreover, our method leads to visually highly interpretable results with clear clusters of different fine-grained object properties that correspond to different latent variable maps.",

        "abstract": "While considerable progresses have been made on face recognition, age-invariant face recognition (AIFR) still remains a major challenge in real world applications of face recognition systems. The major difficulty of AIFR arises from the fact that the facial appearance is subject to significant intra-personal changes caused by the aging process over time. In order to address this problem, we propose a novel deep face recognition framework to learn the age-invariant deep face features through a carefully designed CNN model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to show the effectiveness of deep CNNs in advancing the state-of-the-art of AIFR. Extensive experiments are conducted on several public domain face aging datasets (MORPH Album2, FGNET, and CACD-VS) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model over the state-of-the-art. We also verify the excellent generalization of our new model on the famous LFW dataset.",

        "abstract": "A major goal of imaging studies such as the (ongoing) Human Connectome Project (HCP) is to characterize the structural network map of the human brain and identify its associations with covariates such as genotype, risk factors, and so on that correspond to an individual. But the set of image derived measures and the set of covariates are both large, so we must first estimate a 'parsimonious' set of relations between the measurements. For instance, a Gaussian graphical model will show conditional independences between the random variables, which can then be used to setup specific hypothesis based analyses downstream. But most such data involve a large list of 'latent' variables that remain unobserved, yet affect the 'observed' variables sustantially. Accounting for such latent variables falls outside the scope of standard inverse covariance matrix estimation, and is tackled via highly specialized optimization methods. This paper offers a unique harmonic analysis view of this problem. By casting the estimation of the precision matrix in terms of a composition of low-frequency latent variables and high-frequency sparse terms, we show how the problem can be formulated using a new wavelet-type expansion in non-Euclidean spaces. Our formalization poses the estimation problem entirely in the frequency space and shows how it can be solved by a simple sub-gradient scheme (involving a single variable). We provide a compelling set of scientific results on   500 scans from the recently released HCP data where our algorithm recovers highly interpretable and sparse conditional dependencies between brain connectivity pathways and well-known covariates.",

Unlike other image labeling problems such as image segmentation where each pixel needs to be assigned a single label, layered decomposition requires us to assign multiple labels to pixels. We propose a novel \"Occlusion-CRF\" model that allows for the integration of sophisticated priors to regularize the solution space and enables the automatic inference of the layer decomposition. We use a generalization of the Fusion Move algorithm to perform Maximum a Posterior (MAP) inference on the model that can handle the large label sets needed to represent multiple surface assignments to each pixel. We have evaluated the proposed model and the inference algorithm on many RGBD images of cluttered indoor scenes. Our experiments show that not only is our model able to explain occlusions but it also enables automatic inpainting of occluded/invisible surfaces.",

        "abstract": "Dense 3D shape correspondence is an important problem in computer vision and computer graphics. Recently, the local shape descriptor based 3D shape correspondence approaches have been widely studied, where the local shape descriptor is a real-valued vector to characterize the geometrical structure of the shape. Different from these real-valued local shape descriptors, in this paper, we propose to learn a novel binary spectral shape descriptor with the deep neural network for 3D shape correspondence. The binary spectral shape descriptor can require less storage space and enable fast matching. First, based on the eigenvectors of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, we construct a neural network to form a nonlinear spectral representation to characterize the shape. Then, for the defined positive and negative points on the shapes, we train the constructed neural network by minimizing the errors between the outputs and their corresponding binary descriptors, minimizing the variations of the outputs of the positive points and maximizing the variations of the outputs of the negative points, simultaneously. Finally, we binarize the output of the neural network to form the binary spectral shape descriptor for shape correspondence. The proposed binary spectral shape descriptor is evaluated on the  SCAPE and TOSCA 3D shape datasets for shape correspondence. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed binary shape descriptor for the shape correspondence task.",

Our goal is to automate functional understanding of large spaces by leveraging activity demonstrations recorded from an ego-centric viewpoint. The method we describe enables functionality estimation in both large scenes where people have behaved, as well as novel scenes where no behaviors are available. Our method learns and predicts \"Action Maps\", which encode the ability for a user to perform activities at various locations. With the usage of an egocentric camera to observe demonstrations, our method scales with the size of the scene without the need for mounting multiple static surveillance cameras, and is well-suited to the task of observing activities up-close. We demonstrate that by capturing appearance-based attributes of the environment and associating these attributes with activity demonstrations, our mathematical framework allows for the prediction of Action Maps in new environments. Additionally, we take a preliminary look at the breadth of applicability of Action Maps by demonstrating a proof-of-concept application in which they are used in concert with activity detections to perform localization.",

Conventionally, when training a Recurrent Neural Network, specifically a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model, the training loss only considers classification error. However, we argue that the detection score of the correct activity category or the detection score margin between the correct and incorrect categories should be monotonically non-decreasing as the model observes more of the activity. We design novel ranking losses that directly penalize the model on violation of such monotonicities, which are used together with classification loss in training of LSTM models. Evaluation on ActivityNet shows significant benefits of the proposed ranking losses in both activity detection and early detection tasks.",

In this paper, we investigate how to learn cross-modal scene representations that transfer across modalities. To study this problem, we introduce a new cross-modal scene dataset. While convolutional neural networks can categorize cross-modal scenes well, they also learn an intermediate representation not aligned across modalities, which is undesirable for cross-modal transfer applications. We present methods to regularize cross-modal convolutional neural networks so that they have a shared representation that is agnostic of the modality. Our experiments suggest that our scene representation can help transfer representations across modalities for retrieval. Moreover, our visualizations suggest that units emerge in the shared representation that tend to activate on consistent concepts independently of the modality.",

        "abstract": "Attributes possess appealing properties and benefit many computer vision problems, such as object recognition, learning with humans in the loop, and  image retrieval. Whereas the existing work mainly pursues utilizing attributes for various computer vision problems, we contend that the most basic problem---how to accurately and robustly detect attributes from images---has been left under explored. Especially, the existing work rarely explicitly tackles the need that attribute detectors should generalize well across different categories, including those previously unseen. Noting that this is analogous to the objective of multi-source domain generalization, if we treat each category as a domain, we provide a novel perspective to attribute detection and propose to gear the techniques in multi-source domain generalization  for the purpose of learning cross-category generalizable attribute detectors. We validate our understanding and approach with extensive experiments on four challenging datasets and three different problems.",

Unlike most existing binary descriptors which were designed with random projections or linear hash functions, we develop a deep neural network to learn binary descriptors in a unsupervised manner. We enforce three criterions on binary codes which are learned at the top layer of our network: 1) minimal loss quantization, 2) evenly distributed codes and 3) uncorrelated bits. Then, we learn the parameters of the networks with a back-propagation technique. Experimental results on three different visual analysis tasks including image matching, image retrieval, and object recognition clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "While domain adaptation (DA) aims to associate the learning tasks across data domains, heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA) particularly deals with learning from cross-domain data which are of different types of features. In other words, for HDA, data from source and target domains are observed in separate feature spaces and thus exhibit distinct distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel learning algorithm of Cross-Domain Landmark Selection (CDLS) for solving the above task. With the goal of deriving a domain-invariant feature subspace for HDA, our CDLS is able to identify representative cross-domain data, including the unlabeled ones in the target domain, for performing adaptation. In addition, the adaptation capabilities of such cross-domain landmarks can be determined accordingly. This is the reason why our CDLS is able to achieve promising HDA performance when comparing to state-of-the-art HDA methods. We conduct classification experiments using data across different features, domains, and modalities. The effectiveness of our proposed method can be successfully verified.",

In this work, we present a pipeline for learning deep feature representations from multiple domains with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). When training a CNN with data from all the domains, some neurons learn representations shared across several domains, while some others are effective only for a specific one. Based on this important observation, we propose a Domain Guided Dropout algorithm to improve the feature learning procedure. Experiments show the effectiveness of our pipeline and the proposed algorithm.

While this technique was previously proposed as a means for regularizing training, we find that it actually builds a generic localizable deep representation that exposes the implicit attention of CNNs on image. Despite the apparent simplicity of global average pooling, we are able to achieve 37.1% top-5 error for object localization on ILSVRC 2014 without training on any bounding box annotation. We demonstrate that our network is able to localize the discriminative image regions on a variety of tasks despite not being trained for them.",

        "abstract": "Data in vision domain often exhibit highly-skewed class distribution, i.e., most data belong to a few majority classes, while the minority classes only contain a scarce amount of instances. To mitigate this issue, contemporary classification methods based on deep convolutional neural network (CNN) typically follow classic strategies such as class re-sampling or cost-sensitive training. In this paper, we conduct extensive and systematic experiments to validate the effectiveness of these classic schemes for representation learning on class-imbalanced data. We further demonstrate that more discriminative deep representation can be learned by enforcing a deep network to maintain both inter-cluster and inter-class margins. This tighter constraint effectively reduces the class imbalance inherent in the local data neighborhood. We show that the margins can be easily deployed in standard deep learning framework through quintuplet instance sampling and the associated triple-header hinge loss. The representation learned by our approach, when combined with a simple k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm, shows significant improvements over existing methods on both high- and low-level vision classification tasks that exhibit imbalanced class distribution.",

In these formulations the current best complement to visual features are attributes: manually-encoded vectors describing shared characteristics among categories. Despite good performance, attributes have limitations: (1) finer-grained recognition requires commensurately more attributes, and (2) attributes do not provide a natural language interface. We propose to overcome these limitations by training neural language models from scratch; i.e. without pre-training and only consuming words and characters. Our proposed models train end-to-end to align with the fine-grained and category-specific content of images. Natural language provides a flexible and compact way of encoding only the salient visual aspects for distinguishing categories. By training on raw text, our model can do inference on raw text as well, providing humans a familiar mode both for annotation and retrieval. Our model achieves strong performance on zero-shot text-based image retrieval and significantly outperforms the attribute-based state-of-the-art for zero-shot classification on the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200-2011 dataset.",

        "abstract": "Discriminative deep learning approaches have shown impressive results for problems where human-labeled ground truth is plentiful, but what about tasks where labels are difficult or impossible to obtain? This paper tackles one such problem: establishing dense visual correspondence across different object instances. For this task, although we do not know what the ground-truth is, we know it should be consistent across instances of that category. We exploit this consistency as a supervisory signal to train a convolutional neural network to predict cross-instance correspondences between pairs of images depicting objects of the same category. For each pair of training images we find an appropriate 3D CAD model and render two synthetic views to link in with the pair, establishing a correspondence flow 4-cycle. We use ground-truth synthetic-to-synthetic correspondences, provided by the rendering engine, to train a ConvNet to predict synthetic-to-real, real-to-real and real-to-synthetic correspondences that are cycle-consistent with the ground-truth. At test time, no CAD models are required. We demonstrate that our end-to-end trained ConvNet supervised by cycle-consistency outperforms state-of-the-art pairwise matching methods in correspondence-related tasks.",

Or if we want to learn about human (inter-)actions in images, can we benefit from videos or abstract illustrations that show these actions? A common aspect of these settings is the availability of additional or privileged data that can be exploited at training time and that will not be available and not of interest at test time. We seek to generalize the learning with privileged information (LUPI) framework, which requires additional information to be defined per image, to the setting where additional information is a data collection about the task of interest. Our framework minimises the distribution mismatch between errors made in images and in privileged data. The proposed method is tested on four publicly available datasets: Image+ClipArt, Image+3Dobject, and Image+Video. Experimental results reveal that our new LUPI paradigm naturally addresses the cross-dataset learning.",

        "abstract": "Recent innovations in training deep convolutional neural network (ConvNet) models have motivated the design of new methods to automatically learn local image descriptors. The latest deep ConvNets proposed for this task consist of a siamese network that is trained by penalising misclassification of pairs of local image patches. Current results from machine learning show that replacing this siamese by a triplet network can improve the classification accuracy in several problems, but this has yet to be demonstrated for local image descriptor learning. Moreover, current siamese and triplet networks have been trained with stochastic gradient descent that computes the gradient from individual pairs or triplets of local image patches, which can make them prone to overfitting. In this paper, we first propose the use of triplet networks for the problem of local image descriptor learning. Furthermore, we also propose the use of a global loss that minimises the overall classification error of all patches present in the training set, which can improve the generalisation capability of the model. Using the UBC benchmark dataset for comparing local image descriptors, we show that the triplet network produces a more accurate embedding than the siamese network in terms of the UBC dataset errors. Moreover, we also demonstrate that a combination of the triplet and global losses produces the best embedding in the field, using this triplet network. Finally, we also show that the use of the central-surround siamese network trained with the global loss produces the best result of the field on the UBC dataset.",

Our algorithm pretrains a CNN using a large set of videos with tracking ground-truths to obtain a generic target representation. Our network is composed of shared layers and multiple branches of domain-specific layers, where domains correspond to individual training sequences and each branch is responsible for binary classification to identify target in each domain. We train each domain in the network iteratively to obtain generic target representations in the shared layers. When tracking a target in a new sequence, we construct a new network by combining the shared layers in the pretrained CNN with a new binary classification layer, which is updated online. Online tracking is performed by evaluating the candidate windows randomly sampled around the previous target state. The proposed algorithm illustrates outstanding performance in existing tracking benchmarks.",

The conventional approach for training predictors does not directly consider temporal consistency, and often produces undesirable jitter. Although post-hoc smoothing (e.g., via a Kalman filter) can mitigate this issue to some degree, it is not ideal due to overly stringent modeling assumptions (e.g., Gaussian noise). We propose a recurrent decision tree framework that can directly incorporate temporal consistency into a data-driven predictor, as well as a learning algorithm that can efficiently learn such temporally smooth models. Our approach does not require any post-processing, making online smooth predictions much easier to generate when the noise model is unknown. We apply our approach to sports broadcasting: given noisy player detections, we learn where the camera should look based on human demonstrations. Our experiments exhibit significant improvements over conventional baselines and showcase the practicality of our approach.",

        "abstract": "It is a challenging problem to accurately estimate gazes from low-resolution eye images that do not provide fine and detailed features for eyes. Existing methods attempt to establish the mapping between the visual appearance space to the gaze space. Different from the direct regression approach, the reconstruction-based approach represents appearance and gaze via local linear reconstruction in their own spaces. A common treatment is to use the same local reconstruction in the two spaces, i.e., the reconstruction weights in the appearance space are transferred to the gaze space for gaze reconstruction. However, this questionable treatment is taken for granted but has never been justified, leading to significant errors in gaze estimation. This paper is focused on the study of this fundamental issue. It shows that the distance metric in the appearance space needs to be adjusted, before the same reconstruction can be used. A novel method is proposed to learn the metric, such that the affinity structure of the appearance space under this new metric is as close as possible to the affinity structure of the gaze space under the normal Euclidean metric. Furthermore, the local affinity structure invariance is utilized to further regularize the solution to the reconstruction weights, so as to obtain a more robust and accurate solution. Effectiveness of the proposed method is validated and demonstrated through extensive experiments on different subjects.",

The conventional deep supervision utilizes the general ground-truth to guide intermediate predictions. Instead, we build hierarchical supervisory signals with additional relaxed labels to consider the diversities in deep neural networks. We begin by capturing the relaxed labels from simple detectors (e.g. Canny).Then we merge them with the general ground-truth to generate the RDS. Finally we employ the RDS to supervise the edge network following a coarse-to-fine paradigm. These relaxed labels can be seen as some false positives that are difficult to be classified. We consider these false positives in the supervision, and are able to achieve high performance for better edge detection. We compensate for the lack of training images by capturing coarse edge annotations from a large dataset of image segmentations to pretrain the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the well-known BSDS500 dataset (ODS F-score of .792) and obtains superior cross-dataset generalization results on NYUD dataset.",

In this paper, we will generalize the parametrization and in particular derive a gradient descent algorithm so the filter parameters can be learned from data. This derivation allows to learn high dimensional linear filters that operate in sparsely populated feature spaces. We build on the permutohedral lattice construction for efficient filtering. The ability to learn more general forms of high-dimensional filters can be used in several diverse applications. First, we demonstrate the use in applications where single filter applications are desired for runtime reasons. Further, we show how this algorithm can be used to learn the pairwise potentials in densely connected conditional random fields and apply these to different image segmentation tasks. Finally, we introduce layers of bilateral filters in CNN and propose bilateral neural networks for the use of high-dimensional sparse data. This view provides new ways to encode model structure into network architectures. A diverse set of experiments empirically validates the usage of general forms of filters.",

        "abstract": "Images of scenes have various objects as well as abundant attributes, and diverse levels of visual categorization are possible. A natural image could be assigned with fine-grained labels that describe major components, coarse-grained labels that depict high level abstraction or a set of labels that reveal attributes. Such categorization at different concept layers can be modeled with label graphs encoding label information. In this paper, we exploit this rich information with a state-of-art deep learning framework, and propose a generic structured model that leverages diverse label relations to improve image classification performance. Our approach employs a novel stacked label prediction neural network, capturing both inter-level and intra-level label semantics. We evaluate our method on benchmark image datasets, and empirical results illustrate the efficacy of our model.",

        "abstract": "Perceiving meaningful activities in a long video sequence is a challenging problem due to ambiguous definition of `meaningfulness' as well as clutters in the scene. We approach this problem by learning a generative model for regular motion patterns (termed as regularity) using multiple sources with very limited supervision. Specifically, we propose two methods that are built upon the autoencoders for their ability to work with little to no supervision. We first leverage the conventional handcrafted spatio-temporal local features and learn a fully connected autoencoder on them. Second, we build a fully convolutional feed-forward autoencoder to learn both the local features and the classifiers as an end-to-end learning framework. Our model can capture the regularities from multiple datasets. We evaluate our methods in both qualitative and quantitative ways - showing the learned regularity of videos in various aspects and demonstrating competitive performance on anomaly detection datasets as an application.",

Contrary to existing weakly-supervised approaches, our algorithm exploits auxiliary segmentation an- notations available for different categories to guide segmentations on images with only image-level class labels. To make segmentation knowledge transferrable across categories, we design a decoupled encoder-decoder architecture with attention model. In this architecture, the model generates spatial highlights of each category presented in images using an attention model, and subsequently per- forms binary segmentation for each highlighted region using decoder. Combining attention model, the decoder trained with segmentation annotations in different categories boosts accuracy of weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. The proposed algorithm demonstrates substantially improved performance compared to the state-of-the- art weakly-supervised techniques in PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset when our model is trained with the annotations in 60 exclusive categories in Microsoft COCO dataset.",

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown promising performance on this task.  Due to the large variability of shapes,  accurate recognition relies on good estimates of model uncertainty, ignored in traditional training of DNNs, typically learned via  stochastic optimization. This paper leverages recent advances in stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) to learn weight uncertainty in DNNs. It yields principled Bayesian interpretations for the commonly used Dropout/DropConnect techniques and incorporates them into the SG-MCMC framework. Extensive experiments on 2D & 3D shape datasets and various DNN models demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over stochastic optimization. Our approach yields higher recognition accuracy when used in conjunction with Dropout and Batch-Normalization.",

        "abstract": "Most existing person re-identification (re-id) methods focus on learning the optimal distance metrics across camera views. Typically a person's appearance is represented using features of thousands of dimensions, whilst only hundreds of training samples are available due to the difficulties in collecting matched training images. With the number of training samples much smaller than the feature dimension, the existing methods thus face the classic small sample size (SSS) problem and have to resort to dimensionality reduction techniques and/or matrix regularisation, which lead to loss of discriminative power. In this work, we propose to overcome the SSS problem in re-id distance metric learning by matching people in a discriminative  null space of the training data. In this null space, images of the same person are collapsed into a single point thus minimising the within-class scatter to the extreme and maximising the relative between-class separation simultaneously. Importantly, it has a fixed dimension, a closed-form solution and is very efficient to compute. Extensive experiments carried out on five person re-identification benchmarks including VIPeR, PRID2011, CUHK01, CUHK03 and Market1501 show that such a simple approach beats the state-of-the-art alternatives, often by a big margin.",

Our method improves feature point matching upon the state-of-the art and can be used in conjunction with any existing rotation sensitive descriptors.  To avoid the tedious and almost impossible task of finding a target orientation to learn, we propose to use Siamese networks which implicitly find the optimal orientations during training. We also propose a new type of activation function for Neural Networks that generalizes the popular ReLU, maxout, and PReLU activation functions.  This novel activation performs better for our task.  We validate the effectiveness of our method extensively with four existing datasets, including two non-planar datasets, as well as our own dataset.

However, most existing methods generate the object candidates independently of each other. In this paper, we present an approach to co-generating object proposals in multiple images, thus leveraging the collective power of multiple object candidates. In particular, we introduce a deep structured network that jointly predicts the objectness scores and the bounding box locations of multiple object candidates. Our deep structured network consists of a fully-connected Conditional Random Field built on top of a set of deep Convolutional Neural Networks, which learn features to model both the individual object candidate and the similarity between multiple candidates. To train our deep structured network, we develop an end-to-end learning algorithm that, by unrolling the CRF inference procedure, lets us backpropagate the loss gradient throughout the entire structured network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two benchmark datasets, showing significant improvement over state-of-the-art object proposal algorithms.",

        "abstract": "We interact everyday with tiny objects such as the door handle of a car or the light switch in a room. These little landmarks are barely visible and hard to localize in images. We describe a method to find such landmarks by finding a sequence of latent landmarks, each with a prediction model. Each latent landmark predicts the next in sequence, and the last localizes the target landmark. For example, to find the door handle of a car, our method learns to start with a latent landmark near the wheel, as it is globally distinctive; subsequent latent landmarks use the context from the earlier ones to get closer to the target. Our method is supervised solely by the location of the little landmark and displays strong performance on more difficult variants of established tasks and on two new tasks.",

        "abstract": "Image matching is a fundamental problem in Computer Vision. In the context of feature-based matching, SIFT and its variants have long excelled in a wide array of applications. However, for ultra-wide baselines, as in the case of aerial images captured under large camera rotations, the appearance variation goes beyond the reach of SIFT and RANSAC. In this paper we propose a data-driven, deep learning-based approach that sidesteps local correspondence by framing the problem as a classification task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that local correspondences can still be useful. To do so we incorporate an attention mechanism to produce a set of probable matches, which allows us to further increase performance. We train our models on a dataset of urban aerial imagery consisting of `same' and `different' pairs, collected for this purpose, and characterize the problem via a human study with annotations from Amazon Mechanical Turk. We demonstrate that our models outperform the state-of-the-art on ultra-wide baseline matching and approach human accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Despite the recent advances in automatically describing image contents, their applications have been mostly limited to image caption datasets containing natural images (e.g., Flickr 30k, MSCOCO). In this paper, we present a deep learning model to efficiently detect a disease from an image and annotate its contexts (e.g., location, severity and the affected organs). We employ a publicly available radiology dataset of chest x-rays and their reports, and use its image annotations to mine disease names to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In doing so, we adopt various regularization techniques to circumvent the large normal-vs-diseased cases bias. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are then trained to describe the contexts of a detected disease, based on the deep CNN features. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach to use the weights of the already trained pair of CNN/RNN on the domain-specific image/text dataset, to infer the joint image/text contexts for composite image labeling. Significantly improved image annotation results are demonstrated using the recurrent neural cascade model by taking the joint image/text contexts into account.",

Our framework is formulated on top of a least squares SVM (LS-SVM) classifier, which is simple and fast in both training and testing, and achieves competitive performance in practice. The regularization parameters in LS-SVM is estimated automatically without grid search and cross-validation by maximizing evidence, which is a useful measure to select the best performing CNN out of multiple candidates for transfer learning; the evidence is optimized efficiently by employing Aitken's delta-squared process, which accelerates convergence of fixed point update. The proposed Bayesian evidence framework also provides a good solution to identify the best ensemble of heterogeneous CNNs through a greedy algorithm. Our Bayesian evidence framework for transfer learning is tested on 12 visual recognition datasets and illustrates the state-of-the-art performance consistently in terms of prediction accuracy and modeling efficiency.",

Given a baseline algorithm for measuring the similarity of two face sets, the meta-algorithm introduced in this paper seeks to leverage the structure of the data corpus to make the best use of the available baseline. In particular, we show how partial transitivity of inter-personal similarity can be exploited to improve the retrieval of particularly challenging sets which poorly match the query under the baseline measure. We: (i) describe the use of proxy sets as a means of computing the similarity between two sets, (ii) introduce transitivity meta-features based on the similarity of salient modes of appearance variation between sets, (iii) show how quasi-transitivity can be learnt from such features without any labelling or manual intervention, and (iv) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology through experiments on the notoriously challenging YouTube database.",

        "abstract": "Classifying a visual concept merely from its associated online textual source, such as a Wikipedia article, is an attractive research topic in zero-shot learning because it alleviates the burden of manually collecting semantic attributes. Several recent works have pursued this approach by exploring various ways of connecting the visual and text domains. This paper revisits this idea by stepping further to consider one important factor: the textual representation is usually too noisy for the zero-shot learning application. This consideration motivates us to design a simple-but-effective zero-shot learning method capable of suppressing noise in the text. More specifically, we propose an l_2,1-norm based objective function which can simultaneously suppress the noisy signal in the text and learn a function to match the text document and visual features. We also develop an optimization algorithm to efficiently solve the resulting problem. By conducting experiments on two large datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the competing methods which rely on online information sources but without explicit noise suppression. We further make an in-depth analysis of the proposed method and provide insight as to what kind of information in documents is useful for zero-shot learning.",

Commonly, using Principal Components Analysis a low-dimensional subspace of the high-dimensional shape space is determined. However, the resulting factors (the most dominant eigenvectors of the covariance matrix) have global support, i.e. changing the coefficient of a single factor deforms the entire shape. Based on matrix factorisation with sparsity and graph-based regularisation terms, we present a method to obtain deformation factors with local support. The benefits include better flexibility and interpretability as well as the possibility of interactively deforming shapes locally. We demonstrate that for brain shapes our method outperforms the state of the art in local support models with respect to generalisation and sparse reconstruction, whereas for body shapes our method gives more realistic deformations.",

Our model, given a search region, aims at returning the bounding box of an object of interest inside this region. To accomplish its goal, it relies on assigning conditional probabilities to each row and column of this region, where these probabilities provide useful information regarding the location of the boundaries of the object inside the search region and allow the accurate inference of the object bounding box under a simple probabilistic framework.   For implementing our localization model, we make use of a convolutional neural network architecture that is properly adapted for this task, called LocNet. We show experimentally that LocNet achieves a very significant improvement on the mAP for high IoU thresholds on PASCAL VOC2007 test set and that it can be very easily coupled with recent state-of-the-art object detection systems, helping them to boost their performance. Finally, we demonstrate that our detection approach can achieve high detection accuracy even when it is given as input a set of sliding windows, thus proving that it is independent of box proposal methods.",

        "abstract": "Recent work in salient object detection has considered the incorporation of depth cues from RGB-D images. In most cases, depth contrast is used as the main feature. However, areas of high contrast in background regions cause false positives for such methods, as the background frequently contains regions that are highly variable in depth. Here, we propose a novel RGB-D saliency feature. Local Background Enclosure (LBE) captures the spread of angular directions which are background with respect to the candidate region and the object that it is part of. We show that our feature improves over state-of-the-art RGB-D saliency approaches as well as RGB methods on the RGBD1000 and NJUDS2000 datasets.",

        "abstract": "Label Distribution Learning (LDL) is a general learning framework which includes both single label and multi-label learning as its special cases. One of the main assumptions made in traditional LDL algorithms is the derivation of the parametric model as the maximum entropy model. While it is a reasonable assumption without additional information, there is no particular evidence supporting it in the problem of LDL. Alternatively, using a general LDL model family to approximate this parametric model can avoid the potential influence of the specific model. In order to learn this general model family, this paper uses a method called Logistic Boosting Regression (LogitBoost) which can be seen as an additive weighted function regression from the statistical viewpoint. For each step, we can fit individual weighted regression function (base learner) to realize the optimization gradually. The base learners are chosen as weighted regression tree and vector tree, which constitute two algorithms named LDLogitBoost and AOSO-LDLogitBoost in this paper. Experiments on facial expression recognition, crowd opinion prediction on movies and apparent age estimation show that LDLogitBoost and AOSO-LDLogitBoost can achieve better performance than traditional LDL algorithms as well as other LogitBoost algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Modeling the face aging process is a challenging task due to large and non-linear variations present in different stages of face development. This paper presents a deep model approach for face age progression that can efficiently capture the non-linear aging process and automatically synthesize a series of age-progressed faces in various age ranges. In this approach, we first decompose the long-term age progress into a sequence of short-term changes and model it as a face sequence. The Temporal Deep Restricted Boltzmann Machines based age progression model together with the prototype faces are then constructed to learn the aging transformation between faces in the sequence. In addition, to enhance the wrinkles of faces in the later age ranges, the wrinkle models are further constructed using Restricted Boltzmann Machines to capture their variations in different facial regions. The geometry constraints are also taken into account in the last step for more consistent age-progressed results. The proposed approach is evaluated using various face aging databases, i.e. FG-NET, Cross-Age Celebrity Dataset (CACD) and MORPH, and  our collected large-scale aging database named AginG Faces in the Wild (AGFW). In addition, when ground-truth age is not available for input image, our proposed system is able to automatically estimate the age of the input face before aging process is employed.",

This increase in the number of classes comes along with increased ambiguity between the class labels, raising the question if top-1 error is the right performance measure. In this paper, we provide an extensive comparison and evaluation of established multiclass methods comparing their top-k performance both from a practical as well as from a theoretical perspective. Moreover, we introduce novel top-k loss functions as modifications of the softmax and the multiclass SVM losses and provide efficient optimization schemes for them. In the experiments, we compare on various datasets all of the proposed and established methods for top-k error optimization. An interesting insight of this paper is that the softmax loss yields competitive top-k performance for all k simultaneously. For a specific top-k error, our new top- k losses lead typically to further improvements while being faster to train than the softmax.",

        "abstract": "Segmenting images of low quality or with missing data is a challenging problem. Integrating statistical prior information about the shapes to be segmented can improve the segmentation results significantly. Most shape-based segmentation algorithms optimize an energy functional and find a point estimate for the object to be segmented. This does not provide a measure of the degree of confidence in that result, neither does it provide a picture of other probable solutions based on the data and the priors. With a statistical view, addressing these issues would involve the problem of characterizing the posterior densities of the shapes of the objects to be segmented. For such characterization, we propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling-based image segmentation algorithm that uses statistical shape priors. In addition to better characterization of the statistical structure of the problem, such an approach would also have the potential to address issues with getting stuck at local optima, suffered by existing shape-based segmentation methods. Our approach is able to characterize the posterior probability density in the space of shapes through its samples, and to return multiple solutions, potentially from different modes of a multimodal probability density, which would be encountered, e.g., in segmenting objects from multiple shape classes. We present promising results on a variety of data sets. We also provide an extension for segmenting shapes of objects with parts that can go through independent shape variations. This extension involves the use of local shape priors on object parts and provides robustness to limitations in shape training data size.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning has received much attention as of the most powerful approaches for multimodal representation learning in recent years. An ideal model for multimodal data can reason about missing modalities using the available ones, and usually provides more information when multiple modalities are being considered. All the previous deep models contain separate modality-specific networks and find a shared representation on top of those networks. Therefore, they only consider high level interactions between modalities to find a joint representation for them. In this paper, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework (MDL-CW) that exploits the cross weights between representation of modalities, and try to gradually learn interactions of the modalities in a deep network manner (from low to high level interactions). Moreover, we theoretically show that considering these interactions provide more intra-modality information, and introduce a multi-stage pre-training method that is based on the properties of multi-modal data. In the proposed framework, as opposed to the existing deep methods for multi-modal data, we try to reconstruct the representation of each modality at a given level, with representation of other modalities in the previous layer. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art information retrieval methods for both image and text queries on the PASCAL-sentence and SUN-Attribute databases.",

        "abstract": "While there has been increasing interest in the task of describing video with natural language, current computer vision algorithms are still severely limited in terms of the variability and complexity of the videos and their associated language that they can recognize.  This is in part due to the simplicity of current benchmarks, which mostly focus on specific fine-grained domains with limited videos and simple descriptions. While researchers have provided several benchmark datasets for image captioning, we are not aware of any large-scale video description dataset with comprehensive categories yet diverse video content.  In this paper we present MSR-VTT (standing for \"ABC-Video to Text\") which is a new large-scale video benchmark for video understanding, especially the emerging task of translating video to text.  This is achieved by collecting 257 popular queries from a commercial video search engine, with 118 videos for each query. In its current version, MSR-VTT provides 10K web video clips with 38.7 hours and 200K clip-sentence pairs in total, covering the most comprehensive categories and diverse visual content, and representing the largest dataset in terms of sentence and vocabulary. Each clip is annotated with about 20 natural sentences by 1,327 AMT workers.  We present a detailed analysis of MSR-VTT in comparison to a complete set of existing datasets, together with a summarization of different state-of-the-art video-to-text approaches.  We also provide an extensive evaluation of these approaches on this dataset, showing that the hybrid Recurrent Neural Network-based approach, which combines single-frame and motion representations with soft-attention pooling strategy, yields the best generalization capability on MSR-VTT.",

Today, ToF sensors use phase-based sampling, where the phase delay between emitted and received, high-frequency signals encodes distance. This paper examines an alternative ToF architecture, inspired by micron-scale, microscopic interferometry, that relies only on frequency sampling: we refer to our proposed macroscopic technique as Frequency-Domain Time of Flight (FD-ToF).

        "abstract": "Superpixels are perceptually meaningful atomic regions that can effectively capture image features. Among various methods for computing uniform superpixels, simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) is popular due to its simplicity and high performance. In this paper, we extend SLIC to compute content-sensitive superpixels, i.e., small superpixels in content-dense regions (e.g., with high intensity or color variation) and large superpixels in content-sparse regions. Rather than the conventional SLIC method that clusters pixels in R5, we map the image I to a 2-dimensional manifold M in R5, whose area elements are a good measure of the content density in I. We propose an efficient method to compute restricted centroidal Voronoi tessellation (RCVT) --- a uniform tessellation --- on M, which induces the content-sensitive superpixels in I. Unlike other algorithms that characterize content-sensitivity by geodesic distances, manifold SLIC tackles the problem by measuring areas of Voronoi cells on M, which can be computed at a very low cost. As a result, it runs 10 times faster than the state-of-the-art content-sensitive superpixels algorithm. We evaluate manifold SLIC and seven representative methods on the BSDS500 benchmark and observe that our method outperforms the existing methods.",

We introduce a skip-network model built on the pre-trained Oxford VGG convolutional neural network for surface normal prediction.  Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the NYUv2 RGB-D dataset for surface normal prediction, and recovers fine object detail compared to previous methods.  Furthermore, we develop a two-stream network over the input image and predicted surface normals that jointly learns pose and style for CAD model retrieval.  When using the predicted surface normals, our two-stream network matches prior work using surface normals computed from RGB-D images on the task of pose prediction, and achieves state of the art when using RGB-D input.  Finally, our two-stream network allows us to retrieve CAD models that better match the style and pose of a depicted object compared with baseline approaches.",

This makes it inapplicable to realistic problems with many variables and labels, due to excessive memory requirement.

        "abstract": "Over the past ten years, metric learning allowed the improvement of the numerous machine learning approaches that manipulate distances or similarities. In this field, local metric learning has been shown to be very efficient, especially to take into account non linearities in the data and better capture the peculiarities of the application of interest. However, it is well known that local metric learning (i) can entail overfitting and (ii) face difficulties to compare two instances that are assigned to two different local models. In this paper, we address these two issues by introducing a novel metric learning algorithm that linearly combines local models (C2LM). Starting from a partition of the space in regions and a model (a score function) for each region, C2LM defines a metric between points as a weighted combination of the models. A weight vector is learned for each pair of regions, and a spatial regularization ensures that the weight vectors evolve smoothly and that nearby models are favored in the combination. The proposed approach has the particularity of working in a regression setting, of working implicitly at different scales, and of being generic enough so that it is applicable to similarities and distances. We prove theoretical guarantees of the approach using the framework of algorithmic robustness. We carry out experiments with datasets using both distances (perceptual color distances, using Mahalanobis-like distances) and similarities (semantic word similarities, using bilinear forms), showing that C2LM consistently improves regression accuracy even in the case where the amount of training data is small.",

Using higher order clique potentials to model complex dependencies between pixels improves the performance but the current state of the art inference algorithms fail to scale for larger clique sizes. We adapt a well known Min Norm Point algorithm from mathematical optimization literature to exploit the sum of submodular structure found in the MRF-MAP formulation. Unlike some contemporary methods, we do not make any assumptions (other than submodularity) on the type of the clique potentials. Current state of the art inference algorithms for general submodular function takes many hours for problems with clique size 16, and fail to scale beyond. On the other hand, our algorithm is highly efficient and can perform optimal inference in few seconds even on clique size an order of magnitude larger. The proposed algorithm can even scale to clique sizes of many hundreds, unlocking the usage of really large size cliques for MRF-MAP inference problems in computer vision. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by experimenting on synthetic as well as real datasets.",

        "abstract": "In computer vision, many problems can be formulated as finding a low rank approximation of a given measurement matrix. Ideally, if all elements of the measurement matrix are available, this is easily solved in the L2-norm using factorization. However, in practice this is rarely the case. Lately, this problem has been addressed using different approaches, one is to replace the rank term by the convex nuclear norm, another is to derive the convex envelope of the rank term plus a data term. In the latter case, matrices are divided into sub-matrices and the envelope is computed for each sub-block individually. In this paper a new convex envelope is derived which takes all sub-matrices into account simultaneously. This leads to a simpler formulation, using only one parameter, for applications where one seeks low rank approximations of multiple matrices with the same rank. We show in this paper how our general framework can be used for manifold denoising of several images at once, as well as just denoising one image. We get comparable results to other well-known methods and our framework can also be used for other applications such as linear shape models.",

        "abstract": "Recognizing an action from a sequence of 3D skeletal poses is a challenging task. First, different actors may perform the same action in various performing styles. Second, the estimated poses are sometimes inaccurate due to sensory noises. These challenges can cause large variations between instances of the same class. Third, the datasets are usually small, with only a few actors performing few repetitions of each action. Hence training complex classifiers risks over-fitting the data. We address this task by mining a set of key-pose-motifs for each action class. A key-pose-motif contains a set of ordered  poses or  action units(a short sequence of poses), which are required to be close but not necessarily adjacent in the action sequences. The representation is robust to style variations and outlier poses. The key-pose-motifs are represented in terms of a dictionary using soft-quantization (probabilities) to deal with inaccuracies caused by quantization. We propose an efficient algorithm to mine key-pose-motifs taking into account these probabilities. We classify a sequence by matching it to the motifs of each class and select the class that maximizes the matching score. This simple classifier obtains state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets and outperforms a deep network approach.",

        "abstract": "Fine-grained classification involves distinguishing between similar sub-categories based on subtle differences in highly localized regions; therefore, accurate localization of discriminative regions remains a major challenge.  We describe a patch-based framework to address this problem. We introduce triplets of patches with geometric constraints to improve the accuracy of patch localization, and automatically mine discriminative geometrically-constrained triplets for classification. The resulting approach only requires object bounding boxes. Its effectiveness is demonstrated using four publicly available fine-grained datasets, on which it outperforms or obtains comparable results to the state-of-the-art in classification.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of mirror surface reconstruction, and a solution based on observing the reflections of a moving reference plane on the mirror surface is proposed. Unlike previous approaches which require tedious work to calibrate the camera, our method can recover both the camera intrinsics and extrinsics together with the mirror surface from reflections of the reference plane under at least three unknown distinct poses. Our previous work has demonstrated that 3D poses of the reference plane can be registered in a common coordinate system using reflection correspondences established across images. This leads to a bunch of registered 3D lines formed from the reflection correspondences. Given these lines, we first derive an analytical solution to recover the camera projection matrix through estimating the line projection matrix. We then optimize the camera projection matrix by minimizing reprojection errors computed based on a cross-ratio formulation. The mirror surface is finally reconstructed based on the optimized cross-ratio constraint. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data are presented, which demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our method.",

This paper proposes a mixture of bilateral-projection probabilistic principal component analysis model (mixB2DPPCA) on 2D data. With multi-components in the mixture, this model can be seen as a `soft' cluster algorithm and has capability of modeling data with complex structures. A Bayesian inference scheme has been proposed based on the variational EM (Expectation-Maximization) approach for learning model parameters.   Experiments on some publicly available databases show that the performance of mixB2DPPCA has been largely improved, resulting in more accurate reconstruction errors and recognition rates than the existing PCA-based algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Cascaded regression has recently become the method of choice for solving non-linear least squares problems such as deformable image alignment. Given a sizeable training set, cascaded regression learns a set of generic rules that are sequentially applied to minimise the least squares problem.  Despite the success of cascaded regression for problems such as face alignment and head pose estimation, there are several shortcomings arising in the strategies proposed thus far.  Specifically, (a) the regressors are learnt independently, (b) the descent directions may cancel one another out and  (c) handcrafted features (e.g., HoGs, SIFT etc.) are mainly used to drive the cascade, which may be sub-optimal for the task at hand. In this paper, we propose a combined and jointly trained convolutional recurrent neural network architecture that allows the training of an end-to-end to system that attempts to alleviate the aforementioned drawbacks. The recurrent module facilitates the joint optimisation of the regressors by assuming the cascades form a nonlinear dynamical system, in effect fully utilising the information between all cascade levels by introducing a memory unit that shares information across all levels. The convolutional module allows the network to extract features that are specialised for the task at hand and are experimentally shown to outperform hand-crafted features. We show that the application of the proposed architecture for the problem of face alignment results in a strong improvement over the current state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "While convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been excellent for object recognition, the greater spatial variability in scene images typically meant that the standard full-image CNN features are suboptimal for scene classification. In this paper, we investigate a framework allowing greater spatial flexibility, in which the Fisher vector (FV) encoded distribution of local CNN features, obtained from a multitude of region proposals per image, is considered instead. The CNN features are computed from an augmented pixel-wise representation comprising multiple modalities of RGB, HHA and surface normals, as extracted from RGB-D data. More significantly, we make two postulates: (1) component sparsity --- that only a small variety of region proposals and their corresponding FV GMM components contribute to scene discriminability, and (2) modal non-sparsity --- within these discriminative components, all modalities have important contribution. In our framework, these are implemented through regularization terms applying group lasso to GMM components and exclusive group lasso across modalities. By learning and combining regressors for both proposal-based FV features and global CNN features, we were able to achieve state-of-the-art scene classification performance on the SUNRGBD Dataset and NYU Depth Dataset V2.",

Our method first aims to generate a set of candidate class-specific object proposals, which are then run through a standard CNN pipeline to obtain high-quality object detections. The focus of this paper is on proposal generation. In particular, we propose a probabilistic model that places object candidates in 3D using a prior on ground-plane. We then score each candidate box projected to the image plane via several intuitive potentials such as semantic segmentation, contextual information, size and location priors and typical object shape. The weights in our model are trained with S-SVM. Experiments show that our object proposal generation approach significantly outperforms all monocular baselines, and achieves the best detection performance on the challenging KITTI benchmark, among the published monocular competitors.",

NRF combines random forests and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Scanning windows extracted from the image represent samples which are passed down the trees of NRF for predicting their depth. At every tree node, the sample is filtered with a CNN associated with that node. Results of the convolutional filtering are passed to left and right children nodes, i.e., corresponding CNNs, with a Bernoulli probability, until the leaves, where depth estimations are made. CNNs at every node are designed to have fewer parameters than seen in recent work, but their stacked processing along a path in the tree effectively amounts to a deeper CNN. NRF allows for parallelizable training of all \"shallow\" CNNs, and efficient enforcing of smoothness in depth estimation results. Our evaluation on the benchmark Make3D and NYUv2 datasets demonstrates that NRF outperforms the state of the art, and gracefully handles gradually decreasing training datasets.",

In this ILP, path-cut inequalities enforce the morality of lineages, i.e., the constraint that cells do not merge. To find feasible solutions of this NP-hard problem, with certified bounds to the global optimum, we define efficient separation procedures and apply these as part of a branch-and-cut algorithm. To show the effectiveness of this approach, we analyze feasible solutions for real microscopy data in terms of bounds and run-time, and by their weighted edit distance to lineage forests traced by humans.",

        "abstract": "Object detection has been a long standing problem in computer vision, and state-of-the-art approaches rely on the use of sophisticated features and/or classifiers. However, these learning-based approaches heavily depend on the quality and quantity of labeled data, and do not generalize well to extreme poses or textureless objects.   In this work, we explore the use of 3D shape models to detect objects in videos in an unsupervised manner. We call this problem Motion from Structure (MfS): given a set of point trajectories and a 3D model of the object of interest, find a subset of trajectories that correspond to the 3D model and estimate its alignment (i.e., compute the motion matrix). MfS is related to Structure from Motion (SfM) and motion segmentation problems: unlike SfM, the structure of the object is known but the correspondence between the trajectories and the object is unknown; unlike motion segmentation, the MfS problem incorporates 3D structure, providing robustness to tracking mismatches and outliers. Experiments illustrate how our MfS algorithm outperforms alternative approaches in both synthetic data and real videos extracted from YouTube.",

The dataset consists of 14,944 questions about 408 movies with high semantic diversity. The questions range from simpler \"Who\" did \"What\" to \"Whom\", to \"Why\" and \"How\" certain events occurred. Each question comes with a set of five possible answers; a correct one and four deceiving answers provided by human annotators. Our dataset is unique in that it contains multiple sources of information -- video clips, plots, subtitles, scripts, and DVS. We analyze our data through various statistics and methods. We further extend existing QA techniques to show that question-answering with such open-ended semantics is hard. We make this data set public along with an evaluation benchmark to encourage inspiring work in this challenging domain.",

        "abstract": "Scaling up visual category recognition to large numbers of classes remains challenging. A promising research direction is zero-shot learning, which does not require any training data to recognize new classes, but rather relies on some form of auxiliary information describing the new classes. Ultimately, this may allow to use textbook knowledge that humans employ to learn about new classes by transferring knowledge from classes they know well. The most successful zero-shot learning approaches currently require a particular type of auxiliary information -- namely attribute annotations performed by humans -- that is not readily available for most classes. Our goal is to circumvent this bottleneck by substituting such annotations by extracting multiple pieces of information from multiple unstructured text sources readily available on the web. To compensate for the weaker form of auxiliary information, we incorporate stronger supervision in the form of semantic part annotations on the classes from which we transfer knowledge. We achieve our goal by a joint embedding framework that maps multiple text parts as well as multiple semantic parts into a common space. Our results consistently and significantly improve on the state-of-the-art in zero-short recognition and retrieval.",

This problem is fundamentally important in many multi-label applications because it is almost impossible for human annotators to assign a complete set of labels, although their judgments are reliable. In other words, a multi-label dataset usually has properties by which (1) assigned labels are definitely positive and (2) some labels are absent but are still considered positive. Such a setting has been studied as a positive and unlabeled (PU) classification problem in a binary setting. We treat incomplete label assignment problems as a multi-label PU ranking, which is an extension of classical binary PU problems to the well-studied rank-based multi-label classification. We derive the conditions that should be satisfied to cancel the negative effects of label incompleteness. Our experimentally obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of these conditions.",

Both global and local cues are taken into account for localizing text lines in a coarse-to-fine procedure. First, a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) model is trained for predicting a salient map of text regions in a holistic manner. Then, a set of hypotheses text lines are estimated by combining the salient map and MSER components. Finally, another FCN classifier is used for predicting the centroid of each character, in order to remove the false hypotheses. The framework is general for handling texts in multiple orientations, languages and fonts.

        "abstract": "Cross-view recognition that intends to classify samples between different views is an important problem in computer vision. The large discrepancy between different even heterogenous views make this problem quite challenging. To eliminate the complex (maybe even highly nonlinear) view discrepancy for favorable cross-view recognition, we propose a multi-view deep network (MvDN), which seeks for a non-linear discriminant and view-invariant representation shared between multiple views. Specifically, our proposed MvDN network consists of two sub-networks, view-specific sub-network attempting to remove view-specific variations and the following common sub-network attempting to obtain common representation shared by all views. As the objective of MvDN network, the Fisher loss, i.e. the Rayleigh quotient objective, is calculated from the samples of all views so as to guide the learning of the whole network. As a result, the representation from the topmost layers of the MvDN network is robust to view discrepancy, and also discriminative. The experiments of face recognition across pose and face recognition across feature type on three datasets with 13 and 2 views respectively demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, especially compared to the typical linear ones.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a hierarchical composition approach for multi-view object tracking. The key idea is to adaptively exploit multiple cues in both 2D and 3D, e.g., ground occupancy consistency, appearance similarity, motion coherence etc., which are mutually complementary while tracking the humans of interests over time. While feature online selection has been extensively studied in the past literature, it remains unclear how to effectively schedule these cues for the tracking purpose especially when encountering various challenges, e.g. occlusions, conjunctions, and appearance variations. To do so, we propose a hierarchical composition model and re-formulate multi-view multi-object tracking as a problem of compositional structure optimization. We setup a set of composition criteria, each of which corresponds to one particular cue. The hierarchical composition process is pursued by exploiting different criteria, which impose constraints between a graph node and its offsprings in the hierarchy. We learn the composition criteria using MLE on annotated data and efficiently construct the hierarchical graph by an iterative greedy pursuit algorithm. In the experiments, we demonstrate superior performance of our approach on three public datasets, one of which is newly created by us to test various challenges in multi-view multi-object tracking.",

        "abstract": "Multicamera rigs are used in a large number of 3D Vision applications, such as 3D modeling, motion capture or telepresence and a robust calibration is of utmost importance in order to achieve a high accuracy results. In many practical configurations the cameras in a rig are arranged in such a way, that they can observe each other, in other words a number of epipoles correspond to the real image points. In this paper we propose a solution for the automatic recovery of the external calibration of a multicamera system by enforcing only simple geometrical constraints, arising from the epipole visibility, without using any calibration object, such as checkerboards, laser pointers or similar. Additionally, we introduce an extension of the method that handles the case of epipoles being visible in the reflection of a planar mirror, which makes the algorithm suitable for the calibration of any multicamera system, irrespective of the number of cameras and their actual mutual visibility, and furthermore we remark that it requires only one or a few images per camera and therefore features a high speed and usability. We produce an evidence of the algorithm effectiveness by presenting a wide set of tests performed on synthetic as well as real datasets and we compare the results with those obtained using a traditional LED-based algorithm. The real datasets have been captured using a multicamera Virtual Reality (VR) rig and a spherical dome configuration for 3D reconstruction.",

        "abstract": "Hashing has become an increasingly popular technique for fast nearest neighbor search in large databases. Despite its successful progress in classic point-to-point search, there are few studies regarding point-to-hyperplane search, which has strong practical capabilities of scaling up in many applications like active learning with SVMs. Existing hyperplane hashing methods enable the fast search based on the randomly generated hash codes, but still suffer from a low collision probability and thus usually require long codes for a satisfying performance. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a multilinear hyperplane hashing that generates a hash bit using multiple linear projections. Our theoretical analysis shows that as a product of an even number of random linear projections, the multilinear hash function possesses an increasing power of locality sensitivity to the hyperplane queries. To leverage its sensitivity to the angle distance, we further introduce an angular quantization based learning framework for compact multilinear hashing, which considerably boosts the search performance with less hash bits. Experiments with applications to large-scale (up to one million) active learning on two datasets demonstrate the overall superiority of the proposed approach.",

We present a well-annotated, multimodal, multidimensional spontaneous emotion corpus of 140 participants. Emotion inductions were highly varied. Data were acquired from a variety of sensors of the face that included high-resolution 3D dynamic imaging, high-resolution 2D video, and thermal (infrared) sensing, and contact physiological sensors that included electrical conductivity of the skin, respiration, blood pressure, and heart rate. Facial expression was annotated for both the occurrence and intensity of facial action units from 2D video by experts in the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). The corpus further includes derived features from 3D, 2D, and IR (infrared) sensors and baseline results for facial expression and action unit detection. The entire corpus will be made available to the research community.",

        "abstract": "Multispectral images (MSI) can help deliver more faithful representation for real scenes than the traditional image system, and enhance the performance of many computer vision tasks. In real cases, however, an MSI is always corrupted by various noises. In this paper, we propose a new tensor-based denoising approach by fully considering two intrinsic characteristics underlying an MSI, i.e., the global correlation along spectrum (GCS) and nonlocal self-similarity across space (NSS). In specific, we construct a new tensor sparsity measure, called intrinsic tensor sparsity (ITS) measure, which encodes both sparsity insights delivered by the most typical Tucker and CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) low-rank decomposition for a general tensor. Then we build a new MSI denoising model by applying the proposed ITS measure on tensors formed by non-local similar patches within the MSI. The intrinsic GCS and NSS knowledge can then be efficiently explored under the regularization of this tensor sparsity measure to finely rectify the recovery of a MSI from its corruption. A series of experiments on simulated and real MSI denoising problems show that our method outperforms all state-of-the-arts under comprehensive quantitative performance measures.",

        "abstract": "We study the problem of predicting how to recognise visual objects in novel domains with neither labelled nor unlabelled training data. Domain adaptation is now an established research area due to its value in ameliorating the issue of domain shift between train and test data. However, it is conventionally assumed that domains are discrete entities, and that at least unlabelled data is provided in testing domains. In this paper, we consider the case where domains are parametrised by a vector of continuous values (e.g., time, lighting or view angle). We aim to use such domain metadata to predict novel domains for recognition. This allows a recognition model to be pre-calibrated for a new domain in advance (e.g., future time or view angle) without waiting for data collection and re-training. We achieve this by posing the problem as one of multivariate regression on the Grassmannian, where we regress a domain's subspace (point on the Grassmannian) against an independent vector of domain parameters. We derive two novel methodologies to achieve this challenging task: a direct kernel regression, and an indirect method with better extrapolation properties. We evaluate our methods on two cross-domain visual recognition benchmarks, where they perform close to the upper bound of full data domain adaptation. This demonstrates that data is not necessary for domain adaptation if a domain can be parametrically described.",

Since a user specifies the region to be completed in one of multiview photographs casually taken in a scene, the proposed method enables us to complete the set of photographs with geometric consistency by creating or removing structures on the specified region. The proposed method incorporates photographs to estimate dense depth maps. We initially complete color as well as depth from a view, and then facilitate two stages of structure propagation and structure-guided completion. Structure propagation optimizes space topology in the scene across photographs, while structure-guide completion enhances, and completes local image structure of both depth and color in multiple photographs with structural coherence by searching nearest neighbor fields in relevant views.

        "abstract": "Recent approaches in depth-based human activity analysis achieved outstanding performance and proved the effectiveness of 3D representation for classification of action classes. Currently available depth-based and RGB+D-based action recognition benchmarks have a number of limitations, including the lack of training samples, distinct class labels, camera views and variety of subjects. In this paper we introduce a large-scale dataset for RGB+D human action recognition with more than 56 thousand video samples and 4 million frames, collected from 40 distinct subjects. Our dataset contains 60 different action classes including daily, mutual, and health-related actions. In addition, we propose a new recurrent neural network structure to model the long-term temporal correlation of the features for each body part, and utilize them for better action classification. Experimental results show the advantages of applying deep learning methods over state-of-the-art hand-crafted features on the suggested cross-subject and cross-view evaluation criteria for our dataset. The introduction of this large scale dataset will enable the community to apply, develop and adapt various data-hungry learning techniques for the task of depth-based and RGB+D-based human activity analysis.",

Natural language object retrieval differs from text-based image retrieval task as it involves spatial information about objects within the scene and global scene context. To address this issue, we propose a novel Spatial Context Recurrent ConvNet (SCRC) model as scoring function on candidate boxes for object retrieval, integrating spatial configurations and global scene-level contextual information into the network. Our model processes query text, local image descriptors, spatial configurations and global context features through a recurrent network, outputs the probability of the query text conditioned on each candidate box as a score for the box, and can transfer visual-linguistic knowledge from image captioning domain to our task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively utilizes both local and global information, outperforming previous baseline methods significantly on different datasets and scenarios, and can exploit large scale vision and language datasets for knowledge transfer.",

Matched patches in the degraded image, do not necessarily imply similarity of the underlying patches in the (unknown) high-quality image. This restricts the applicability of patch-based methods. In this paper we present a patch representation called \"Needle\", which consists of small multi-scale versions of the patch and its immediate surrounding region. While the patch at the finest image scale is severely degraded, the degradation decreases dramatically in coarser needle scales, revealing reliable information for matching. We show that the Needle is  robust to many types of image degradations, leads to matches faithful to the underlying high-quality patches, and to improvement in existing patch-based methods.",

We present the following three principal contributions. First, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that is trainable in an end-to-end manner directly for the place recognition task. The main component of this architecture, NetVLAD, is a new generalized VLAD layer, inspired by the \"Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors\" image representation commonly used in image retrieval. The layer is readily pluggable into any CNN architecture and amenable to training via backpropagation. Second, we develop a training procedure, based on a new weakly supervised ranking loss, to learn parameters of the architecture in an end-to-end manner from images depicting the same places over time downloaded from Google Street View Time Machine. Finally, we show that the proposed architecture significantly outperforms non-learnt image representations and off-the-shelf CNN descriptors on two challenging place recognition benchmarks, and improves over current state-of-the-art compact image representations on standard image retrieval benchmarks.",

We describe a procedure for constructing and learning _neural module networks_, which compose collections of jointly-trained neural \"modules\" into deep networks for question answering. Our approach decomposes questions into their linguistic substructures, and uses these structures to dynamically instantiate modular networks (with reusable components for recognizing dogs, classifying colors, etc.). The resulting compound networks are jointly trained.

Given a query object in an image, our goal is to provide a physical understanding of the object in terms of the forces acting upon it and its long term motion as response to those forces. Direct and explicit estimation of the forces and the motion of objects from a single image is extremely challenging. We define intermediate physical abstractions called Newtonian scenarios and introduce Newtonian Neural Network (N^3) that learns to map a single image to a state in a Newtonian scenario. Our experimental evaluations show that our method can reliably predict dynamics of a query object from a single image. In addition, our approach can provide physical reasoning that supports the predicted dynamics in terms of velocity and force vectors. To spur research in this direction we compiled Visual Newtonian Dynamics (VIND) dataset that includes more than 6000 videos aligned with Newtonian scenarios represented using game engines, and more than 4500 still images with their ground truth dynamics.",

        "abstract": "Recent shadow detection algorithms have shown initial success on small datasets of images from specific domains. However, shadow detection on broader image domains is still challenging due to the lack of annotated training data. This is due to the intense manual labor in annotating shadow data. In this paper we propose \"lazy annotation\", an efficient annotation method where an annotator only needs to mark the important shadow areas and some non-shadow areas. This yields data with noisy labels that are not yet useful for training a shadow detector. We address the problem of label noise by jointly learning a shadow region classifier and recovering the labels in the training set. We consider the training labels as unknowns and formulate the label recovery problem as the minimization of the sum of squared leave-one-out errors of a Least Squares SVM, which can be efficiently optimized. Experimental results show that a classifier trained with recovered labels achieves comparable performance to a classifier trained on the properly annotated data. These results suggest a feasible approach to address the task of detecting shadows in an unfamiliar domain: collecting and lazily annotating some images from the new domain for training. As will be demonstrated, this approach outperforms methods that rely on precisely annotated but less relevant datasets. Initial results suggest more general applicability.",

        "abstract": "Haze limits visibility and reduces image contrast in outdoor images. The degradation is different for every pixel and depends on the distance of the scene point from the camera. This dependency is expressed in the transmission coefficients, that control the scene attenuation and amount of haze in every pixel. Previous methods solve the single image dehazing problem using various patch-based priors. We, on the other hand, propose an algorithm based on a new, non-local prior. The algorithm relies on the assumption that colors of a haze-free image are well approximated by a few hundred distinct colors, that form tight clusters in RGB space. Our key observation is that pixels in a given cluster are often non-local, i.e., they are spread over the entire image plane and are located at different distances from the camera. In the presence of haze these varying distances translate to different transmission coefficients. Therefore, each color cluster in the clear image becomes a line in RGB space, that we term a haze-line. Using these haze-lines, our algorithm recovers both the distance map and the haze-free image. The algorithm is linear in the size of the image, deterministic and requires no training. It performs well on a wide variety of images and is competitive with other state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Aiming at automatically discovering the common objects contained in a set of relevant images and segmenting them as foreground simultaneously, object co-segmentation has become an active research topic in recent years. Although a number of approaches have been proposed to address this problem, many of them are designed with the misleading assumption, unscalable prior, or low flexibility and thus still suffer from certain limitations, which reduces their capability in the real-world scenarios. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a novel two-stage co-segmentation framework, which introduces the weak background prior to establish a globally close- loop graph to represent the common object and union background separately. Then a novel graph optimized-flexible manifold ranking algorithm is proposed to flexibly optimize the graph connection and node labels to co-segment the common objects. Experiments on three image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",

Different from previous low-level edge detection, our algorithm focuses on detecting higher-level object contours. Our network is trained end-to-end on PASCAL VOC with refined ground truth from inaccurate polygon annotations, yielding much higher precision in object contour detection than previous methods. We find that the learned model generalizes well to unseen object classes from the same supercategories on MS COCO and can match state-of-the-art edge detection on BSDS500 with fine-tuning. By combining with the multiscale combinatorial grouping algorithm, our method can generate high-quality segmented object proposals, which significantly advance the state-of-the-art on PASCAL VOC (improving average recall from 0.62 to 0.67) with a relatively small amount of candidates (1660 per image).",

For object detection, particularly in still images, the performance has been significantly increased last year thanks to powerful deep networks (e.g. GoogleNet) and detection frameworks (e.g. Regions with CNN features (R-CNN)). The lately introduced ImageNet task on object detection from video (VID) brings the object detection task into video domain, in which objects' locations at each frame are required to be annotated with bounding boxes. In this work, we introduce a complete framework for the VID task based on still-image object detection and general object tracking. Their relations and contributions in the VID task are thoroughly studied and evaluated. In addition, a temporal convolution network is proposed to incorporate temporal information to regularize the detection results and shows its effectiveness for the task.",

        "abstract": "Object skeleton is a useful cue for object detection, complementary to the object contour, as it provides a structural representation to describe the relationship among object parts. While object skeleton extraction in natural images is a very challenging problem, as it requires the extractor to be able to capture both local and global image context to determine the intrinsic scale of each skeleton pixel. Existing methods rely on per-pixel based multi-scale feature computation, which results in difficult modeling and high time consumption. In this paper, we present a fully convolutional network with multiple scale-associated side outputs to address this problem. By observing the relationship between the receptive field sizes of the sequential stages in the network and the skeleton scales they can capture, we introduce a scale-associated side output to each stage. We impose supervision to different stages by guiding the scale-associated side outputs toward groundtruth skeletons of different scales. The responses of the multiple scale-associated side outputs are then fused in a scale-specific way to localize skeleton pixels with multiple scales effectively. Our method achieves promising results on two skeleton extraction datasets, and significantly outperforms other competitors.",

However, the complex and expensive optimization limits their deployment in real-world applications. In this paper, we present a simple yet efficient dual linear SSVM (DLSSVM) algorithm to enable fast learning and execution during tracking. By analyzing the dual variables, we propose a primal classifier update formula where the learning step size is computed in closed form. This online learning method significantly improves the robustness of the proposed linear SSVM with low computational cost. Second, we approximate the intersection kernel for feature representations with an explicit feature map to further improve tracking performance. Finally, we extend the proposed DLSSVM tracker in a multiscale manner to address the \"drift\" problem. Experimental results on large benchmark datasets with 50 and 100 video sequences show that the proposed DLSSVM tracking algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

        "abstract": "Object proposals have quickly become the de-facto pre-processing step in a number of vision pipelines (for object detection, object discovery, and other tasks). Their performance is usually evaluated on partially annotated datasets. In this paper, we argue that the choice of using a partially annotated dataset for evaluation of object proposals is problematic -- as we demonstrate via a thought experiment, the evaluation protocol is 'gameable', in the sense that progress under this protocol does not necessarily correspond to a \"better\" category independent object proposal algorithm.   To alleviate this problem, we: (1) Introduce a nearly-fully annotated version of PASCAL VOC dataset, which serves as a test-bed to check if object proposal techniques are overfitting to a particular list of categories. (2) Perform an exhaustive evaluation of object proposal methods on our introduced nearly-fully annotated PASCAL dataset and perform cross-dataset generalization experiments; and (3) Introduce a diagnostic experiment to detect the bias capacity in an object proposal algorithm. This tool circumvents the need to collect a densely annotated dataset, which can be expensive and cumbersome to collect. Finally, we have released an easy-to-use toolbox which combines various publicly available implementations of object proposal algorithms which standardizes the proposal generation and evaluation so that new methods can be added and evaluated on different datasets. We hope that the results presented in the paper will motivate the community to test the category independence of various object proposal methods by carefully choosing the evaluation protocol.",

In this paper, we improve occlusion boundary detection via enhanced exploration of contextual information (e.g., local structural boundary patterns, observations from surrounding regions, and temporal context), and in doing so develop a novel approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and conditional random fields (CRFs). Experimental results demonstrate that our detector significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (e.g., improving the F-measure from 0.62 to 0.71 on the commonly used CMU benchmark).

        "abstract": "Face alignment or facial landmark detection plays an important role in many computer vision applications, e.g., face recognition, facial expression recognition, face animation, etc. However, the performance of face alignment system degenerates severely when occlusions occur. In this work, we propose a novel face alignment method, which cascades several Deep Regression networks coupled with De-corrupt Autoencoders (denoted as DRDA) to explicitly handle partial occlusion problem. Different from the previous works that can only detect occlusions and discard the occluded parts, our proposed de-corrupt autoencoder network can automatically recover the genuine appearance for the occluded parts and the recovered parts can be leveraged together with those non-occluded parts for more accurate alignment. By coupling de-corrupt autoencoders with deep regression networks, a deep alignment model robust to partial occlusions is achieved. Besides, our method can localize occluded regions rather than merely predict whether the landmarks are occluded. Experiments on two challenging occluded face datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Sparse feature (dictionary) selection is critical for various tasks in computer vision, machine learning, and pattern recognition to avoid overfitting. While extensive research efforts have been conducted on feature selection using sparsity and group sparsity, we note that there has been a lack of development on applications where there is a particular preference on diversity. That is, the selected features are expected to come from different groups or categories. This diversity preference is motivated from many real-world applications such as advertisement recommendation, privacy image classification, and design of survey.   In this paper, we proposed a general bilevel exclusive sparsity formulation to pursue the diversity by restricting the overall sparsity and the sparsity in each group. To solve the proposed formulation that is NP hard in general, a heuristic procedure is proposed. The main contributions in this paper include: 1) A linear convergence rate is established for the proposed algorithm; 2) The provided theoretical error bound improves the approaches such as L_1 norm and L_0 types methods which only use the overall sparsity and the quantitative benefits of using the diversity sparsity is provided. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to show the theoretical benefits of using the diversity sparsity; 3) Extensive empirical studies are provided to validate the proposed formulation, algorithm, and theory.",

        "abstract": "The appearance of (outdoor) scenes changes considerably with the strength of certain transient attributes, such as \"rainy\", \"dark\" or \"sunny\". Obviously, this also affects the representation of an image in feature space, e.g., as activations at a certain CNN layer, and consequently impacts scene recognition performance. In this work, we investigate the variability in these transient attributes as a rich source of information for studying how image representations change as a function of attribute strength. In particular, we leverage a recently introduced dataset with fine-grain annotations to estimate feature trajectories for a collection of transient attributes and then show how these trajectories can be transferred to new image representations. This enables us to synthesize new data along the transferred trajectories with respect to the dimensions of the space spanned by the transient attributes. Applicability of this concept is demonstrated on the problem of one-shot recognition of scene locations. We show that data synthesized via feature trajectory transfer considerably boosts recognition performance, (1) with respect to baselines and (2) in combination with state-of-the-art approaches in one-shot learning.",

In particular, the training data are large-scale weakly labeled Web images since it is difficult to acquire sufficient well-labeled data at this category scale.  In this paper, we propose a novel online learning paradigm towards this challenging task. Different from traditional N-way independent classifiers that generally fail to handle the extremely sparse and inter-related labels, our classifiers learn from continuous label embeddings discovered by collaboratively decomposing the sparse image-label matrix. Leveraging on the structure of the proposed collaborative learning formulation, we develop an efficient online algorithm that can jointly learn the label embeddings and visual classifiers. The algorithm can learn over 30,000 classes of 1,000 training images within 1 second on a standard GPU. Extensively experimental results on four benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

        "abstract": "Automatic detection and classification of dynamic hand gestures in real-world systems intended for human computer interaction is challenging as: 1) there is a large diversity in how people perform gestures, making detection and classification difficult; 2) the system must work online in order to avoid noticeable lag between performing a gesture and its classification; in fact, a negative lag (classification before the gesture is finished) is desirable, as feedback to the user can then be truly instantaneous. In this paper, we address these challenges with a recurrent three-dimensional convolutional neural network that performs simultaneous detection and classification of dynamic hand gestures from multi-modal data. We employ connectionist temporal classification to train the network to predict class labels from in-progress gestures in unsegmented input streams. In order to validate our method, we introduce a new challenging multi-modal dynamic hand gesture dataset captured with depth, color and stereo-IR sensors. On this challenging dataset, our gesture recognition system achieves an accuracy of 83.8%, outperforms competing state-of-the-art algorithms, and approaches human accuracy of 88.4%. Moreover, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on SKIG and ChaLearn2014 benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Multi-object tracking (MOT) becomes more challenging when objects of interest have similar appearances. In that case, the motion cues are particularly useful for discriminating multiple objects. However, for online 2D MOT in scenes acquired from moving cameras, observable motion cues are complicated by global camera movements and thus not always smooth or predictable. To deal with such unexpected camera motion for online 2D MOT, a structural motion constraint between objects has been utilized thanks to its robustness to camera motion. In this paper, we propose a new data association method that effectively exploits structural motion constraints in the presence of large camera motion. In addition, to further improve the robustness of data association against mis-detections and clutters, a novel event aggregation approach is developed to integrate structural constraints in assignment costs for online MOT. Experimental results on a large number of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for online 2D MOT.",

        "abstract": "A system capable of performing robust online volumetric reconstruction of indoor scenes based on input from a handheld RGB-D camera is presented. Our system is powered by a two-pass reconstruction scheme. The first pass tracks camera poses at video rate and simultaneously constructs a pose graph on-the-fly. The tracker operates in real-time, which allows the reconstruction results to be visualized during the scanning process. Live visual feedbacks makes the scanning operation fast and intuitive. Upon termination of scanning, the second pass takes place to handle loop closures and reconstruct the final model using globally refined camera trajectories. The system is online with low delay and returns a dense model of sufficient accuracy. The beauty of this system lies in its speed, accuracy, simplicity and ease of implementation when compared to previous methods. We demonstrate the performance of our system on several real-world scenes and quantitatively assess the modeling accuracy with respect to ground truth models obtained from a LIDAR scanner.",

In reality, optical flow varies across an image depending on object class. Simply put, different objects move differently. Here we exploit recent advances in static semantic scene segmentation to segment the image into objects of different types. We define different models of image motion in these regions depending on the type of object. For example, the road motion with homographies, vegetation with spatially smooth flow, and independently moving objects like cars and planes with affine+deviations. We then pose the flow estimation problem using a novel formulation of  localized layers, which addresses limitations of traditional layered models for dealing with complex scene motion. Our  semantic flow method achieves the lowest error of any published method in the KITTI-2015 flow benchmark and produces qualitatively better flow and segmentation than recent top methods on a wide range of natural videos.",

In this paper, we go one step further and show that it is feasible to compute both the epipolar geometry and the correspondences at the same time based on geometry only. We do this in a globally optimal manner. Our approach is based on an efficient branch and bound technique in combination with bipartite matching to solve the correspondence problem. We rely on several recent works to obtain good bounding functions to battle the combinatorial explosion of possible matchings. It is experimentally demonstrated that more difficult cases can be handled and that more inlier correspondences can be obtained by being less restrictive in the matching phase.",

        "abstract": "State-of-the-art subspace clustering methods are based on expressing each data point as a linear combination of other data points while regularizing the matrix of coefficients with l_1, l_2 or nuclear norms. l_1 regularization is guaranteed to give a subspace-preserving affinity (i.e., there are no connections between points from different subspaces) under broad theoretical conditions, but the clusters may not be connected. l_2 and nuclear norm regularization often improve connectivity, but give a subspace-preserving affinity only for independent subspaces. Mixed l_1, l_2 and nuclear norm regularizations offer a balance between the subspace-preserving and connectedness properties, but this comes at the cost of increased computational complexity. This paper studies the geometry of the elastic net regularizer (a mixture of the l_1 and l_2 norms) and uses it to derive a provably correct and scalable active set method for finding the optimal coefficients. Our geometric analysis also provides a theoretical justification and a geometric interpretation for the balance between the connectedness (due to l_2 regularization) and subspace-preserving (due to l_1 regularization) properties for elastic net subspace clustering. Our experiments show that the proposed active set method not only achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance, but also efficiently handles large-scale datasets.",

However, the processes of extracting features and learning a regression model are often separated and optimized independently in previous work. In this paper, we propose an End-to-End learning approach to address ordinal regression problems using deep Convolutional Neural Network, which could simultaneously conduct feature learning and regression modeling. In particular, an ordinal regression problem is transformed into a series of binary classification sub-problems. And we propose a multiple output CNN learning algorithm to collectively solve these classification sub-problems, so that the correlation between these tasks could be explored. In addition, we publish an Asian Face Age Dataset (AFAD) containing more than 160K facial images with precise age ground-truths, which is the largest public age dataset to date. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address ordinal regression problems by using CNN, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both the MORPH and AFAD datasets.",

By superposing the foreground and background features, we build the object recurrence model, the background model, and the primary object model. We develop an iterative scheme to refine each model evolutionary using the information in the other models. Finally, using the evolved primary object model, we select candidate proposals and locate the bounding box of a primary object by merging the proposals selectively.

        "abstract": "Pointwise label and Pairwise label are both widely used in computer vision tasks. For example, supervised image classification and annotation approaches use pointwise label, while attribute-based image relative learning often adopts pairwise labels. These two types of labels are often considered independently and most existing efforts utilize them separately. However, pointwise labels in image classification and tag annotation are inherently related to the pairwise labels. For example, an image labeled with \"coast\" and annotated with \"beach, sea, sand, sky\" is more likely to have a higher ranking score in terms of the attribute \"open\"; while \"men shoes\" ranked highly on the attribute \"formal\" are likely to be annotated with \"leather, lace up\" than \"buckle, fabric\".  The existence of potential relations between pointwise labels and pairwise labels motivates us to fuse them together for jointly addressing related vision tasks. In particular, we provide a principled way to capture the relations between class labels, tags and attributes; and propose a novel framework PPP(Pointwise and Pairwise image label Prediction),  which is based on overlapped group structure extracted from the pointwise-pairwise-label bipartite graph. With experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance on three vision tasks compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

In this paper we present a novel regression-based SR algorithm that benefits from an extended knowledge of the structure of both manifolds. We propose a transform that collapses the 16 variations induced from the dihedral group of transforms (i.e. rotations, vertical and horizontal reflections) and antipodality (i.e. diametrically opposed points in the unitary sphere) into a single primitive. The key idea of our transform is to study the different dihedral elements as a group of symmetries within the high-dimensional manifold. We obtain the respective set of mirror-symmetry axes by means of a frequency analysis of the dihedral elements, and we use them to collapse the redundant variability through a modified symmetry distance. The experimental validation of our algorithm shows the effectiveness of our approach, which obtains competitive quality with a dictionary of as little as 32 atoms (reducing other methods' dictionaries by at least a factor of 32) and further pushing the state-of-the-art with a 1024 atoms dictionary.",

However, most existing solutions to multi-view recognition typically adopt hand-crafted, model-based geometric methods, which do not readily embrace recent trends in deep learning. We propose to bring Convolutional Neural Networks to generic multi-view recognition, by decomposing an image sequence into a set of image pairs, classifying each pair independently, and then learning an object classifier by weighting the contribution of each pair. This allows for recognition over arbitrary camera trajectories, without requiring explicit training over the potentially infinite number of camera paths and lengths. Building these pairwise relationships then naturally extends to the next-best-view problem in an active recognition framework. To achieve this, we train a second Convolutional Neural Network to map directly from an observed image to next viewpoint. Finally, we incorporate this into a trajectory optimisation task, whereby the best recognition confidence is sought for a given trajectory length. We present state-of-the-art results in both guided and unguided multi-view recognition on the ModelNet dataset, and show how our method can be used with depth images, greyscale images, or both.",

In PLRC, we first define a new concept of the unrelated subspace and introduce two strategies to constitute the unrelated subspace. In order to increase the information of maximizing the query set and the unrelated image set, we introduce a combination metric for two new classifiers based on two constitution strategies of the unrelated subspace. Extensive experiments on six well-known databases prove that the performance of PLRC is better than that of DLRC and several state-of-the-art classifiers for different vision recognition tasks: cluster-based face recognition, video-based face recognition, object recognition and action recognition.",

        "abstract": "Feature matching is a key problem in computer vision and pattern recognition. One way to encode the essential interdependence between potential feature matches is to cast the problem as inference in a graphical model, though recently alternatives such as spectral methods, or approaches based on the convex-concave procedure have achieved the state-of-the-art. Here we revisit the use of graphical models for feature matching, and propose a belief propagation scheme which exhibits the following advantages: (1) we explicitly enforce one-to-one matching constraints; (2) we offer a tighter relaxation of the original cost function than previous graphical-model-based approaches; and (3) our sub-problems decompose into max-weight bipartite matching, which can be solved efficiently, leading to orders-of-magnitude reductions in execution time. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm produces results superior to those of the current state-of-the-art.",

Current approaches either use a moving camera that captures multiple images of a scene, which are then stitched together to form the final panorama, or use multiple cameras that are synchronized. A moving camera limits the solution to static scenes, while multi-camera solutions require dedicated calibrated setups. Our approach improves upon the existing solutions in two significant ways: It solves the problem using a single camera, thus minimizing the calibration problem and providing us the ability to convert any digital camera into a panoramic stereo capture device. It captures all the light rays required for stereo panoramas in a single frame using a compact custom designed mirror, thus making the design practical to manufacture and easier to use. We analyze several properties of the design as well as present panoramic stereo and depth estimation results.",

We instead treat motion blur as a useful signal that allows to compute the motion of objects from a single image. Drawing on the success of joint segmentation and parametric motion models in the context of optical flow estimation, we propose a parametric object motion model combined with a segmentation mask to exploit localized, non-uniform motion blur. Our parametric image formation model is differentiable w.r.t. the motion parameters, which enables us to generalize marginal-likelihood techniques from uniform blind deblurring to localized, non-uniform blur. A two-stage pipeline, first in derivative space and then in image space, allows to estimate both parametric object motion as well as a motion segmentation from a single image alone. Our experiments demonstrate its ability to cope with very challenging cases of object motion blur.",

In this paper, we propose a novel Part-Stacked CNN architecture that explicitly explains the fine-grained recognition process by modeling subtle differences from object parts. Based on manually-labeled strong part annotations, the proposed architecture consists of a fully convolutional network to locate multiple object parts and a two-stream classification network that encodes object-level and part-level cues simultaneously. By adopting a set of sharing strategies between the computation of multiple object parts, the proposed architecture is very efficient running at 20 frames/sec during inference. Experimental results on the CUB-200-2011 dataset reveal the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, from multiple perspectives of classification accuracy, model interpretability, and efficiency. Being able to provide interpretable recognition results in realtime, the proposed method is believed to be effective in practical applications.",

        "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are state-of-the-art models for many image classification tasks. However, to recognize cancer subtypes automatically, training a CNN on gigapixel resolution Whole Slide Tissue Images (WSI) is currently computationally impossible. The differentiation of cancer subtypes is based on cellular-level visual features observed on image patch scale. Therefore, we argue that in this situation, training a patch-level classifier on image patches will perform better than or similar to an image-level classifier. The challenge becomes how to intelligently combine patch-level classification results and model the fact that not all patches will be discriminative. We propose to train a decision fusion model to aggregate patch-level predictions given by patch-level CNNs, which to the best of our knowledge has not been shown before. Furthermore, we formulate a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) based method that automatically locates discriminative patches robustly by utilizing the spatial relationships of patches. We apply our method to the classification of glioma and non-small-cell lung carcinoma cases into subtypes. The classification accuracy of our method is similar to the inter-observer agreement between pathologists. Although it is impossible to train CNNs on WSIs, we experimentally demonstrate using a comparable non-cancer dataset of smaller images that a patch-based CNN can outperform an image-based CNN.",

Towards this goal, we present a novel Markov random field model based on ray potentials in which assumptions about large 3D surface patches such as planarity or Manhattan world constraints can be efficiently encoded as probabilistic priors. We further derive an inference algorithm that reasons jointly about voxels, pixels and image segments, and estimates marginal distributions of appearance, occupancy, depth, normals and planarity. Key to tractable inference is a novel hybrid representation that spans both voxel and pixel space and that integrates non-local information from 2D image segmentations in a principled way. We compare our non-local prior to commonly employed local smoothness assumptions and a variety of state-of-the-art volumetric reconstruction baselines on challenging outdoor scenes with textureless and reflective surfaces. Our experiments indicate that regularizing over larger distances has the potential to resolve ambiguities where local regularizers fail.",

        "abstract": "The discrimination and simplicity of features are very important for effective and efficient pedestrian detection. However, most state-of-the-art methods are unable to achieve good tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. Inspired by some simple inherent attributes of pedestrians (i.e., appearance constancy and shape symmetry), we propose two new types of non-neighboring features (NNF): side-inner difference features (SIDF) and symmetrical similarity features (SSF). SIDF can characterize the difference between the background and pedestrian and the difference between the pedestrian contour and its inner part. SSF can capture the symmetrical similarity of pedestrian shape. However, it's difficult for neighboring features to have such above characterization abilities. Finally, we propose to combine both non-neighboring and neighboring features for pedestrian detection. It's found that nonneighboring features can further decrease the average miss rate by 4.44%. Experimental results on INRIA and Caltech pedestrian datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Compared to the state-ofthe- art methods without using CNN, our method achieves the best detection performance on Caltech, outperforming the second best method (i.e., Checkboards) by 1.63%.",

In this paper, we present a novel multi-channel parts-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model under the triplet framework for person re-identification. Specifically, the proposed CNN model consists of multiple channels to jointly learn both the global full body and local body-parts features of the input persons. The CNN model is trained by an improved triplet loss function that serves to pull the instances of the same person closer, and at the same time push the instances belonging to different persons farther from each other in the learned feature space. Extensive comparative evaluations demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms many state-of-the-art approaches, including both traditional and deep network-based ones, on the challenging i-LIDS, VIPeR, PRID2011 and CUHK01 datasets.",

We make the following contributions: (i) we show that given a few high-precision pose annotations, e.g. from a generic ConvNet pose estimator, additional annotations can be generated throughout the video using a combination of image-based matching for temporally distant frames, and dense optical flow for temporally local frames; (ii) we develop an occlusion aware self-evaluation model that is able to automatically select the high-quality and reject the erroneous additional annotations; and (iii) we demonstrate that these high-quality annotations can be used to fine-tune a ConvNet pose estimator and thereby personalize it to lock on to key discriminative features of the person's appearance. The outcome is a substantial improvement in the pose estimates for the target video using the personalized ConvNet compared to the original generic ConvNet.  Our method outperforms the state of the art (including top ConvNet methods) by a large margin on three standard benchmarks, as well as on a new challenging YouTube video dataset. Furthermore, we show that training from the automatically generated annotations can be used to improve the performance of a generic ConvNet on other benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Recognizing fine-grained sub-categories such as birds and dogs is extremely challenging due to the highly localized and subtle differences in some specific parts. Most previous works rely on object/part level annotations to build part-based representation, which is demanding in practical applications. This paper proposes an automatic fine-grained recognition approach which is free of any object/part annotation at both training and testing stages. Our method explores a unified framework based on two steps of deep filter response picking. The first picking step is to find distinctive filters which respond to specific patterns significantly and consistently, and learn a set of part detectors via iteratively alternating between new positive sample mining and part model retraining. The second picking step is to pool deep filter responses via spatially weighted combination of Fisher Vectors. We conditionally pick deep filter responses to encode them into the final representation, which considers the importance of filter responses themselves. Integrating all these techniques produces a much more powerful framework, and experiments conducted on CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Dogs demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm over the existing methods.",

        "abstract": "This paper approximates the 3D geometry of a scene by a small number of 3D planes. The method is especially suited to man-made scenes, and only requires two calibrated wide-baseline views as inputs. It relies on the computation of a dense but noisy 3D point cloud, as for example obtained by matching DAISY descriptors between the views.  It then segments one of the two reference images, and adopts a multi-model fitting process to assign a 3D plane to each region, when the region is not detected as occluded. A pool of 3D plane hypotheses is first derived from the 3D point cloud, to include planes that reasonably approximate the part of the 3D point cloud observed from each reference view between randomly selected triplets of 3D points. The hypothesis-to-region assignment problem is then formulated as an energy-minimization problem, which simultaneously optimizes an original data-fidelity term, the assignment smoothness over neighboring regions, and the number of assigned planar proxies. The synthesis of intermediate viewpoints demonstrates the effectiveness of our 3D reconstruction, and thereby the relevance of our proposed data-fidelity metric.",

As opposed to current techniques which either expect a single model to learn pose invariance through massive amounts of training data, or which normalize images to a single frontal pose, our method explicitly tackles pose variation by using multiple pose-specific models and rendered face images.  We leverage deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn discriminative representations we call Pose-Aware Models (PAMs) using 500K images from the CASIA WebFace dataset. We present a comparative evaluation on the new IARPA Janus Benchmark A (IJB-A) and PIPA datasets. On these datasets PAMs achieve remarkably better performance than commercial products and surprisingly also outperform methods that are specifically fine-tuned on the target dataset.",

        "abstract": "Understanding human actions is a key problem in computer vision. However, recognizing actions is only the first step of understanding what a person is doing. In this paper, we introduce the problem of predicting why a person has performed an action in images. This problem has many applications in human activity understanding, such as anticipating or explaining an action. To study this problem, we introduce a new dataset of people performing actions annotated with likely motivations. However, the information in an image alone may not be sufficient to automatically solve this task. Since humans can rely on their lifetime of experiences to infer motivation, we propose to give computer vision systems access to some of these experiences by using recently developed natural language models to mine knowledge stored in massive amounts of text. While we are still far away from fully understanding motivation, our results suggest that transferring knowledge from language into vision can help machines understand why people in images might be performing an action.",

        "abstract": "Many computational models of visual attention use image features and machine learning techniques to predict eye fixation locations as saliency maps. Recently, the success of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) for object recognition has opened a new avenue for computational models of visual attention due to the tight link between visual attention and object recognition. In this paper, we show that using features from DCNNs for object recognition we can make predictions that enrich the information provided by saliency models. Namely, we can estimate the reliability of a saliency model from the raw image, which serves as a meta-saliency measure that may be used to select the best saliency algorithm for an image. Analogously, the consistency of the eye fixations among  subjects, i.e. the agreement between the eye fixation locations of different subjects, can also be predicted and used by a designer to assess whether subjects reach a consensus about salient image locations.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach to tackle the challenging problem of 'online action localization' which entails predicting actions and their locations as they happen in a video. Typically, action localization or recognition is performed in an offline manner where all the frames in the video are processed together and action labels are not predicted for the future. This dis-allows timely localization of actions - an important consideration for surveillance tasks. In our approach, given a batch of frames from the immediate past in a video, we estimate pose and over- segment the current frame into superpixels. Next, we discriminatively train an actor foreground model on the superpixels using the pose bounding boxes. A Conditional Random Field with superpixels as nodes, and edges connecting spatio-temporal neighbors is used to obtain action segments. The action confidence is predicted using dynamic programming on SVM scores obtained on short segments of the video, thereby capturing sequential information of the actions. The issue of visual drift is handled by updating the appearance model and pose refinement in an online manner. Lastly, we introduce a new measure to quantify the performance of action prediction (i.e. online action localization), which analyzes how the prediction accuracy varies as a function of observed portion of the video. Our experiments suggest that despite using only a few frames to localize actions at each time instant, we are able to predict the action and obtain competitive results to state-of-the-art offline methods.",

We introduce three energies in terms of foreground and background probability distributions: Markov, spatiotemporal, and antagonistic energies. Then, we minimize a hybrid of the three energies to separate a primary object from its background. However, the hybrid energy is nonconvex. Therefore, we develop the alternate convex optimization (ACO) scheme, which decomposes the nonconvex optimization into two quadratic programs. Moreover, we propose the forward-backward strategy, which performs the segmentation sequentially from the first to the last frames and then vice versa, to exploit temporal correlations. Experimental results on extensive datasets demonstrate that the proposed ACO algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques significantly.",

Standard mean-field optimization is based on coordinate descent and in many situations can be impractical.

In this paper, we propose a novel proximal gradient-based approach to optimizing the variational objective. It is naturally parallelizable and easy to implement.  We  prove  its convergence, and then  demonstrate that,  in practice,  it yields faster  convergence and often  finds better optima than  more traditional mean-field optimization techniques.

This is problematic when it comes to their reconstruction through Structure from Motion (SfM).  We argue in this paper that a more expressive and general assumption can be made around compressible 3D structures.  The vision community, however, has hitherto struggled to formulate effective strategies for recovering such structures after projection without the aid of additional priors (e.g. temporal ordering, rigid substructures, etc.).  In this paper we present a \"prior-less\" approach to solve compressible SfM.  Specifically, we demonstrate how the problem of SfM - assuming compressible 3D structures - can be theoretically characterized as a block sparse dictionary learning problem.  We validate our approach experimentally by demonstrating reconstructions of 3D structures that are intractable using current state-of-the-art low-rank SfM approaches.",

It is challenging as objects in the wild could appear at arbitrary locations and in different scales. In this paper, we propose a novel classification architecture ProNet based on convolutional neural networks. It uses computationally efficient neural networks to propose image regions that are likely to contain objects, and applies more powerful but slower networks on the proposed regions. The basic building block is a multi-scale fully-convolutional network which assigns object confidence scores to boxes at different locations and scales. We show that such networks can be trained effectively using image-level annotations, and can be connected into cascades or trees for efficient object classification. ProNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art significantly on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO datasets for object classification and point-based localization.",

First, image matching relies on the descriptor for feature extraction, but the optimal descriptor often varies from image to image, or even patch to patch. Second, conventional matching approaches carry out geometric checking on a small set of correspondence candidates due to the concern of efficiency. It may result in restricted performance in recall. We aim at tackling the two issues by integrating adaptive descriptor selection and progressive candidate enrichment into image matching. We consider that the two integrated components are complementary: The high-quality matching yielded by adaptively selected descriptors helps in exploring more plausible candidates, while the enriched candidate set serves as a better reference for descriptor selection. It motivates us to formulate image matching as a joint optimization problem, in which adaptive descriptor selection and progressive correspondence enrichment are alternately conducted. Our approach is comprehensively evaluated and compared with the state-of-the-art approaches on two benchmarks. The promising results manifest its effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "Fine grained video action analysis often requires reliable detection and tracking of various interacting objects and human body parts, denoted as interactional object parsing. However, most of the previous methods based on either independent or joint object detection might suffer from high model complexity and challenging image content, e.g., illumination/pose/appearance/scale variation, motion, occlusion etc. In this work, we propose an end-to-end system based on recursive neural network to perform frame by frame interactional object parsing, which can alleviate the difficulty through a incremental manner. Our key innovation is that: instead of jointly outputting all object detections at once, for each frame, we use a set of long-short term memory (LSTM) nodes to incrementally refine the detections. After passing each LSTM node, more object detections are consolidated and thus more contextual information could be utilized to determine more difficult object detections. Extensive experiments on two benchmark fine grained activity datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves better interacting object detection performance, which in turn boosts the action recognition performance over the state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "Finding image correspondences remains a challenging problem in the presence of intra-class variations and large changes in scene layout. Semantic flow methods are designed to handle images depicting different instances of the same object or scene category.  We introduce a novel approach to semantic flow, dubbed proposal flow, that establishes reliable correspondences using object proposals. Unlike prevailing semantic flow approaches that operate on pixels or regularly sampled local regions, proposal flow benefits from the characteristics of modern object proposals, that exhibit high repeatability at multiple scales, and can take advantage of both local and geometric consistency constraints among proposals. We also show that proposal flow can effectively be transformed into a conventional dense flow field. We introduce a new dataset that can be used to evaluate both general semantic flow techniques and region-based approaches such as proposal flow. We use this benchmark to compare different matching algorithms, object proposals, and region features within proposal flow, to the state of the art in semantic flow. This comparison, along with experiments on standard datasets, demonstrates that proposal flow significantly outperforms existing semantic flow methods in various settings.",

Solving trace-norm regularized Trace-norm regularization plays an important role in many areas such as computer vision and machine learning. When solving general large-scale trace-norm regularized problems, existing methods may be computationally expensive due to many high-dimensional truncated singular value decompositions (SVDs) or the unawareness of matrix ranks. In this paper, we propose a proximal Riemannian pursuit (PRP) paradigm which addresses a sequence of trace-norm regularized subproblems defined on nonlinear matrix varieties. To address the subproblem, we extend the proximal gradient method on vector space to nonlinear matrix varieties, in which the SVDs of intermediate solutions are maintained by cheap low-rank QR decompositions, therefore making the proposed method more scalable. Empirical studies on several tasks, such as matrix completion and low-rank representation based subspace clustering, demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed paradigms over existing methods.",

While automated methods can produce high-quality results, their failures disappoint users in need of practical solutions.  We propose a resource allocation framework for predicting how best to allocate a fixed budget of human annotation effort in order to collect higher quality segmentations for a given batch of images and automated methods.  The framework is based on a proposed prediction module that estimates the quality of given algorithm-drawn segmentations.  We demonstrate the value of the framework for two novel tasks related to \"pulling the plug\" on computer and human annotators.  Specifically, we implement two systems that automatically decide, for a batch of images, when to replace 1) humans with computers to create coarse segmentations required to initialize segmentation tools and 2) computers with humans to create final, fine-grained segmentations.  Experiments demonstrate the advantage of relying on a mix of human and computer efforts over relying on either resource alone for segmenting objects in three diverse datasets representing visible, phase contrast microscopy, and fluorescence microscopy images.",

Both filter kernels in convolutional layers and weighting matrices in fully-connected layers are quantized, aiming at minimizing the estimation error of each layer's response. Extensive experiments on the ILSVRC-12 benchmark demonstrate 4 6x speed-up and 15 20x compression with merely one percentage loss of classification accuracy.

        "abstract": "Infinite dimensional covariance descriptors can provide richer and more discriminative information than their low dimensional counterparts. In this paper, we propose a novel image descriptor, namely, robust approximate infinite dimensional Gaussian (RAID-G). The challenges of RAID-G mainly lie on two aspects: (1) description of infinite dimensional Gaussian is difficult due to its non-linear Riemannian geometric structure and the infinite dimensional setting, hence effective approximation is necessary; (2) traditional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is not robust to high (even infinite) dimensional covariance matrix in Gaussian setting. To address these challenges, explicit feature mapping (EFM) is first introduced for effective approximation of infinite dimensional Gaussian induced by additive kernel function, and then a new regularized MLE method based on von Neumann divergence is proposed for robust estimation of covariance matrix. The EFM and proposed regularized MLE allow a closed-form of RAID-G, which is very efficient and effective for high dimensional features. We extend RAID-G by using the outputs of deep convolutional neural networks as original features, and apply it to material recognition. Our approach is evaluated on five material benchmarks and one fine-grained benchmark. It achieves 84.9% accuracy on FMD and 86.3% accuracy on UIUC material database, which are much higher than state-of-the-arts.",

Even when JPEG compression is set to its highest quality, the encoded sRGB image has been significantly processed in terms of color and tone manipulation.   This makes sRGB-JPEG images undesirable for many computer vision tasks that assume a direct relationship between pixel values and incoming light.  For such applications, the RAW image format is preferred, as RAW represents a minimally processed, sensor-specific RGB image with higher dynamic range that is linear with respect to scene radiance.   The drawback with RAW images, however, is that they require large amounts of storage and are not well-supported by many imaging applications.   To address this issue, we present a method to encode the necessary metadata within an sRGB image to reconstruct a high-quality RAW image.   Our approach requires no calibration of the camera and can reconstruct the original RAW to within  0.3% error with only a 64 KB overhead for the additional data.  More importantly, our output is a fully self-contained 100% complainant sRGB-JPEG file that can be used as-is, not affecting any existing image workflow - the RAW image can be extracted when needed, or ignored otherwise.  We detail our approach and show its effectiveness against competing strategies.",

Despite the remarkable success, the problems of object rotation, within-class variability, and between-class similarity remain several major challenges. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel and effective method to learn a rotation-invariant and Fisher discriminative CNN (RIFD-CNN) model. This is achieved by introducing and learning a rotation-invariant layer and a Fisher discriminative layer, respectively, on the basis of the existing high-capacity CNN architectures. Specifically, the rotation-invariant layer is trained by imposing an explicit regularization constraint on the objective function that enforces invariance on the CNN features before and after rotating. The Fisher discriminative layer is trained by imposing the Fisher discrimination criterion on the CNN features so that they have small within-class scatter but large between-class separation. In the experiments, we comprehensively evaluate the proposed method for object detection task on a public available aerial image dataset and the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset. State-of-the-art results are achieved compared with the existing baseline methods.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of rain streak removal from a single image. Rain streaks impair visibility of an image and introduce undesirable interference that can severely affect the performance of computer vision algorithms.   Rain streak removal can be formulated as a layer decomposition problem, with a rain streak layer superimposed on a background layer containing the true scene content. Existing decomposition methods that address this problem employ either dictionary learning methods or impose a low rank structure on the appearance of the rain streaks.   While these methods can improve the overall visibility, they tend to leave too many rain streaks in the background image or over-smooth the background image.   In this paper, we propose an effective method that uses simple patch-based priors for both the background and rain layers.  These priors are based on Gaussian mixture models and can accommodate multiple orientations and scales of the rain streaks. This simple approach removes rain streaks better than the existing methods qualitatively and quantitatively.  We overview our method and demonstrate its effectiveness over prior work on a number of examples.",

        "abstract": "Random features is an approach for kernel-based inference on large datasets. In this paper, we derive  performance guarantees for random features on signals, like images, that enjoy sparse representations and show that the number of random features required to achieve a desired approximation of the kernel similarity matrix can be significantly smaller for sparse signals. Based on this, we propose a scheme termed compressive random features that first obtains low-dimensional projections of a dataset and, subsequently, derives random features on the low-dimensional projections. This scheme provides significant improvements in signal dimensionality, computational time, and storage costs over traditional random features while enjoying similar theoretical  guarantees for achieving  inference performance. We support our claims by providing empirical results across many datasets.",

        "abstract": "For spectral embedding/clustering, it is still an open problem on how to construct an relation graph to reflect the intrinsic structures in data. In this paper, we proposed an approach, named Relation Discovery based Slow Feature Analysis (ReD-SFA), for feature learning and graph construction simultaneously. Given an initial graph with only a few nearest but most reliable pairwise relations, new reliable relations are discovered by an assumption of reliability preservation, i.e., the reliable relations will preserve their reliabilities in the learnt projection subspace. We formulate the idea as a cross entropy (CE) minimization problem to reduce the discrepancy between two Bernoulli distributions parameterized by the updated distances and the existing relation graph respectively. Furthermore, to overcome the imbalanced distribution of samples, a Boosting-like strategy is proposed to balance the discovered relations over all clusters. To evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments are performed with various trajectory clustering tasks, including motion segmentation, time series clustering and crowd detection. The results demonstrate that ReD-SFA can discover reliable intra-cluster relations with high precision, and competitive clustering performance can be achieved in comparison with state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "The deep two-stream architecture exhibited excellent performance on video based action recognition. The most computationally expensive step in this approach comes from the calculation of optical flow which prevents it to be real-time. This paper accelerates this architecture by replacing optical flow with motion vector which can be obtained directly from compressed videos without extra calculation. However, motion vector lacks fine structures, and contains noisy and inaccurate motion patterns, leading to the evident degradation of recognition performance. Our key insight for relieving this problem is that optical flow and motion vector are inherent correlated. Transferring the knowledge learned with optical flow CNN to motion vector CNN can significantly boost the performance of the latter. Specifically, we introduce three strategies for this, initialization transfer, supervision transfer and their combination. Experimental results show that our method achieves comparable recognition performance to the state-of-the-art, while our method can process 390.7 frames per second, which is 27 times faster than the original two-stream method.",

Yet, the precision of existing depth scanners is not accurate enough to recover fine details of a scanned object. While modern shading based depth refinement methods have been proven to work well with Lambertian objects, they break down in the presence of specularities. We present a novel shape from shading framework that addresses this issue and enhances both diffuse and specular objects' depth profiles. We take advantage of the built-in monochromatic IR projector and IR images of the RGB-D scanners and present a lighting model that accounts for the specular regions in the input image. Using this model, we reconstruct the depth map in real-time. Both quantitative tests and visual evaluations prove that the proposed method produces state of the art depth reconstruction results.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a real-time salient object detection system based on the minimum spanning tree. Due to the fact that background regions are typically connected to the image boundaries, salient objects can be extracted by computing the distances to the boundaries. However, measuring the image boundary connectivity efficiently is a challenging problem. Existing methods either rely on superpixel representation to reduce the processing units or approximate the distance transform. Instead, we propose an exact and iteration free solution on a minimum spanning tree. The minimum spanning tree representation of an image inherently reveals the object geometry information in a scene. Meanwhile, it largely reduces the search space of shortest paths, resulting an efficient and high quality distance transform algorithm. We further introduce a boundary dissimilarity measure to compliment the shortage of distance transform for salient object detection. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed algorithm achieves the leading performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Recently, several models based on deep neural networks have achieved great success in terms of both reconstruction accuracy and computational performance for single image super-resolution. In these methods, the low resolution (LR) input image is upscaled to the high resolution (HR) space using a single filter, commonly bicubic interpolation, before reconstruction. This means that the  super-resolution (SR) operation is performed in HR space. We demonstrate that this is sub-optimal and adds computational complexity. In this paper, we present the first convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of real-time SR of 1080p videos on a single K2 GPU. To achieve this, we propose a novel CNN architecture where the feature maps are extracted in the LR space. In addition, we introduce an efficient sub-pixel convolution layer which learns an array of upscaling filters to upscale the final LR feature maps into the HR output. By doing so, we effectively replace the handcrafted bicubic filter in the SR pipeline with more complex upscaling filters specifically trained for each feature map, whilst also reducing the computational complexity of the overall SR operation. We evaluate the proposed approach using images and videos from publicly available datasets and show that it performs significantly better (+0.15dB on Images and +0.39dB on Videos) and is an order of magnitude faster than previous CNN-based methods.",

Handled objects are crucially important for egocentric ADL recognition. For specific examination of objects related to users' actions separately from other objects in an environment, many previous works have addressed the detection of handled objects in images captured from head-mounted and chest-mounted cameras. Nevertheless, detecting handled objects is not always easy because they tend to appear small in images. They can be occluded by a user's body. As described herein, we mount a camera on a user's wrist. A wrist-mounted camera can capture handled objects at a large scale, and thus it enables us to skip the object detection process. To compare a wrist-mounted camera and a head-mounted camera, we also developed a novel and publicly available dataset that includes videos and annotations of daily activities captured simultaneously by both cameras. Additionally, we propose a discriminative video representation that retains spatial and temporal information after encoding the frame descriptors extracted by convolutional neural networks.",

        "abstract": "Physical fluents, a term originally used by Newton [40], refers to time-varying object states in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we are interested in inferring the fluents of vehicles from video. For example, a door (hood, trunk) is open or closed through various actions, light is blinking to turn. Recognizing these fluents has broad applications, yet have received scant attention in the computer vision literature. Car fluent recognition entails a unified framework for car detection, car part localization and part status recognition, which is made difficult by large structural and appearance variations, low resolutions and occlusions. This paper learns a spatial-temporal And-Or hierarchical model to represent car fluents. The learning of this model is formulated under the latent structural SVM framework. Since there are no publicly related dataset, we collect and annotate a car fluent dataset consisting of car videos with diverse fluents. In experiments, the proposed method outperforms several highly related baseline methods in terms of car fluent recognition and car part localization.",

        "abstract": "Advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques tried to automatically categorize the emotions elicited by abstract paintings with limited success. Since the annotation of the emotional content is highly resource-consuming, datasets of abstract paintings are either constrained in size or partially annotated. Consequently, it is natural to address the targeted task within a transductive framework. Intuitively, the use of multi-label classification techniques is desirable so to synergically exploit the relations between multiple latent variables, such as emotional content, technique, author, etc. A very popular approach for transductive multi-label recognition under linear classification settings is matrix completion. In this study we introduce non-linear matrix completion (NLMC), thus extending classical linear matrix completion techniques to the non-linear case. Together with the theory grounding the model, we propose an efficient optimization solver. As shown by our extensive experimental validation on two publicly available datasets, NLMC outperforms state-of-the-art methods when recognizing emotions from abstract paintings.",

Our work will impact several first-person vision tasks that need the detailed understanding of social interactions, such as automatic video summarization of group events and assistive systems. To recognize micro-level actions and reactions, such as slight shifts in attention, subtle nodding, or small hand actions, where only subtle body motion is apparent, we propose to use paired egocentric videos recorded by two interacting people. We show that the first-person and second-person points-of-view features of two people, enabled by paired egocentric videos, are complementary and essential for reliably recognizing micro-actions and reactions. We also build a new dataset of dyadic (two-persons) interactions that comprises more than 1000 pairs of egocentric videos to enable systematic evaluations on the task of micro-action and reaction recognition.",

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks with alternating convolutional, max-pooling and decimation layers are widely used in state of the art architectures for computer vision. Max-pooling purposefully discards precise spatial information in order to create features that are more robust, and typically organized as lower resolution spatial feature maps. On some tasks, such as whole-image classification, max-pooling derived features are well suited; however, for tasks requiring precise localization, such as pixel level prediction and segmentation, max-pooling destroys exactly the information required to perform well. Precise localization may be preserved by shallow convnets without pooling but at the expense of robustness.  Can we have our max-pooled multi-layered cake and eat it too? Several papers have proposed summation and concatenation based methods for combining upsampled coarse, abstract features with finer features to produce robust pixel level predictions. Here we introduce another model --- dubbed Recombinator Networks --- where coarse features inform finer features early in their formation such that finer features can make use of several layers of computation in deciding how to use coarse features. The model is trained once, end-to-end  and performs better than summation-based architectures, reducing the error from the previous state of the art on two facial keypoint datasets, AFW and AFLW, by 30% and beating the current state-of-the-art on 300W without using extra data. We improve performance even further by adding a denoising prediction model based on a novel convnet formulation.",

To this end, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture which takes in CS measurements of an image as input and outputs  an intermediate  reconstruction.  We call this network, ReconNet. The intermediate reconstruction is fed into an off-the-shelf denoiser to obtain the final reconstructed image. On a standard dataset of  images we show significant improvements in reconstruction results (both in terms of PSNR and time complexity) over state-of-the-art iterative CS reconstruction algorithms at various measurement rates. Further, through qualitative experiments on real data collected using our block SPC (single pixel camera), we show that our network is highly robust to sensor noise and can recover visually better quality images than competitive algorithms at extremely low sensing rates of 0.1 and 0.04. To demonstrate that our algorithm can recover semantically informative images even at a low measurement rate of 0.01, we present a very robust proof of concept real-time visual tracking application.",

However, it comes with many challenging issues because the appearances of thin film can change dramatically depending on view and light directions. The appearance is deeply dependent on not only the shapes but also the optical parameters of thin film. In this paper, we propose a novel method to estimate shapes and film thickness. First, we narrow down candidates of zenith angle by degree of polarization and determine it by the intensity of thin film which increases monotonically along the zenith angle. Second, we determine azimuth angle from occluding boundaries. Finally, we estimate the film thickness by comparing a look-up table of color along the thickness and zenith angle with captured images. We experimentally evaluated the accuracy of estimated shapes and appearances and found that our proposed method is effective.",

        "abstract": "Object detection and 6D pose estimation in the crowd (scenes with multiple object instances, severe foreground occlusions and background distractors), has become an important problem in many rapidly evolving technological areas such as robotics and augmented reality. Single shot-based 6D pose estimators with manually designed features are still unable to tackle the above challenges, motivating the research towards unsupervised feature learning and next-best-view estimation. In this work, we present a complete framework for both single shot-based 6D object pose estimation and next-best-view prediction based on Hough Forests, the state of the art object pose estimator that performs classification and regression jointly. Rather than using manually designed features we a) propose an unsupervised feature learnt from depth-invariant patches using a Sparse Autoencoder and b) offer an extensive evaluation of various state of the art features. Furthermore, taking advantage of the clustering performed in the leaf nodes of Hough Forests, we learn to estimate the reduction of uncertainty in other views, formulating the problem of selecting the next-best-view. To further improve pose estimation, we propose an improved joint registration and hypotheses verification module as a final refinement step to reject false detections. We provide two additional challenging datasets inspired from realistic scenarios to extensively evaluate the state of the art and our framework. One is related to domestic environments and the other depicts a bin-picking scenario mostly found in industrial settings. We show that our framework significantly outperforms state of the art both on public and on our datasets.",

Our method is built upon the fact that the speed of light varies with the refractive index of the medium and therefore the depth measurement of a transparent object with a ToF camera may be distorted. We show that, from this ToF distortion, the refractive light path can be uniquely determined by estimating a single parameter. We estimate this parameter by introducing a surface normal consistency between the one determined by a light path candidate and the other computed from the corresponding shape. The proposed method is evaluated by both simulation and real-world experiments and shows faithful transparent shape recovery.",

        "abstract": "Collecting training images for all visual categories is not only expensive but also impractical. Zero-shot learning (ZSL), especially using attributes, offers a pragmatic solution to this problem. However, at test time most attribute-based methods require a full description of attribute associations for each unseen class. Providing these associations is time consuming and often requires domain specific knowledge. In this work, we aim to carry out attribute-based zero-shot classification in an unsupervised manner. We propose an approach to learn relations that couples class embeddings with their corresponding attributes. Given only the name of an unseen class, the learned relationship model is used to automatically predict the class-attribute associations. Furthermore, our model facilitates transferring attributes across data sets without additional effort. Integrating knowledge from multiple sources results in a significant additional improvement in performance. We evaluate on two public data sets: Animals with Attributes and aPascal/aYahoo. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predicting class-attribute associations and unsupervised ZSL by a large margin.",

The convolutional network, recurrent layer, and temporal pooling layer, are jointly trained to act as a feature extractor for video-based re-identification using a Siamese network architecture. Our approach makes use of colour and optical flow information in order to capture appearance and motion information which is useful for video re-identification.

        "abstract": "Modeling the aging process of human face is important for cross-age face verification and recognition. In this paper, we introduce a recurrent face aging (RFA) framework based on a recurrent neural network which can identify the ages of people from 0 to 80. Due to the lack of labeled face data of the same person captured in a long range of ages, traditional face aging models usually split the ages into discrete groups and learn a one-step face feature transformation for each pair of adjacent age groups. However, those methods neglect the in-between evolving states between the adjacent age groups and the synthesized faces often suffer from severe ghosting artifacts. Since human face aging is a smooth progression, it is more appropriate to age the face by going through smooth transition states. In this way, the ghosting artifacts can be effectively eliminated and the intermediate aged faces between two discrete age groups can also be obtained. Towards this target, we employ a two-layer gated recurrent unit as the basic recurrent module whose bottom layer encodes a young face to a latent representation and the top layer decodes the representation to a corresponding older face. The experimental results demonstrate our proposed RFA provides better aging faces over other state-of-the-art age progression methods.",

Due to the accumulation and propagation of estimation error, model drifting often occurs and degrades the tracking performance. To mitigate this problem, in this paper we propose a novel tracking method called Recurrently Target-attending Tracking (RTT). RTT attempts to identify and exploit those reliable parts which are beneficial for the overall tracking process. To bypass occlusion and discover reliable components, multi-directional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are employed in RTT to capture long-range contextual cues by traversing a candidate spatial region from multiple directions. The produced confidence maps from the RNNs are employed to adaptively regularize the learning of discriminative correlation filters by suppressing clutter background noises while making full use of the information from reliable parts. To solve the weighted correlation filters, we especially derive an efficient closed-form solution with a sharp reduction in computation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed RTT is more competitive over those correlation filter based methods.",

        "abstract": "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently evinced immense success for various image recognition tasks. However, a question of paramount importance is somewhat unanswered in deep learning research - is the selected CNN optimal for the dataset in terms of accuracy and model size?  In this paper, we intend to answer this question and introduce a novel strategy that alters the architecture of a given CNN for a specified dataset, to potentially enhance the original accuracy while possibly reducing the model size. We use two operations for architecture refinement, viz. stretching and symmetrical splitting. Stretching increases the number of hidden units (nodes) in a  given CNN layer, while a symmetrical split of say K between two layers separates the input and output channels into K equal groups, and connects only the corresponding input-output channel groups.  Our procedure starts with a pre-trained CNN for a given dataset, and optimally decides the stretch and split factors across the network to refine the architecture. We empirically demonstrate the necessity of the two operations.   We evaluate our approach on two natural scenes attributes datasets, SUN Attributes  and CAMIT-NSAD, with architectures of GoogleNet and VGG-11, that are quite contrasting in their construction. We justify our choice of datasets, and show that they are interestingly distinct from each other, and together pose a challenge to our architectural refinement algorithm. Our results substantiate the usefulness of the proposed method.",

In this paper we propose Region Ranking SVM(RRSVM), a novel method for  pooling local information from multiple regions. RRSVM exploits the correlation of local regions in an image, and it jointly learns a region evaluation function and a scheme for integrating multiple regions.  Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007, VOC 2012, and ILSVRC2014 datasets show that RRSVM outperforms the methods that use the same feature type and extract features from the same set of local regions.

We exploit the regularity of urban scene facades as captured by their lattice structures and deduced from median-tiles' shape context, color, texture and spatial similarities. Our experimental results demonstrate effective matching of oblique and partially-occluded facades between aerial and ground views. Quantitative comparisons for automated urban scene facade matching from three cities show superior performance of our method over baseline SIFT, Root-SIFT and the more sophisticated Scale-Selective Self-Similarity and Binary Coherent Edge descriptors. We also illustrate regularity-based applications of occlusion removal from street views and higher-resolution texture-replacement in aerial views.",

For recognition, we use Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) grounded via a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) onto the video. Training of LSTM is regularized using the output of another encoder LSTM (eLSTM) grounded on 3D human-skeleton training data. For such regularized training of LSTM, we modify the standard backpropagation through time (BPTT) in order to address the well-known issues with gradient descent in constraint optimization. Our evaluation on three benchmark datasets -- Sports-1M, HMDB-51, and UCF101 -- shows accuracy improvements from 5.3% up to 17.4% relative to the state of the art.",

While methods like sliding windows have been successful and effective for many years, they are still brute-force, independent of the image content and the visual category being searched. In this paper we present formally rigorous sequential models that accumulate evidence collected at a small set of image locations in order to detect visual objects effectively. By formulating sequential search as reinforcement learning of the search policy (including the stopping condition), our fully trainable model can explicitly balance for each class, specifically, the conflicting goals of exploration -- sampling more image regions for better accuracy --, and exploitation -- stopping the search efficiently when sufficiently confident in the target's location. The methodology is general and applicable to any detector response function. We report encouraging results in the PASCAL VOC 2012 object detection test set showing that the proposed methodology achieves almost  two orders of magnitude speed-up over sliding window methods.",

For first-order MRFs with binary labels, Dead End Elimination (DEE) and QPBO can find the optimal labeling for some variables; the much harder case of larger label sets has been addressed by Kovtun and related methods which impose substantial computational overhead. We describe an efficient algorithm to correctly label a subset of the variables for arbitrary MRFs, with particularly good performance on binary MRFs. We propose a sufficient condition to check if a partial labeling is optimal, which is a generalization of DEE's purely local test. We give a hierarchy of relaxations that provide larger optimal partial labelings at the cost of additional computation. Empirical studies were conducted on several benchmarks, using expansion moves for inference. Our algorithm runs in a few seconds, and improves the speed of MRF inference with expansion moves by a factor of 1.5 to 12.",

Our approach first detects and removes the cloud-contaminated part of the image sequences, then recovers the missing scenes from the clean parts by the proposed \"TECROMAC\" (TEmporally Contiguous RObust MAtrix Completion) objective. The objective function balances temporal smoothness with a low rank solution while staying close to the original observations. The matrix where the rows are pixels and columns are the days of the image has low-rank because the pixels reflect land-types such as vegetation, roads and lakes and there are relatively few of these. We provide efficient optimization algorithms for TECROMAC, so we can run on images containing millions of pixels. Empirical results on real satellite image sequences as well as simulated data demonstrate that our approach is able to recover underlying images from heavily cloud-contaminated observations.",

Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we are exploring ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set and demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art via to carefully factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization: 21.2% top-1 and 5.6% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we propose a novel Reversible Recursive Instance-level Object Segmentation (R2-IOS) framework to address the challenging instance-level object segmentation task. R2-IOS consists of a reversible proposal refinement sub-network that predicts bounding box offsets for refining the object proposal locations, and an instance-level segmentation sub-network that generates the foreground mask of the dominant object instance in each proposal. By being recursive, R2-IOS iteratively optimizes the two sub-networks during joint training, in which the refined object proposals and improved segmentation predictions are alternately fed into each other to progressively increase the network capabilities. By being reversible, the proposal refinement sub-network adaptively determines an optimal number of refinement iterations required for each proposal during both training and testing. Furthermore, to handle multiple overlapped instances within a proposal, an  instance-aware denoising autoencoder is introduced into the segmentation sub-network to distinguish the dominant object from other distracting instances. Extensive experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark well demonstrate the superiority of R2-IOS over other state-of-the-art methods. In particular, the AP^r over 20 classes at 0.5 IoU achieves 66.7%, which significantly outperforms the results of 58.7% by PFN[15] and 46.3% by[17].",

Different from the existing discriminative methods that regress for the hand pose with a single depth image, we propose to first project the query depth image onto three orthogonal planes and utilize these multi-view projections to regress for 2D heat-maps which estimate the joint positions on each plane. These multi-view heat-maps are then fused to produce final 3D hand pose estimation with learned pose priors. Experiments show that the proposed method largely outperforms state-of-the-arts on a challenging dataset. Moreover, a cross-dataset experiment also demonstrates the good generalization ability of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Estimating blur kernels from real world images is a challenging problem as the linear image formation assumption does not hold when significant outliers, such as saturated pixels and non-Gaussian noise, are present. While some existing non-blind deblurring algorithms can deal with outliers to a certain extent, few blind deblurring methods are developed to well estimate the blur kernels from the blurred images with outliers. In this paper, we present an algorithm to address this problem by exploiting reliable edges and removing outliers in the intermediate latent images, thereby estimating blur kernels robustly. We analyze the effects of outliers on kernel estimation and show that most state-of-the-art blind deblurring methods may recover delta kernels when blurred images contain significant outliers. We propose a robust energy function which describes the properties of outliers for the final latent image restoration. Furthermore, we show that the proposed algorithm can be applied to improve existing methods to deblur images with outliers. Extensive experiments on different kinds of challenging blurry images with significant amount of outliers demonstrate the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.",

Novel data costs using angular entropy metric and adaptive defocus response are introduced. Integration of both data costs improves the occlusion and noise invariant capability significantly. Cost volume filtering and graph cut optimization are utilized to improve the accuracy of the depth map.

While many methods have been devoted to making these tasks robust to noise and outliers, less attention has been attracted to improving the feature tracking itself.  This paper introduces a novel multi-body feature tracker that takes advantage of the multi-body rigidity assumption to improve tracking robustness. A conventional approach to addressing this problem would consist of alternating between solving two subtasks: motion segmentation and feature tracking under rigidity constraints for each segment. This approach, however, requires knowing the number of motions, as well as assigning points to motion groups, which is typically sensitive to the motion estimates. By contrast, here, we introduce a segmentation-free solution to multi-body feature tracking that bypasses the motion assignment step and reduces to solving a series of subproblems with closed-form solutions. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of our approach in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness to noise.",

That is, the input frames are compounds of two imaging layers -- one desired background layer of the scene, and one distracting, possibly moving layer due to transparency or reflection. In this situation, the conventional brightness constancy constraint -- the cornerstone of most existing optical flow methods -- will no longer be valid. In this paper, we propose a robust solution to this problem. The proposed method performs both optical flow estimation, and image layer separation. It exploits a generalized double-layer brightness consistency constraint connecting these two tasks, and utilizes the priors for both of them. Experiments on both synthetic data and real images have confirmed the efficacy of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt towards handling generic optical flow fields of two-frame images containing transparency or reflection.",

RARE is a specially-designed deep neural network, which consists of a Spatial Transformer Network (STN) and a Sequence Recognition Network (SRN). In testing, an image is firstly rectified via a predicted Thin-Plate-Spline (TPS) transformation, into a more \"readable\" image for the following SRN, which recognizes text through a sequence recognition approach. We show that the model is able to recognize several types of irregular text, including perspective text and curved text. RARE is end-to-end trainable, requiring only images and associated text labels, making it convenient to train and deploy the model in practical systems.

        "abstract": "Because of the limitations of matrix factorization, such as losing spatial structure information, the concept of tensor factorization has been applied for the recovery of a low dimensional subspace from high dimensional visual data. Generally, the recovery is achieved by minimizing the loss function between the observed data and the factorization representation. Under different assumptions of the noise distribution, the loss functions are in various forms, like L1 and L2 norms. However, real data are often corrupted by noise with an unknown distribution. Then any specific form of loss function for one specific kind of noise often fails to tackle such real data with unknown noise. In this paper, we propose a tensor factorization algorithm to model the noise as a Mixture of Gaussians (MoG). As MoG has the ability of universally approximating any hybrids of continuous distributions, our algorithm can effectively recover the low dimensional subspace from various forms of noisy observations. The parameters of MoG are estimated under the EM framework and through a new developed algorithm of weighted low-rank tensor factorization (WLRTF). The effectiveness of our algorithm are substantiated by extensive experiments on both of synthetic data and real image data.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel method for tracking multiple moving objects and recovering their three-dimensional (3D) models separately using multiple calibrated cameras. For robustly tracking objects with similar appearances, the proposed method uses geometric information regarding 3D scene structure rather than appearance. A major limitation of previous techniques is foreground confusion, in which the shapes of objects and/or ghosting artifacts are ignored and are hence not appropriately specified in foreground regions. To overcome this limitation, our method classifies foreground voxels into targets (objects and artifacts) in each frame using a novel, probabilistic two-stage framework. This is accomplished by step-wise application of a track graph describing how targets interact and the maximum a posteriori expectation-maximization algorithm for the estimation of target parameters. We introduce mixture models with semiparametric component distributions regarding 3D target shapes. In order to not confuse artifacts with objects of interest, we automatically detect and track artifacts based on a closed-world assumption. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art trackers on seven public sequences while achieving real-time performance.",

        "abstract": "Recently, skeleton-based human action recognition has been receiving significant attention from various research communities due to the availability of depth sensors and real-time depth-based 3D skeleton estimation algorithms. In this work, we use rolling maps for recognizing human actions from 3D skeletal data. The rolling map is a well-defined mathematical concept that has not been explored much by the vision community. First, we represent each skeleton using the relative 3D rotations between various body parts. Since 3D rotations are members of the special orthogonal group SO(3), our skeletal representation becomes a point in the Lie group SO(3) X ... X SO(3), which is also a Riemannian manifold. Then, using this representation, we model human actions as curves in this Lie group. Since classification of curves in this non-Euclidean space is a difficult task, we unwrap the action curves onto the Lie algebra (which is a vector space) by combining the logarithm map with rolling maps, and perform classification in the Lie algebra. Experimental results on three action datasets show that the proposed approach performs equally well or better when compared to state-of-the-art.",

Our new solver, R5Pup, is an extension of the general minimal solution R6P, which uses a double linearized RS camera model initialized by the standard perspective P3P. Here, thanks to using known vertical directions, we avoid double linearization and can get the camera absolute pose directly from the RS model without the initialization by a standard P3P. Moreover, we need only five 2D-to-3D matches while R6P needed six such matches. We demonstrate in simulated and real experiments that our new R5Pup is robust, fast and a very practical method for absolute camera pose computation for modern cameras on mobile devices. We compare our R5Pup to the state of the art RS and perspective methods and demonstrate that it outperforms them when vertical direction is known in the range of accuracy available on modern mobile devices. We also demonstrate that when using R5Pup solver in structure from motion (SfM) pipelines, it is better to transform already reconstructed scenes into the standard position, rather than using hard constraints on the verticality of up vectors.",

        "abstract": "The vast majority of modern consumer-grade cameras employ a rolling shutter mechanism. In dynamic geometric computer vision applications such as visual SLAM, the so-called rolling shutter effect therefore needs to be properly taken into account. A dedicated relative pose solver appears to be the first problem to solve, as it is of eminent importance to bootstrap any derivation of multi-view geometry. However, despite its significance, it has received inadequate attention to date.  This paper presents a detailed investigation of the geometry of the rolling shutter relative pose problem. We introduce the rolling shutter essential matrix, and establish its link to existing models such as the push-broom cameras, summarized in a clean hierarchy of multi-perspective cameras. The generalization of well-established concepts from epipolar geometry is completed by a definition of the Sampson distance in the rolling shutter case. The work is concluded with a careful investigation of the introduced epipolar geometry for rolling shutter cameras on several dedicated benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Light fields (LFs) are image-based representation that records the radiance along all rays along every direction through every point in space. Traditionally LFs are acquired by using a 2D grid of evenly spaced pinhole cameras or by translating a pinhole camera along the 2D grid using a robot arm. In this paper, we present a novel LF sampling scheme by exploiting a special non-centric camera called the crossed-slit or XSlit camera. An XSlit camera acquires rays that simultaneously pass through two oblique slits. We show that, instead of translating the camera as in the pinhole case, we can effectively sample the LF by rotating individual or both slits while keeping the camera fixed. This leads a \"fixed-location\" LF acquisition scheme. We further show through theoretical analysis and experiments that the resulting XSlit LFs provide several advantages: they provide more dense spatial-angular sampling, are amenable multi-view stereo matching and volumetric reconstruction, and can synthesize unique refocusing effects.",

        "abstract": "Most convolutional neural networks (CNNs) lack midlevel layers that model semantic parts of objects. This limits CNN-based methods from reaching their full potential in detecting and utilizing small semantic parts in recognition. Introducing such mid-level layers can facilitate the extraction of part-specific features which can be utilized for better recognition performance. This is particularly important in the domain of fine-grained recognition.  In this paper, we propose a new CNN architecture that integrates semantic part detection and abstraction (SPDA-CNN) for fine-grained classification. The proposed network has two sub-networks: one for detection and one for recognition. The detection sub-network has a novel top-down proposal method to generate small semantic part candidates for detection. The classification sub-network introduces novel part layers that extract features from parts detected by the detection sub-network, and combine them for recognition. As a result, the proposed architecture provides an end-to-end network that performs detection, localization of multiple semantic parts, and whole object recognition within one framework that shares the computation of convolutional filters. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a large margin for small parts detection (e.g. our precision of 93.40% vs the best previous precision of 74.00% for detecting the head on CUB-2011). It also compares favorably to the existing state-of-the-art on fine-grained classification, e.g. it achieves 85.14% accuracy on CUB-2011.",

In this paper, we propose a sequential training method for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to effectively transfer pre-trained deep features for online applications. We regard a CNN as an ensemble with each channel of the output feature map as an individual base learner. Each base learner is trained using different loss criterions to reduce correlation and avoid over-training. To achieve the best ensemble online, all the base learners are sequentially sampled into the ensemble via important sampling. To further improve the robustness of each base learner, we propose to train the convolutional layers with random binary masks, which serves as a regularization to enforce each base learner to focus on different input features.  The proposed online training method is applied to visual tracking problem by transferring deep features trained on massive annotated visual data and is shown to significantly improve tracking performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on two challenging benchmark data set and demonstrate that our tracking algorithm can outperform state-of-the-art methods with a considerable margin.",

However, obtaining the shape of glossy objects like metals, plastics or ceramics remains challenging, since standard Lambertian cues like photo-consistency cannot be easily applied. In this paper, we derive a spatially-varying (SV)BRDF-invariant theory for recovering 3D shape and reflectance from light-field cameras. Our key theoretical insight is a novel analysis of diffuse plus single-lobe SVBRDFs under a light-field setup. We show that, although direct shape recovery is not possible, an equation relating depths and normals can still be derived. Using this equation, we then propose using a polynomial (quadratic) shape prior to resolve the shape ambiguity. Once shape is estimated, we can also recover the reflectance. We present extensive synthetic data on the entire MERL BRDF dataset, as well as a number of real examples to validate the theory, where we simultaneously recover shape and BRDFs from a single image taken with a Lytro Illum camera.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel method to perform weakly-supervised image parsing based on the dictionary learning framework. To deal with the challenges caused by the label ambiguities, we design a saliency guided weight assignment scheme to boost the discriminative dictionary learning. More specifically, with a collection of tagged images, the proposed method first conducts saliency detection and automatically infers the confidence for each semantic class to be foreground or background. These clues are then incorporated to learn the dictionaries, the weights, as well as the sparse representation coefficients in the meanwhile. Once obtained the coefficients of a superpixel, we use a sparse representation classifier to determine its semantic label. The approach is validated on the MSRC21, PASCAL VOC07, and VOC12 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the encouraging performance of our approach in comparison with some state-of-the-arts.",

However, only a handful of approaches have attempted to simultaneously address the related aspects of eye fixations and object saliency. In this work, we propose a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of predicting eye fixations and segmenting salient objects in a unified framework. We design the initial network layers, shared between both the tasks, such that they capture the object level semantics and the global contextual aspects of saliency, while the deeper layers of the network address task specific aspects. In addition, our network captures saliency at multiple scales via inception-style convolution blocks. Our network shows a significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art for both eye fixation prediction and salient object segmentation across a number of challenging datasets.",

        "abstract": "Scene parsing has attracted a lot of attention in computer vision. While parametric models have proven effective for this task, they cannot easily incorporate new training data. By contrast, nonparametric approaches, which bypass any learning phase and directly transfer the labels from the training data to the query images, can readily exploit new labeled samples as they become available. Unfortunately, because of the computational cost of their label transfer procedures, state-of-the-art nonparametric methods typically filter out most training images to only keep a few  relevant ones to label the query. As such, these methods throw away many images that still contain valuable information and generally obtain an unbalanced set of labeled samples. In this paper, we introduce a nonparametric approach to scene parsing that follows a sample-and-filter strategy. More specifically, we propose to sample labeled superpixels according to an image similarity score, which allows us to obtain a balanced set of samples. We then formulate label transfer as an efficient filtering procedure, which lets us exploit more labeled samples than existing techniques. Our experiments evidence the benefits of our approach over state-of-the-art nonparametric methods on two benchmark datasets.",

However, most existing approaches focus on learning a fixed distance metric for all instance pairs, while ignoring the individuality of each person. In this paper, we formulate the person re-identification problem as an imbalanced classification problem and learn a classifier specifically for each pedestrian such that the matching model is highly tuned to the individual's appearance. To establish correspondence between feature space and classifier space, we propose a Least Square Semi-Coupled Dictionary Learning (LSSCDL) algorithm to learn a pair of dictionaries and a mapping function efficiently. Extensive experiments on a series of challenging databases demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches, especially on the rank-1 recognition rate.",

        "abstract": "Subspace clustering methods based on ell_1, l_2 or nuclear norm regularization have become very popular due to their simplicity, theoretical guarantees and empirical success. However, the choice of the regularizer can greatly impact both theory and practice. For instance, ell_1 regularization is guaranteed to give a subspace-preserving affinity (i.e., there are no connections between points from different subspaces) under broad conditions e.g., arbitrary subspaces and corrupted data). However, it requires solving a large scale convex optimization problem. On the other hand, l_2 and nuclear norm regularization provide efficient closed form solutions, but require very strong assumptions to guarantee a subspace-preserving affinity, e.g., independent subspaces and uncorrupted data. In this paper we study a subspace clustering method based on orthogonal matching pursuit. We show that the method is both computationally efficient and guaranteed to give a subspace-preserving affinity under broad conditions. Experiments on synthetic data verify our theoretical analysis, and applications in handwritten digit and face clustering show that our approach achieves the best trade off between accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, our approach is the first one to handle 100,000 data points.",

        "abstract": "Image segmentation is a key component in many computer vision systems, and it is recovering a prominent spot in the literature as methods improve and overcome their limitations. The outputs of most recent algorithms are in the form of a hierarchical segmentation, which provides segmentation at different scales in a single tree-like structure. Commonly, these hierarchical methods start from some low-level features, and are not aware of the scale information of the different regions in them. As such, one might need to work on many different levels of the hierarchy to find the objects in the scene. This work tries to modify the existing hierarchical algorithm by improving their alignment, that is, by trying to modify the depth of the regions in the tree to better couple depth and scale. To do so, we first train a regressor to predict the scale of regions using mid-level features. We then define the anchor slice as the set of regions that better balance between over-segmentation and under-segmentation. The output of our method is an improved hierarchy, re-aligned by the anchor slice. To demonstrate the power of our method, we perform comprehensive experiments, which show that our method, as a post-processing step, can significantly improve the quality of the hierarchical segmentation representations, and ease the usage of hierarchical image segmentation to high-level vision tasks such as object segmentation. We also prove that the improvement generalizes well across different algorithms and datasets, with a low computational cost.",

        "abstract": "Scene labeling task is to segment the image into meaningful regions and categorize them into classes of objects which comprised the image. Commonly used methods typically find the local features for each segment and label them using classifiers. Afterwards, labeling is smoothed in order to make sure that neighboring regions receive similar labels. However, these methods ignore expressive connections between labels and non-local dependencies among regions. In this paper, we propose to use a sparse estimation of precision matrix (also called concentration matrix), which is the inverse of covariance matrix  of data obtained by graphical lasso to find interaction between labels and regions. To do this, we formulate the problem as an energy minimization over a graph, whose structure is captured by applying sparse constraint on the elements of the precision matrix. This graph encodes (or represents) only significant interactions and avoids a fully connected graph, which is typically used to reflect the long distance associations. We use local and global information to achieve better labeling. We assess our approach on three datasets and obtained promising results.",

        "abstract": "Since scenes are composed in part of objects, accurate recognition of scenes requires knowledge about both scenes and objects. In this paper we address two related problems: 1) scale induced dataset bias in multi-scale convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, and 2) how to combine effectively scene-centric and object-centric knowledge (i.e. Places and ImageNet) in CNNs. An earlier attempt, Hybrid-CNN, showed that incorporating ImageNet did not help much. Here we propose an alternative method taking the scale into account, resulting in significant recognition gains. By analyzing the response of ImageNet-CNNs and Places-CNNs at different scales we find that both operate in different scale ranges, so using the same network for all the scales induces dataset bias resulting in limited performance. Thus, adapting the feature extractor to each particular scale (i.e. scale-specific CNNs) is crucial to improve recognition, since the objects in the scenes have their specific range of scales. Experimental results show that the recognition accuracy highly depends on the scale, and that simple yet carefully chosen multi-scale combinations of ImageNet-CNNs and Places-CNNs, can push the state-of-the-art recognition accuracy in SUN397 up to 66.26% (and even 70.17% with deeper architectures, comparable to human performance).",

We note that for the topic of interactive image segmentation, scribbles are very widely used in academic research and commercial software, and are recognized as one of the most user-friendly ways of interacting. In this paper, we propose to use scribbles to annotate images, and develop an algorithm to train convolutional networks for semantic segmentation supervised by scribbles. Our algorithm is based on a graphical model that jointly propagates information from scribbles to unmarked pixels and learns network parameters. We present competitive object semantic segmentation results on the PASCAL VOC dataset by using scribbles as annotations. Scribbles are also favored for annotating stuff (e.g., water, sky, grass) that has no well-defined shape, and our method shows excellent results on the PASCAL-CONTEXT dataset thanks to extra inexpensive scribble annotations.",

To explore the feasibility of current computer vision techniques to address this problem, we created a new dataset of over 180,000 images taken by 41 well-known photographers. Using this dataset, we examined the effectiveness of a variety of features (low and high-level, including CNN features) at identifying the photographer. We also trained a new deep convolutional neural network for this task. Our results show that high-level features greatly outperform low-level features. We provide qualitative results using these learned models that give insight into our method's ability to distinguish between photographers, and allow us to draw interesting conclusions about what specific photographers shoot. We also demonstrate two applications of our method.",

        "abstract": "When human annotators are given a choice about what to label in an image, they apply their own subjective judgments on what to ignore and what to mention.  We refer to these noisy \"human-centric\" annotations as exhibiting human reporting bias.  Examples of such annotations include image tags and keywords found on photo sharing sites, or in datasets containing image captions. In this paper, we use these noisy annotations for learning visually correct image classifiers. Such annotations do not use consistent vocabulary, and miss a significant amount of the information present in an image; however, we demonstrate that the noise in these annotations exhibits structure and can be modeled. We propose an algorithm to decouple the human reporting bias from the correct visually grounded labels. Our results are highly interpretable for reporting \"what's in the image\" versus \"what's worth saying.\"  We demonstrate the algorithm's efficacy along a variety of metrics and datasets, including MS COCO and Yahoo Flickr 100M. We show significant improvements over traditional algorithms for both image classification and image captioning, doubling the performance of existing methods in some cases.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies in computer vision have shown that, while practically invisible to a human observer, skin color changes due to blood flow can be captured on face videos and, surprisingly, be used to estimate the heart rate (HR). While considerable progress has been made in the last few years, still many issues remain open. In particular, state-of-the-art approaches are not robust enough to operate in natural conditions (e.g. in case of spontaneous movements, facial expressions, or illumination changes). Opposite to previous approaches that estimate the HR by processing all the skin pixels inside a fixed region of interest, we introduce a strategy to dynamically select face regions useful for robust HR estimation. Our approach, inspired by recent advances on matrix completion theory, allows us to predict the HR while simultaneously discover the best regions of the face to be used for estimation. Thorough experimental evaluation conducted on public benchmarks suggests that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art HR estimation methods in naturalistic conditions.",

Our formulation is a convex relaxation which we augment with a crucial non-convex constraint that ensures exact handling of visibility. To tackle the non-convex minimization problem, we propose a majorize-minimize type strategy which converges to a critical point. We demonstrate the benefits of using the non-convex constraint experimentally. For the geometry-only case, we set a new state of the art on two datasets of the commonly used Middlebury multi-view stereo benchmark. Moreover, our general-purpose formulation directly reconstructs thin objects, which are usually treated with specialized algorithms. A qualitative evaluation on the dense semantic 3D reconstruction task shows that we improve significantly over previous methods.",

However most of the top performing approaches provide state of art results at high computational costs. In this work we propose a fast solution for achieving state of art results for both pedestrian detection and semantic segmentation.  As baseline for pedestrian detection we use sliding windows over cost efficient multiresolution filtered LUV+HOG channels. We use the same channels for classifying pixels into eight semantic classes. Using short range and long range multiresolution channel features we achieve more robust  segmentation results compared to traditional codebook based approaches at much lower computational costs. The resulting segmentations are used as additional semantic channels in order to achieve a more powerful pedestrian detector. To also achieve fast pedestrian detection we employ a multiscale detection scheme based on a single flexible pedestrian model and a single image scale. The proposed solution provides competitive results on both pedestrian detection and semantic segmentation benchmarks at 8 FPS on CPU and at 15 FPS on GPU, being the fastest top performing approach.",

        "abstract": "Edge-preserving image operations aim at smoothing an image without blurring the edges. Many excellent edge-preserving filtering techniques have been proposed recently to reduce the computational complexity or/and separate different scale structures. They normally adopt a user-selected scale measurement to control the detail/texture smoothing. However, natural photos contain objects of different sizes which cannot be described by a single scale measurement. On the other hand, edge/contour detection/analysis is closely related to edge-preserving filtering and has achieved significant progress recently. Nevertheless, most of the state-of-the-art filtering techniques ignore the success in this area. Inspired by the fact that learning-based edge detectors/classifiers significantly outperform traditional manually-designed detectors, this paper proposes a learning-based edge-preserving filtering technique. It synergistically combines the efficiency of the recursive filter and the effectiveness of the recent edge detector for scale-aware edge-preserving filtering. Unlike previous filtering methods, the propose filter can efficiently extract subjectively-meaningful structures from natural scenes containing multiple-scale objects.",

Recent work has shown that complementing CNNs with fully-connected conditional random fields (CRFs) can significantly enhance their object localization accuracy, yet dense CRF inference is computationally expensive. We propose replacing the fully-connected CRF with domain transform (DT), a modern edge-preserving filtering method in which the amount of smoothing is controlled by a reference edge map. Domain transform filtering is several times faster than dense CRF inference and we show that it yields comparable semantic segmentation results, accurately capturing object boundaries. Importantly, our formulation allows learning the reference edge map from intermediate CNN features instead of using the image gradient magnitude as in standard DT filtering. This produces task-specific edges in an end-to-end trainable system optimizing the target semantic segmentation quality.",

        "abstract": "Semantic object parsing is a fundamental task for understanding objects in detail in computer vision community, where incorporating multi-level contextual information is critical for achieving such fine-grained pixel-level recognition. Prior methods often leverage the contextual information through post-processing predicted confidence maps. In this work, we propose a novel deep Local-Global Long Short-Term Memory (LG-LSTM) architecture to seamlessly incorporate short-distance and long-distance spatial dependencies into the feature learning over all pixel positions. In each LG-LSTM layer, local guidance from neighboring positions and global guidance from the whole image are imposed on each position to better exploit complex local and global contextual information. Individual LSTMs for distinct spatial dimensions are also utilized to intrinsically capture various spatial layouts of semantic parts in the images, yielding distinct hidden and memory cells of each position for each dimension. In our parsing approach, several LG-LSTM layers are stacked and appended to the intermediate convolutional layers to directly enhance visual features, allowing network parameters to be learned in an end-to-end way. The long chains of sequential computation by stacked LG-LSTM layers also enable each pixel to sense a much larger region for inference benefiting from the memorization of previous dependencies in all positions along all dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on three public datasets well demonstrate the significant superiority of our LG-LSTM over other state-of-the-art methods for object parsing.",

        "abstract": "The state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation is currently represented by fully convolutional networks (FCNs). However, FCNs use large receptive fields and many pooling layers, both of which cause blurring and low spatial resolution in the deep layers. As a result FCNs tend to produce segmentations that are poorly localized around object boundaries. Prior work has attempted to address this issue in post-processing steps, for example using a color-based CRF on top of the FCN predictions. However, these approaches require additional parameters and low-level features that are difficult to tune and integrate into the original network architecture. Additionally, most CRFs use color-based pixel affinities, which are not well suited for semantic segmentation and lead to spatially disjoint predictions.  To overcome these problems, we introduce a Boundary Neural Field (BNF), which is a global energy model integrating FCN predictions with boundary cues. The boundary information is used to enhance semantic segment coherence and to improve object localization. Specifically, we first show that the convolutional filters of semantic FCNs provide good features for boundary detection. We then employ the predicted boundaries to define pairwise potentials in our energy. Finally, we show that our energy decomposes semantic segmentation into multiple binary problems, which can be relaxed for efficient global optimization. We report extensive experiments demonstrating that minimization of our global boundary-based energy yields results superior to prior globalization methods, both quantitatively  as well as qualitatively.",

        "abstract": "Despite significant progress in object categorization, in recent years, a number of important challenges remain; mainly, ability to learn from limited labeled data and ability to recognize object classes within large, potentially open, set of labels. Zero-shot learning is one way of addressing these challenges, but it has only been shown to work with limited sized class vocabularies and typically requires separation between supervised and unsupervised classes, allowing former to inform the latter but not vice versa. We propose the notion of semi-supervised vocabulary-informed learning to alleviate the above mentioned challenges and address problems of supervised, zero-shot and open set recognition using a unified framework. Specifically, we propose a maximum margin framework for semantic manifold-based recognition that incorporates distance constraints from (both supervised and unsupervised) vocabulary atoms, ensuring that labeled samples are projected closest to their correct prototypes, in the embedding space, than to others. We show that resulting model shows improvements in supervised, zero-shot, and large open set recognition, with up to 310K class vocabulary on AwA and ImageNet datasets.",

        "abstract": "Supervised contour detection methods usually require many labeled training images to obtain satisfactory performance. However, a large set of annotated data might be unavailable or extremely labor intensive. In this paper, we investigate the usage of semi-supervised learning (SSL) to obtain competitive detection accuracy with very limited training data (three labeled images). Specifically, we propose a semi-supervised structured ensemble learning approach for contour detection built on structured random forests (SRF). To allow SRF to be applicable to unlabeled data, we present an effective sparse representation approach to capture inherent structure in image patches by finding a compact and discriminative low-dimensional subspace representation in an unsupervised manner, enabling the incorporation of abundant unlabeled patches with their estimated structured labels to help SRF perform better node splitting. We re-examine the role of sparsity and propose a novel and fast sparse coding algorithm to boost the overall learning efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply SSL for contour detection. Extensive experiments on the BSDS500 segmentation dataset and the NYU Depth dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.",

This paper, however, addresses the problem with a completely data-driven approach by training a convolutional neural network (convnet). The learning process is formulated as a minimization of a loss function that measures the Euclidean distance of the predicted saliency map with the provided ground truth. The recent publication of large datasets of saliency prediction has provided enough data to train end-to-end architectures that are both fast and accurate. Two designs are proposed: a shallow convnet trained from scratch, and a another deeper solution whose first three layers are adapted from another network trained for classification.

Wasserstein distance defines a Riemannian metric for the Wasserstein space. It intrinsically measures the similarities between shapes and is robust to image noise. Thus it has the potential for the 3D shape indexing and classification research. While the algorithms for computing Wasserstein distance have been extensively studied, most of them only work for genus-0 surfaces. This paper proposes a novel framework to compute Wasserstein distance between general topological surfaces with hyperbolic metric. The computational algorithms are based on Ricci flow, hyperbolic harmonic map, and hyperbolic power Voronoi diagram and the method is general and robust. We apply our method to study human facial expression, longitudinal brain cortical morphometry with normal aging, and cortical shape classification in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Experimental results demonstrate that our method may be used as an effective shape index, which outperforms some other standard shape measures in our AD versus healthy control classification study.",

Our method relies on a novel distance estimator: the residual-aware distance estimator, that accounts for the residual distances of data points to their respective quantized centroids, and uses it for accurate shortlist computation.  Furthermore, we perform the residual-aware distance estimation with little additional memory and computational cost through simple pre-computation methods for inverted index and multi-index schemes. Because it modifies the initial shortlist collection phase, our new algorithm is applicable to most inverted indexing methods that use vector quantization. We have tested the proposed method with the inverted index and multi-index on a diverse set of benchmarks including up to one billion data points with varying dimensions, and found that our method robustly improves the accuracy of shortlists (up to 127% relatively higher) over the state-of-the-art techniques with a comparable or even faster computational cost.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a tracker, which is radically different from state-of-the-art trackers: we apply no model updating, no occlusion detection, no combination of trackers, no geometric matching, and still deliver state-of-the-art tracking performance, as demonstrated on the popular online tracking benchmark (OTB) and six very challenging YouTube videos. The presented tracker simply matches the initial patch of the target in the first frame with candidates in a new frame and returns the most similar patch by a learned matching function. The strength of the matching function comes from being extensively trained generically, i.e., without any data of the target, using a Siamese deep neural network, which we design for tracking. Once learned, the matching function is used as is, without any adapting, to track previously unseen targets. It turns out that the learned matching function is so powerful that a simple tracker built upon it, coined Siamese INstance search Tracker, SINT, which only uses the original observation of the target from the first frame, suffices to reach state-of-the-art performance. Further, we show the proposed tracker even allows for target re-identification after the target was absent for a complete video shot.",

Such variation is not arbitrary as body parts (e.g. head, torso, legs) have relative stable spatial distribution. Breaking down the variability of global appearance regarding the spatial distribution potentially benefits the person matching. We therefore learn a novel similarity function, which consists of multiple sub-similarity measurements with each taking in charge of a subregion. In particular, we take advantage of the recently proposed polynomial feature map to describe the matching within each subregion, and inject all the feature maps into a unified framework. The framework not only  outputs similarity measurements for different regions, but also makes a better consistency among them. Our framework can collaborate local similarities as well as global similarity to exploit their complementary strength. It is flexible to incorporate multiple visual cues to further elevate the performance. In experiments, we analyze the effectiveness of the major components. The results on four datasets show significant and consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.",

The proposed method represents a given curve as a point in the deformation space, the direct product of rigid transformation matrices, such that the  successive action of the matrices on a fixed starting point reconstructs the full curve. In general, both open and closed curves are represented in the deformation space modulo shape orientation and orientation preserving diffeomorphisms. The use of direct product Lie groups to represent curved shapes led to an explicit formula for geodesic curves and the formulation of a similarity metric between shapes by the L2-norm on the Lie algebra. Additionally, invariance to reparametrization or estimation of point correspondence between shapes is performed as an intermediate step for computing geodesics. Furthermore, since there is no computation of differential quantities on the curves, our representation is more robust to local perturbations and needs no pre-smoothing. We compare our method with the elastic shape metric defined through the square root velocity (SRV) mapping, and other shape matching approaches.",

We consider this problem in the domain where the affinity relations involve groups of more than two nodes. Building on the previous formulation for the pairwise affinity case, we exploit the mathematical structures in the higher order case. We express the original minimal-rank and positive semi-definite (PSD) constraints in a form amenable for numerical implementation, as the original constraints are either intractable or even undefined in general in the higher order case. To scale to large problem sizes, we also propose an alternative formulation, so that it can be efficiently solved via stochastic optimization in an online fashion. We evaluate our algorithm with different applications to demonstrate its superiority, and show it can adapt to varying levels of unbalancedness of clusters.",

        "abstract": "Near-Infrared (NIR) images of most materials exhibit less texture or albedo variations making them beneficial for vision tasks such as intrinsic image decomposition and structured light depth estimation. Understanding the reflectance properties (BRDF) of materials in the NIR wavelength range can be further useful for many photometric methods including shape from shading and inverse rendering. However, even with less albedo variation, many materials e.g. fabrics, leaves, etc. exhibit complex fine-scale surface detail making it hard to accurately estimate BRDF. In this paper, we present an approach to simultaneously estimate NIR BRDF and fine-scale surface details by imaging materials under different IR lighting and viewing directions. This is achieved by an iterative scheme that alternately estimates surface detail and NIR BRDF of materials. Our setup does not require complicated gantries or calibration and we present the first NIR dataset of 100 materials including a variety of fabrics (knits, weaves, cotton, satin, leather), and organic (skin, leaves, jute, trunk, fur) and inorganic materials (plastic, concrete, carpet). The NIR BRDFs measured from material samples are used with a shape-from-shading algorithm to demonstrate fine-scale reconstruction of objects from a single NIR image.",

This proposed paradigm shift away from traditional frame cameras offers significant potential advantages: namely avoiding high data rates, dynamic range limitations and motion blur. Unfortunately, however, established computer vision algorithms may not at all be applied directly to event cameras.  Methods proposed so far to reconstruct images, estimate optical flow, track a camera and reconstruct a scene come with severe restrictions on the environment or on the motion of the camera, e.g. allowing only rotation. Here, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first algorithm to simultaneously recover the motion field and brightness image, while the camera undergoes a generic motion through any scene. Our approach employs minimisation of a cost function that contains the asynchronous event data as well as spatial and temporal regularisation within a sliding window time interval. Our implementation relies on GPU-based optimisation and runs in near real-time. In a series of examples, we demonstrate the successful operation of our framework, including in situations where conventional cameras heavily suffer from dynamic range limitations or motion blur.",

Understanding frame by frame changes in camera focal length is vital to accurately estimating camera pose and vital to accurately render virtual objects in a scene with the correct perspective. However, most approaches to camera calibration require geometric constraints from many frames or the observation of a 3D calibration object --- both of which may not be feasible in augmented reality settings. This paper introduces a calibration objects based on a flat lenticular array that creates a color coded light-field whose observed color changes depending on the angle from which it is viewed.  We derive an approach to estimate the focal length of the camera and the relative pose of an object from a single image.  We characterize the performance of camera calibration across various focal lengths and camera models, and we demonstrate the advantages of the focal length estimation in rendering a virtual object in a video with constant zooming.",

The transferred information is adequate to blow and sculpt the segmented image mask in to a bas-relief of the object.

        "abstract": "This paper aims to develop a method that can accurately estimate the crowd count from an individual image with arbitrary crowd density and arbitrary perspective. To this end,we have proposed a simple but effective Multi-column Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN) architecture to map the image to its crowd density map. The proposed MCNN allows the input image to be of arbitrary size or resolution. By utilizing filters with receptive fields of different sizes, the features learned by each column CNN are adaptive to variations in people/head size due to perspective effect or image resolution. Furthermore, the true density map is computed accurately based on geometry-adaptive kernels which do not need knowing the perspective map of the input image. Since exiting crowd counting datasets do not adequately cover all the challenging situations considered in our work, we have collected and labelled a large new dataset that includes 1198 images with about 330,000 heads annotated. On this challenging new dataset, as well as all existing datasets, we conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and method. In particular, with the proposed simple MCNN model, our method outperforms all existing methods. In addition, experiments show that our model, once trained on one dataset, can be readily transferred to a new dataset.",

We use FrameNet, a verb and role lexicon developed by linguists, to define a large space of possible situations and collect a large-scale dataset containing over 500 activities, 1,700 roles, 11,000 objects, 125,000 images, and 200,000 unique situations. We also introduce structured prediction baselines and show that, in activity-centric images, situation-driven prediction of objects and activities  outperforms independent object and activity recognition.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the problem of fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR), where free-hand human sketches are used as queries to perform instance-level retrieval of images. This is an extremely challenging task because (i) visual comparisons not only need to be fine-grained but also executed cross-domain, (ii) free-hand (finger) sketches are highly abstract, making fine-grained matching harder, and most importantly (iii) annotated cross-domain sketch-photo datasets required for training are scarce, challenging many state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.     In this paper, for the first time, we address all these challenges, providing a step towards the capabilities that would underpin a commercial sketch-based image retrieval application. We introduce a new database of 1,432 sketch-photo pairs from two categories with 32,000 fine-grained triplet ranking annotations. We then develop a deep triplet-ranking model for instance-level SBIR with a novel data augmentation and staged pre-training strategy to alleviate the issue of insufficient fine-grained training data. Extensive experiments are carried out to contribute a variety of insights into the challenges of data sufficiency and over-fitting avoidance when training deep networks for fine-grained cross-domain ranking tasks.",

In contrast to traditional approaches that use global appearance features or relay on keypoint features, our aim is to automatically learn the shared latent structures that exist between sketch images and real images, even when there are  significant appearance differences across its relevant real images. To accomplish this, we propose a deep convolutional neural network, named SketchNet. We firstly develop a triplet composed of sketch, positive and negative real image as the input of our neural network. To discover the coherent visual structures between the sketch and its positive pairs, we introduce the softmax as the loss function. Then a ranking mechanism is introduced to make the positive pairs obtain a higher score comparing over negative ones to achieve robust representation. Finally, we formalize above-mentioned constrains into the unified objective function, and create an ensemble feature representation to describe the sketch images. Experiments on the TU-Berlin sketch benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and show that deep feature representation brings substantial improvements over other state-of-the-art methods on sketch classification.",

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown its remarkable potential in learning appearance representations from images. However, the learning of dynamic representation, and how it can be effectively combined with appearance features for video analysis, remains an open problem. In this study, we propose a novel spatio-temporal CNN, named Slicing CNN (S-CNN), based on the decomposition of 3D feature maps into 2D spatio- and 2D temporal-slices representations. The decomposition brings unique advantages: (1) the model is capable of capturing dynamics of different semantic units such as groups and objects, (2) it learns separated appearance and dynamic representations while keeping proper interactions between them, and (3) it exploits the selectiveness of spatial filters to discard irrelevant background clutter for crowd understanding. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed S-CNN model on the WWW crowd video dataset for attribute recognition and observe significant performance improvements to the state-of-the-art methods (62.55% from 51.84% [21]).",

        "abstract": "How can unlabeled video augment visual learning? Existing methods perform \"slow\" feature analysis, encouraging temporal coherence, where the image representations of temporally close frames to exhibit only small differences.  While this standard approach captures the fact that high-level visual signals change slowly over time, it fails to capture *how* the visual content changes.  We propose to generalize slow feature analysis to \"steady\" feature analysis.  The key idea is to impose a prior that higher order derivatives in the learned feature space must be small.  To this end, we train a convolutional neural network with a regularizer that minimizes a contrastive loss on tuples of sequential frames from unlabeled video.  Focusing on the case of triplets of frames, the proposed method encourages that feature changes over time should be smooth, i.e., similar to the most recent changes.  Using five diverse image and video datasets, including unlabeled YouTube and KITTI videos, we demonstrate our method's impact on object recognition, scene classification, and action recognition tasks.  We further show that our features learned from unlabeled video can even surpass a standard heavily supervised pretraining approach.",

In our work, we propose a data-driven approach to learn these human-human interactions for predicting their future trajectories. This is in contrast to traditional approaches which use hand-crafted functions such as Social forces. We present a new Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model which  jointly reasons across multiple individuals in a scene. Different from the conventional LSTM, we share the information between multiple LSTMs through a new pooling layer. This layer pools the hidden representation from LSTMs corresponding to neighboring trajectories to capture interactions within this neighborhood. We demonstrate the performance of our method on several public datasets. Our model outperforms previous forecasting methods by more than 42% . We also analyze the trajectories predicted by our model to demonstrate social behaviours such as collision avoidance and group movement, learned by our model.",

        "abstract": "Object motion blur is a challenging problem as the foreground and the background in the scenes undergo different types of image degradation due to movements in various directions and speed. Most object motion deblurring methods address this problem by segmenting blurred images into regions where different kernels are estimated and applied for restoration. Segmentation on blurred images is difficult due to ambiguous pixels between regions, but it plays an important role for object motion deblurring. To address these problems, we propose a novel model for object motion deblurring. The proposed model is developed based on a maximum a posterior formulation in which soft-segmentation is incorporated for object layer estimation. We propose an efficient algorithm to jointly estimate object segmentation and camera motion where each layer can be deblurred well under the guidance of the soft-segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art object motion deblurring methods on challenging scenarios.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel computational puzzle solver for square-piece image jigsaw puzzles with no prior information such as piece orientation, anchor pieces or resulting dimension of the puzzle. By \"piece\" we mean a square dxd block of pixels, where we investigate pieces as small as 7x7 pixels. To reconstruct such challenging puzzles, we aim to search for piece configurations which maximize the size of consensus (i.e. grid or loop) configurations which represent a geometric consensus or agreement among pieces. Pieces are considered for addition to the existing assemblies if these pieces increase the size of the consensus configurations. In contrast to previous puzzle solvers which goal for assemblies maximizing compatibility measures between all pairs of pieces and thus depend heavily on the pairwise compatibility measure used, our new approach reduces the dependency on the pairwise compatibility measures which become increasingly uninformative at small scales and instead exploits geometric agreement among pieces. Our contribution also includes an improved pairwise compatibility measure which exploits directional derivative information along adjoining boundaries of the pieces. For the challenging unknown orientation piece puzzles where the size of pieces is small, we reduce assembly error by up to 75% compared with previous algorithms for standard datasets.",

In a discrete world, these relations can be described using low order difference equations or equivalently low order auto regressive (AR) models. In this paper, based on this intuition, we propose an algorithm for solving time-sort temporal puzzles, defined as scrambled time series that need to be sorted out. We frame this highly combinatorial problem using a mixed-integer semi definite programming formulation and show how to turn it into a mixed-integer linear programming problem by using the recently introduced atomic norm framework.

This begs the question if a computer can reach the same judgement. Earlier research has already pointed out that age, gender, and average attractiveness can be estimated with reasonable precision. We improve the state-of-the-art, but also predict - based on someone's known preferences - how much that particular person is attracted to a novel face. Our computational pipeline comprises a face detector, convolutional neural networks for the extraction of deep features, standard support vector regression for gender, age and facial beauty, and - as the main novelties - visual regularized collaborative filtering to infer inter-person preferences as well as a novel regression technique for handling visual queries without rating history. We validate the method using a very large dataset from a dating site as well as images from celebrities. Our experiments yield convincing results, i.e. we predict 76% of the ratings correctly solely based on an image, and reveal some sociologically relevant conclusions. We also validate our collaborative filtering solution on the standard MovieLens rating dataset, augmented with movie posters, to predict an individual's movie rating. We demonstrate our algorithms on howhot.io which went viral around the Internet with more than 50 million pictures evaluated in the first month.",

To enhance the performance of LDSs, in this paper, we address the challenging issue of performing sparse coding on the space of LDSs, where both data and dictionary atoms are LDSs. Rather than approximate the extended observability with a finite-order matrix, we represent the space of LDSs by an infinite Grassmannian consisting of the orthonormalized extended observability subspaces. Via a homeomorphic mapping, such Grassmannian is embedded into the space of symmetric matrices, where a tractable objective function can be derived for sparse coding. Then, we propose an efficient method to learn the system parameters of the dictionary atoms explicitly, by imposing the symmetric constraint to the transition matrices of the data and dictionary systems. Moreover, we combine the state covariance into the algorithm formulation, thus further promoting the performance of the models with symmetric transition matrices. Comparative experimental evaluations reveal the superior performance of proposed methods on various tasks including video classification and tactile recognition.",

        "abstract": "Discriminative sparse coding has emerged as a promising technique in image analysis and recognition, which couples the process of classifier training and the process of dictionary learning for improving the discriminability of sparse codes.  Many existing approaches consider only a simple single linear classifier whose discriminative power is rather weak. In this paper, we proposed a discriminative sparse coding method which jointly learns a dictionary for sparse coding and an ensemble classifier for discrimination. The ensemble classifier is composed of a set of linear predictors and constructed via both subsampling on data and subspace projection on sparse codes. The advantages of the proposed method over the existing ones are multi-fold: better discriminability of sparse codes, weaker dependence on peculiarities of training data, and more expressibility of classifier for classification. These advantages are also justified in the experiments, as our method outperformed several state-of-the-art methods in several recognition tasks.",

They were shown recently to outperform second-order approaches, however, the size of these tensors are exponential in the data dimensionality, which is a significant concern. In this paper, we study third-order super-symmetric tensor descriptors in the context of dictionary learning and sparse coding. For this purpose, we propose a novel non-linear third-order texture descriptor. Our goal is to approximate these tensors as sparse conic combinations of atoms from a learned dictionary. Apart from the significant benefits to tensor compression that this framework offers, our experiments demonstrate that the sparse coefficients produced by this scheme lead to better aggregation of high-dimensional data and showcase superior performance on two common computer vision tasks compared to the state of the art.",

In this paper, we propose and implement a pipeline for sparse to dense 3D construction with wide baseline images captured from a fast moving rolling shutter camera. pecifically, we propose a cost function for Bundle Adjustment (BA) that models the rolling shutter effect, incorporates GPS/INS readings, and enforces pairwise smoothness between neighboring poses. We optimize over the 3D structures, camera poses and velocities. We also introduce a novel interpolation scheme for the rolling shutter plane sweep stereo algorithm that allows us to achieve a 7x speed up in the depth map computations for dense reconstruction without losing accuracy. We evaluate our proposed pipeline over a 2.6km image sequence captured with a rolling shutter camera mounted on a moving car.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of 3D full-body human pose estimation from a monocular image sequence. Here, two cases are considered: (i) the image locations of the human joints are provided and (ii) the image locations of joints are unknown. In the former case, a novel approach is introduced that integrates a sparsity-driven 3D geometric prior and temporal smoothness. In the latter case, the former case is extended by treating the image locations of the joints as latent variables in order to take into account considerable uncertainties in 2D joint locations. A deep fully convolutional network is trained to predict the uncertainty maps of the 2D joint locations. The 3D pose estimates are realized via an Expectation-Maximization algorithm over the entire sequence, where it is shown that the 2D joint location uncertainties can be conveniently marginalized out during inference. Empirical evaluation on the Human3.6M dataset shows that the proposed approaches achieve greater 3D pose estimation accuracy over  state-of-the-art baselines.  Further, the proposed approach outperforms a publicly available 2D pose estimation baseline on the challenging PennAction dataset.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes to learn high-performance deep ConvNets with sparse neural connections, referred to as sparse ConvNets, for face recognition. The sparse ConvNets are learned in an iterative way, each time one additional layer is sparsified and the entire model is re-trained given the initial weights learned in previous iterations. One important finding is that directly training the sparse ConvNet from scratch failed to find good solutions for face recognition, while using a previously learned denser model to properly initialize a sparser model is critical to continue learning effective features for face recognition. This paper also proposes a new neural correlation-based weight selection criterion and empirically verifies its effectiveness in selecting informative connections from previously learned models in each iteration. When taking a moderately sparse structure 26%-76% of weights in the dense model), the proposed sparse ConvNet model significantly improves the face recognition performance of the previous state-of-the-art DeepID2+ models given the same training data, while it keeps the performance of the baseline model with only 12% of the original parameters.",

        "abstract": "A recent trend in saliency algorithm development is large-scale benchmarking and algorithm ranking with ground truth provided by datasets of human fixations. In order to accommodate the strong bias humans have toward central fixations, it is common to replace traditional ROC metrics with a shuffled ROC metric which uses randomly sampled fixations from other images in the database as the negative set. However, the shuffled ROC introduces a number of problematic elements, including a fundamental assumption that it is possible to separate visual salience and image spatial arrangement.  We argue that it is more informative to directly measure the effect of spatial bias on algorithm performance rather than try to correct for it. To capture and quantify these known sources of bias, we propose a novel metric for measuring saliency algorithm performance: the spatially binned ROC (spROC). This metric provides direct insight into the spatial biases of a saliency algorithm without sacrificing the intuitive raw performance evaluation of traditional ROC measurements. By quantitatively measuring the bias in saliency algorithms, researchers will be better equipped to select and optimize the most appropriate algorithm for a given task. We use a baseline measure of inherent algorithm bias to show that Adaptive Whitening Saliency (AWS) [14], Attention by Information Maximization (AIM) [8], and Dynamic Visual Attention (DVA) [20] provide the least spatially biased results, suiting them for tasks in which there is no information about the underlying spatial bias of the stimuli, whereas algorithms such as Graph Based Visual Saliency (GBVS) [18] and Context-Aware Saliency (CAS) [15] have a significant inherent central bias.",

The triangulation constraint however is invalid for moving points captured in multiple unsynchronized videos and bundle adjustment is not purposed to estimate the temporal alignment between cameras. In this paper, we present a spatiotemporal bundle adjustment approach that jointly optimizes four coupled sub-problems: estimating camera intrinsics and extrinsics, triangulating 3D static points, as well as subframe temporal alignment between cameras and estimating 3D trajectories of dynamic points. Key to our joint optimization is the careful integration of physics-based motion priors within the reconstruction pipeline, validated on a large motion capture corpus. We present an end-to-end pipeline that takes multiple uncalibrated and unsynchronized video streams and produces a dynamic reconstruction of the event. Because the videos are aligned with sub-frame precision, we reconstruct 3D trajectories of unconstrained outdoor activities at much higher temporal resolution than the input videos.",

Thus, we develop a multiple-layer SAN in which we query an image multiple times to infer the answer progressively. Experiments conducted on four image QA data sets demonstrate that the proposed SANs significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches. The visualization of the attention layers illustrates the progress that the SAN locates the relevant visual clues that lead to the answer of the question layer-by-layer.",

However, since the model that they learn depends strongly on the spatial layout of the tracked object, they are notoriously sensitive to deformation. Models based on colour statistics have complementary traits: they cope well with variation in shape, but suffer when illumination is not consistent throughout a sequence. Moreover, colour distributions alone can be insufficiently discriminative. In this paper, we show that a simple tracker combining complementary cues in a ridge regression framework can operate faster than 80 FPS and outperform not only all entries in the popular VOT14 competition, but also recent and far more sophisticated trackers according to multiple benchmarks.",

However, those systems usually suffer from low imaging quality and inaccurate depth acquisition under low-light conditions. To address the problem, we present a new stereo matching method with a color and monochrome camera pair. We focus on the fundamental trade-off that monochrome cameras have much better light-efficiency than color-filtered cameras. Our key ideas involve compensating for the radiometric difference between two cross-spectral images and taking full advantage of complementary data. Consequently, our method produces both an accurate depth map and high-quality images, which are applicable for various depth-aware image processing. Our method is evaluated using various datasets and the performance of our depth estimation consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel structural correlation filter (SCF) model for robust visual tracking. The proposed SCF model takes part-based tracking strategies into account in a correlation filter tracker, and exploits circular shifts of all parts for their motion modeling to preserve target object structure. Compared with existing correlation filter trackers, our proposed tracker has several advantages: (1) Due to the part strategy, the learned structural correlation filters are less sensitive to partial occlusion, and have computational efficiency and robustness. (2) The learned filters are able to not only distinguish the parts from the background as the traditional correlation filters, but also exploit the intrinsic relationship among local parts via spatial constraints to preserve object structure. (3) The learned correlation filters not only make most parts share similar motion, but also tolerate outlier parts that have different motion. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on challenging benchmark image sequences demonstrate that the proposed SCF tracking algorithm performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Deep Recurrent Neural Network architectures, though remarkably capable at modeling sequences, lack an intuitive high-level spatio-temporal structure. That is while many problems in computer vision inherently have an underlying high-level structure and can benefit from it. Spatio-temporal graphs are a popular  tool for imposing such high-level intuitions in the formulation of real world problems. In this paper, we propose an approach for combining the power of high-level spatio-temporal graphs and sequence learning success of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). We develop a scalable method for casting an arbitrary spatio-temporal graph as a rich RNN mixture that is feedforward, fully differentiable, and jointly trainable. The proposed method is generic and principled as it can be used for transforming any spatio-temporal graph through employing a certain set of well defined steps. The evaluations of the proposed approach on a diverse set of problems, ranging from modeling human motion to object interactions, shows improvement over the state-of-the-art with a large margin. We expect this method to empower  new approaches to problem formulation through high-level spatio-temporal graphs and Recurrent Neural Networks.",

        "abstract": "This paper shows for the first time that is possible to reconstruct the position of rigid objects and to jointly recover affine camera calibration solely from a set of object detections in a video sequence. In practice, this work can be considered as the extension of Tomasi and Kanade factorization method using objects. Instead of using points to form a rank constrained measurement matrix, we can form a matrix with similar rank properties using 2D object detection proposals. In detail, we first fit an ellipse onto the image plane at each bounding box as given by the object detector. The collection of all the ellipses in the dual space is used to create a measurement matrix that gives a specific rank constraint. This matrix can be factorised and metrically upgraded in order to provide the affine camera matrices and the 3D position of the objects as an ellipsoid. Moreover, we recover the full 3D quadric thus giving additional information about object occupancy and 3D pose. Finally, we also show that 2D points measurements can be seamlessly included in the framework to reduce the number of objects required. This last aspect unifies the classical point-based Tomasi and Kanade approach with objects in a unique framework. Experiments with synthetic and real data show the feasibility of our approach for the affine camera case.",

As a concrete example, group activity recognition involves the interactions and relative spatial relations of a set of people in a scene. State of the art recognition methods center on deep learning approaches for training highly effective, complex classifiers for interpreting images.  However, bridging the relatively low-level concepts output by these methods to interpret higher-level compositional scenes remains a challenge.  Graphical models are a standard tool for this task. In this paper, we propose a method to integrate graphical models and deep neural networks into a joint framework. Instead of using a traditional inference method, we use a sequential inference modeled by a recurrent neural network. Beyond this, the appropriate structure for inference can be learned by imposing gates on edges between nodes.  Empirical results on group activity recognition demonstrate the potential of this model to handle highly structured learning tasks.",

Different from existing approaches of modeling structures on score maps or predicted labels, feature maps preserve substantially richer descriptions of body joints. The relationships between feature maps of joints are captured with the introduced geometrical transform kernels, which can be easily implemented with a convolution layer. Features and their relationships are jointly learned in an end-to-end learning system. A bi-directional tree structured model is proposed, so that the feature channels at a body joint can well receive information from other joints. The proposed framework improves feature learning substantially. With very simple post processing, it reaches the best mean PCP on the LSP and FLIC datasets. Compared with the baseline of learning features at each joint separately with ConvNet, the mean PCP has been improved by 18% on FLIC. The code is released to the public.",

Beyond the standard L2 metric, various methods to measure similarity between features have been proposed mainly on the assumption that the features are defined in a histogram form. On the other hand, in a field of image quality assessment, SSIM produces effective similarity between images, taking the place of L2 metric. In this paper, we propose a feature similarity measurement method based on the SSIM. Unlike the previous methods, the proposed method is built on not a histogram form but a tensor structure of a feature array extracted such as on spatial grids, in order to construct effective SSIM-based similarity measure of high robustness which is a key requirement in feature matching. In addition, we provide the explicit feature map such that the proposed similarity metric is embedded as a dot product. It contributes to significant speedup in similarity measurement as well as to feature transformation toward an effective vector form to which linear classifiers are directly applicable. In the experiments on various tasks, the proposed method exhibits favorable performance in both feature matching and classification.",

To gain a full volumetric model, one needs either multiple views, or a single view together with a library of unambiguous 3D models that will fit the shape of each individual object in the scene.  We hypothesize that objects of dissimilar semantic classes often share similar 3D shape components, enabling a limited dataset to model the shape of a wide range of objects, and hence estimate their hidden geometry. Exploring this hypothesis, we propose an algorithm that can complete the unobserved geometry of tabletop-sized objects, based on a supervised model trained on already available volumetric elements. Our model maps from a local observation in a single depth image to an estimate of the surface shape in the surrounding neighborhood. We validate our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively on a range of indoor object collections and challenging real scenes.",

        "abstract": "Learning powerful feature representations with CNNs is hard when training data are limited. Pre-training is one way to overcome this, but it requires large datasets sufficiently similar to the target domain. Another option is to design priors into the model, which can range from tuned hyperparameters to fully engineered representations like Scattering Networks. We combine these ideas into structured receptive field networks, a model which has a fixed filter basis and yet retains the flexibility of CNNs. This flexibility is achieved by expressing receptive fields in CNNs as a weighted sum over a fixed basis which is similar in spirit to Scattering Networks. The key difference is that we learn arbitrary effective filter sets from the basis rather than modeling the filters. This approach explicitly connects classical multiscale image analysis with general CNNs. With structured receptive field networks, we improve considerably over unstructured CNNs for small and medium dataset scenarios as well as over Scattering for large datasets. We validate our findings on ILSVRC2012, Cifar-10, Cifar-100 and MNIST. As a realistic small dataset example, we show state-of-the-art classification results on popular 3D MRI brain-disease datasets where pre-training is difficult due to a lack of large public datasets in a similar domain.",

        "abstract": "Visual recognition research often assumes a sufficient resolution of the region of interest (ROI). That is usually violated in practice, inspiring us to explore the Very Low Resolution Recognition (VLRR) problem. Typically, the ROI in a VLRR problem can be smaller than 16 x16 pixels, and is challenging to be recognized even by human experts. We attempt to solve the VLRR problem using deep learning methods. Taking advantage of techniques primarily in super resolution, domain adaptation and robust regression, we formulate a dedicated deep learning method and demonstrate how these techniques are incorporated step by step. Any extra complexity, when introduced, is fully justified by both analysis and simulation results. The resulting Robust Partially Coupled Networks achieves feature enhancement and recognition simultaneously. It allows for both the flexibility to combat the LR-HR domain mismatch, and the robustness to outliers. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed models is evaluated on three different VLRR tasks, including face identification, digit recognition and font recognition, all of which obtain very impressive performances.",

Our method can be interpreted as a sublabel-accurate solution to multilabel problems. We show that previously proposed functional lifting methods optimize an energy which is linear between two labels and hence require (often infinitely) many labels for a faithful approximation. In contrast, the proposed formulation is based on a piecewise convex approximation and therefore needs far fewer labels - see Fig. 1. In comparison to recent MRF-based approaches, our method is formulated in a spatially continuous setting and shows less grid bias. Moreover, in a local sense, our formulation is the tightest possible convex relaxation. It is easy to implement and allows an efficient primal-dual optimization on GPUs. We show the effectiveness of our approach on several computer vision problems.",

Our main result shows that this problem  can be formulated as a convex semi-definite optimization problem subject to an additional  rank constrain that involves only a very small number of variables.  This is established by first reducing the problem to a (generically non-convex) quadratically constrained quadratic problem and then using its special sparse structure to find conditions guaranteeing that a suitably built convex relaxation is indeed exact.  When combined with the commonly used nuclear norm relaxation for rank, the results above lead to computationally efficient algorithms with optimality guarantees. A salient feature of the proposed approach is its ability to incorporate existing a-priori information about the noise,  co-ocurrences, and percentage of outliers. These results are illustrated  with several examples where the proposed algorithm is shown to outperform existing approaches.",

We show how to extend our method to exploit semantic side information about the video's category/genre to guide the transfer process by those training videos semantically consistent with the test input. We also show how to generalize our method to subshot-based summarization, which not only reduces computational costs but also provides more flexible ways of defining visual similarity across subshots spanning several frames.

Our approach simultaneously learns feature selection that linearly transforms the database points into a low-dimensional discriminative subspace, and quantizes the data points in the transformed space. The optimization criterion is that the quantized points not only approximate the transformed points accurately, but also are semantically separable: the points belonging to a class lie in a cluster that is not overlapped with other clusters corresponding to other classes, which is formulated as a classification problem. The experiments on several standard datasets show the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the art supervised hashing and unsupervised quantization algorithms.",

By leveraging a comprehensive user interface, we collected more than 78,000 symmetry labels from 400 Amazon Mechanical Turk raters on nearly 1,000 photos from the Microsoft COCO dataset. Using a set of ground-truth symmetries automatically generated from noisy human labels, the effectiveness of our work is evidenced by a separate test where over 96% success rate is achieved.

We propose to tackle this problem from the perspective of manifold learning. Our main idea is to align the semantic space that is derived from external information to the model space that concerns itself with recognizing visual features. To this end, we introduce a set of \"phantom\" object classes whose coordinates live in both the semantic space and the model space. Serving as bases in a dictionary, they can be optimized from labeled data such that the synthesized real object classifiers achieve optimal discriminative performance. We demonstrate superior accuracy of our approach over the state of the art on four benchmark datasets for zero-shot learning, including the full ImageNet Fall 2011 dataset with more than 20,000 unseen classes.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a new method for text detection in natural images. The method comprises two contributions: First, a fast and scalable engine to generate synthetic images of text in clutter.  This engine overlays synthetic text to existing background images in a natural way, accounting for the local 3D scene geometry. Second, we use the synthetic images to train a Fully-Convolutional Regression Network (FCRN) which efficiently performs text detection and bounding-box regression at all locations and multiple scales in an image. We discuss the relation of FCRN to the recently-introduced YOLO detector, as well as other end-to-end object detection systems based on deep learning. The resulting detection network significantly out performs current methods for text detection in natural images, achieving an F-measure of 84.2% on the standard ICDAR 2013 benchmark. Furthermore, it can process 15 images per second on a GPU.",

        "abstract": "With the recent popularity of animated GIFs on social media, there is need for ways to index them with rich metadata. To advance research on animated GIF understanding, we collected a new dataset, Tumblr GIF (TGIF), with 100K animated GIFs from Tumblr and 120K natural language descriptions obtained via crowdsourcing. The motivation for this work is to develop a testbed for image sequence description systems, where the task is to generate natural language descriptions for animated GIFs or video clips. To ensure a high quality dataset, we developed a series of novel quality controls to validate free-form text input from crowdworkers. We show that there is unambiguous association between visual content and natural language descriptions in our dataset, making it an ideal benchmark for the visual content captioning task. We perform extensive statistical analyses to compare our dataset to existing image and video description datasets. Next, we provide baseline results on the animated GIF description task, using three representative techniques: nearest neighbor, statistical machine translation, and recurrent neural networks. Finally, we show that models fine-tuned from our animated GIF description dataset can be helpful for automatic movie description.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a deep neural network topology that incorporates a simple to implement transformation-invariant pooling operator (TI-pooling). This operator is able to efficiently handle prior knowledge on nuisance variations in the data, such as rotation or scale changes. Most current methods usually make use of dataset augmentation to address this issue, but this requires larger number of model parameters and more training data, and results in significantly increased training time and larger chance of under- or overfitting. The main reason for these drawbacks is that that the learned model needs to capture adequate features for all the possible transformations of the input. On the other hand, we formulate features in convolutional neural networks to be transformation-invariant. We achieve that using parallel siamese architectures for the considered transformation set and applying the TI-pooling operator on their outputs before the fully-connected layers. We show that this topology internally finds the most optimal \"canonical\" instance of the input image for training and therefore limits the redundancy in learned features. This more efficient use of training data results in better performance on popular benchmark datasets with smaller number of parameters when comparing to standard convolutional neural networks with dataset augmentation and to other baselines.",

Automatically locating and classifying the relevant action segments in videos of varying lengths proves to be a challenging task. We propose a novel method for temporal action detection including statistical length and language modeling to represent temporal and contextual structure. Our approach aims at globally optimizing the joint probability of three components, a length and language model and a discriminative action model, without making intermediate decisions. The problem of finding the most likely action sequence and the corresponding segment boundaries in an exponentially large search space is addressed by dynamic programming.  We provide an extensive evaluation of each model component on Thumos 14, a large action detection dataset, and report state-of-the-art results on three datasets.",

This application focuses on detecting and labeling actions in untrimmed videos, which brings more challenge than classifying pre-segmented videos. The major difficulty for action localization is the uncertainty of action occurrence and utilization of information from different scales. Two innovations are proposed to address this issue. First, we propose a Pyramid of Score Distribution Feature (PSDF) to capture the motion information at multiple resolutions centered at each detection window. This novel feature mitigates the influence of unknown action position and duration, and shows significant performance gain over previous detection approaches. Second, inter-frame consistency is further explored by incorporating PSDF into the state-of-the-art Recurrent Neural Networks, which gives additional performance gain in detecting actions in temporally untrimmed videos. We tested our action localization framework on the THUMOS'15 and MPII Cooking Activities Dataset, both of which show a large performance improvement over previous attempts.",

        "abstract": "We address temporal action localization in untrimmed long videos. This is important because videos in real applications are usually unconstrained and contain multiple action instances plus video content of background scenes or other activities. To address this challenging issue, we exploit the effectiveness of deep networks in temporal action localization via three segment-based 3D ConvNets: (1) a proposal network identifies candidate segments in a long video that may contain actions; (2) a classification network learns one-vs-all action classification model to serve as initialization for the localization network; and (3) a localization network fine-tunes the learned classification network to localize each action instance. We propose a novel loss function for the localization network to explicitly consider temporal overlap and achieve high temporal localization accuracy. In the end, only the proposal network and the localization network are used during prediction. On two large-scale benchmarks, our approach achieves significantly superior performances compared with other state-of-the-art systems: mAP increases from 1.7% to 7.4% on MEXaction2 and increases from 15.0% to 19.0% on THUMOS 2014.",

Finding the corresponding moving features in each of the images allows us to extract information about objects of interest in the scene. Computing correspondence of moving features in such a set of images is considerably more challenging than computing correspondence in video due to possible significant differences in viewpoints and inconsistent timing between image captures. The prediction methods used in video for improving robustness and efficiency are not applicable to a set of still images. In this paper we propose a novel method to predict locations of an approximately linear moving feature point, given a small subset of correspondences and the temporal order of image captures. Our method extends the use of epipolar geometry to divide images into valid and invalid regions, termed Temporal Epipolar Regions (TERs). We formally prove that the location of a feature in a new image is restricted to valid TERs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in reducing the search space for correspondence on both synthetic and challenging real world data, and show the improved matching.",

Recently, audiovisual speech recognition based the MRBM has attracted much attention, and the MRBM shows its effectiveness in learning the joint representation across audiovisual modalities. However, the built networks have weakness in modeling the multimodal sequence which is the natural property of speech signal. In this paper, we will introduce a novel temporal multimodal deep learning architecture, named as Recurrent Temporal Multimodal RBM (RTMRBM), that models multimodal sequences by transforming the sequence of connected MRBMs into a probabilistic series model. Compared with existing multimodal networks, it's simple and efficient in learning temporal joint representation. We evaluate our model on audiovisual speech datasets, two public (AVLetters and AVLetters2) and one self-build. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can obviously improve the accuracy of recognition compared with standard MRBM and the temporal model based on conditional RBM. In addition, RTMRBM still outperforms non-temporal multimodal deep networks in the presence of the weakness of long-term dependencies.",

No prior knowledge is required of scene structure or camera calibration allowing reconstruction from multiple moving cameras. Sparse-to-dense temporal correspondence is integrated with joint multi-view segmentation and reconstruction to obtain a complete 4D representation of static and dynamic objects. Temporal coherence is exploited to overcome visual ambiguities resulting in improved reconstruction of complex scenes. Robust joint segmentation and reconstruction of dynamic objects is achieved by introducing a geodesic star convexity constraint. Comparative evaluation is performed on a variety of unstructured indoor and outdoor dynamic scenes with hand-held cameras and multiple people. This demonstrates reconstruction of complete temporally coherent 4D scene models with improved non-rigid object segmentation and shape reconstruction.",

        "abstract": "The conventional sparse model relies on data representation in the form of vectors. It represents the vector-valued or vectorized one dimensional (1D) version of an signal as a highly sparse linear combination of basis atoms from a large dictionary. The 1D modeling, though simple, ignores the inherent structure and breaks the local correlation inside multidimensional (MD) signals. It also dramatically increases the demand of memory as well as computational resources especially when dealing with high dimensional signals. In this paper, we propose a new sparse model TenSR based on tensor for MD data representation along with the corresponding MD sparse coding and MD dictionary learning algorithms. The proposed TenSR model is able to well approximate the structure in each mode inherent in MD signals with a series of adaptive separable structure dictionaries via dictionary learning. The proposed MD sparse coding algorithm by proximal method further reduces the computational cost significantly. Experimental results with real world MD signals, i.e. 3D Multi-spectral images, show the proposed TenSR greatly reduces both the computational and memory costs with competitive performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art sparse representation methods. We believe our proposed TenSR model is a promising way to empower the sparse representation especially for large scale high order signals.",

        "abstract": "Due to its wide range of applications, matching between two graphs has been extensively studied and remains an active topic. By contrast, it is still under-exploited on how to jointly match multiple graphs, partly due to its intrinsic computational intractability. In this work, we address this challenging problem in a principled way under the rank-1 tensor approximation framework. In particular, we formulate multi-graph matching as a combinational optimization problem with two main ingredients: unary matching over graph vertices and structure matching over graph edges, both of which across multiple graphs. Then we propose an efficient power iteration solution for the resulted NP-hard optimization problem. The proposed algorithm has several advantages: 1) the intrinsic matching consistency across multiple graphs based on the high-order tensor optimization; 2) the free employment of powerful high-order node affinity; 3) the flexible integration between various types of node affinities and edge/hyper-edge affinities. Experiments on diverse and challenging datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison with state-of-the-arts.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies the Tensor Robust Principal Component (TRPCA) problem which extends the known Robust PCA to the tensor case. Our model is based on a new tensor Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD)  and its induced tensor tubal rank and tensor nuclear norm. Consider that we have a 3-way tensor X in R^n*n*n_3 such that X=L_0+S_0, where  L_0 has low tubal rank and S_0 is sparse. Is that possible to recover both components? In this work, we prove that under certain suitable assumptions, we can recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by simply solving a convex program  whose objective is a weighted combination of the tensor nuclear norm and the l1-norm, i.e.,  min L,E s.t. ||L||_*+lambda||E||_1 s.t. X=L+E. where lambda=1/sqrtmax(n_1,n_2)n_3. Interestingly, TRPCA involves RPCA as a special case when n_3=1 and thus it is a simple and elegant tensor extension of RPCA. Also numerical experiments verify our theory and the application for the image denoising demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.",

Object detection has benefited enormously from large-scale datasets, especially in the context of deep learning. For semantic urban scene understanding, however, no current dataset adequately captures the complexity of real-world urban scenes.  To address this, we introduce Cityscapes, a benchmark suite and large-scale dataset to train and test approaches for pixel-level and instance-level semantic labeling. Cityscapes is comprised of a large, diverse set of stereo video sequences recorded in streets from 50 different cities. 5000 of these images have high quality pixel-level annotations; 20000 additional images have coarse annotations to enable methods that leverage large volumes of weakly-labeled data. Crucially, our effort exceeds previous attempts in terms of dataset size, annotation richness, scene variability, and complexity. Our accompanying empirical study provides an in-depth analysis of the dataset characteristics, as well as a performance evaluation of several state-of-the-art approaches based on our benchmark.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel extremely efficient, fully-parallelizable, task-specific algorithm for the computation of global point-wise correspondences in images and videos. Our algorithm, the Global Patch Collider, is based on detecting unique collisions between image points using a collection of learned tree structures that act as conditional hash functions. In contrast to conventional approaches that rely on pairwise distance computation, our algorithm isolates distinctive pixel pairs that hit the same leaf during traversal through multiple learned tree structures. The split functions stored at the intermediate nodes of the trees are trained to ensure that only visually similar patches or their geometric or photometric transformed versions fall into the same leaf node. The matching process involves passing all pixel positions in the images under analysis through the tree structures. We then compute matches by isolating points that uniquely collide with each other  ie. fell in the same empty leaf in multiple trees. Our algorithm is linear in the number of pixels but can be made constant time on a parallel computation architecture as the tree traversal for individual image points is decoupled. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by using it to perform optical flow matching and stereo matching on some challenging benchmarks. Experimental results show that not only is our method extremely computationally efficient, but it is also able to match or outperform state of the art methods that are much more complex.",

        "abstract": "To image in high resolution large and occlusion-prone scenes, a camera must move above and around. Degradation of visibility due to geometric occlusions and distances is exacerbated by scattering, when the scene is in a participating medium. Moreover, underwater and in other media, artificial lighting is needed. Overall, data quality depends on the observed surface, medium and the time-varying poses of the camera and light source. This work proposes to optimize camera and light poses as they move, so that the surface is scanned efficiently and the descattered recovery has the highest quality. The work generalizes the next best view concept of robot vision to scattering media and cooperative movable lighting. It also extends descattering to platforms that move optimally. The optimization criterion is information gain, taken from information theory. We exploit the existence of a prior rough 3D model, since underwater such a model is routinely obtained using sonar. We demonstrate this principle in a scaled-down setup.",

        "abstract": "Vision-based semantic segmentation in urban scenarios is a key functionality for autonomous driving. Recent revolutionary results of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) foreshadow the advent of reliable classifiers to perform such visual tasks. However, DCNNs require learning of many parameters from raw images; thus, having a sufficient amount of diverse images with class annotations is needed. These annotations are obtained via cumbersome, human labour which is particularly challenging for semantic segmentation since pixel-level annotations are required. In this paper, we propose to use a virtual world to automatically generate realistic synthetic images with pixel-level annotations. Then, we address the question of how useful such data can be for  semantic segmentation -- in particular, when using a DCNN paradigm. In order to answer this question we have generated a synthetic collection of diverse urban images, named SYNTHIA, with automatically generated class annotations. We use SYNTHIA in combination with publicly available real-world urban images with manually provided annotations. Then, we conduct experiments with DCNNs that show how the inclusion of SYNTHIA in the training stage significantly improves performance on the semantic segmentation task.",

Our tracker not only produces identity-coherent trajectories based on cues such as face recognition, but also has the ability to pinpoint potential tracking errors. The tracker is formulated as a quadratic optimization problem with L0 norm constraints, which we propose to solve with the solution path algorithm. The algorithm successively solves the same optimization problem but under different Lp norm constraints, where p gradually decreases from 1 to 0. Inspired by the success of the solution path algorithm in various machine learning tasks, this strategy is expected to converge to a better local minimum than directly minimizing the hardly solvable L0 norm or the roughly approximated L1 norm constraints. Furthermore, the acquired solution path complies with the \"decision making process\" of the tracker, which provides more insight to locating potential tracking errors. Experiments show that not only is our proposed tracker effective, but also the solution path enables automatic pinpointing of potential tracking failures, which can be readily utilized in an active learning framework to improve identity-aware multi-object tracking.",

Since ACs enable to estimate models from fewer correspondences, its use can dramatically reduce the number of combinations during the iterative step of sample-and-test that exists in most SfM pipelines. However, using ACs instead of PCs as input for SfM passes by fully understanding the relations between ACs and multi-view geometry, as well as by establishing practical, effective AC-based algorithms. This article is a step forward into this direction, by providing a clear account about how ACs constrain the two-view geometry, and by proposing new algorithms for plane segmentation and visual odometry that compare favourably with respect to methods relying in PCs.",

However, state-of-the-art performance degrades dramatically when the number of positive training exemplars falls short. Since label acquisition is costly, laborious, and time-consuming, there is a real need to consider the much more challenging semantic event search problem, where no  example video is given. In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art event search system without any example videos. Relying on the key observation that events (e.g. dog show) are usually compositions of multiple mid-level concepts (e.g. \"dog,\" \"theater,\" and \"dog jumping\"), we first train a skip-gram model to measure the relevance of each concept with the event of interest. The relevant concept classifiers then cast votes on the test videos but their reliability, due to lack of labeled training videos, has been largely unaddressed. We propose to combine the concept classifiers based on a principled estimate of their accuracy on the unlabeled test videos. A novel warping technique is proposed to improve the performance and an efficient highly-scalable algorithm is provided to quickly solve the resulting optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on the latest TRECVID MEDTest 2014, MEDTest 2013 and CCV datasets, and achieve state-of-the-art performances.",

RGB-D images are traditionally described by local geometric features of the 3D point cloud. We propose a cloud of oriented gradient (COG) descriptor that links the 2D appearance and 3D pose of object categories, and thus accurately models how perspective projection affects perceived image boundaries. We also propose a \"Manhattan voxel\" representation which better captures the 3D room layout geometry of common indoor environments.  Effective classification rules are learned via a structured prediction framework that accounts for the intersection-over-union overlap of hypothesized 3D cuboids with human annotations, as well as orientation estimation errors. Contextual relationships among categories and layout are captured via a cascade of classifiers, leading to holistic scene hypotheses with improved accuracy. Our model is learned solely from annotated RGB-D images, without the benefit of CAD models, but nevertheless its performance substantially exceeds the state-of-the-art on the SUN RGB-D database. Avoiding CAD models allows easier learning of detectors for many object categories.",

        "abstract": "Most existing person re-identification (re-id) models focus on matching still person images across disjoint camera views using the setting of either single-shot or multi-shot. Since limited information can be exploited from still images, it is hard (if not impossible) to overcome the occlusion, pose and camera-view change, and lighting variation problems. In comparison, video-based re-id methods can utilize extra space-time information, which contains much more rich cues for matching to overcome the mentioned problems. However, in this work, we find that when using video-based representation, some inter-class difference can be much more obscure than the one when using still-image-based representation, because different people could not only have similar appearance but also may have similar motions and actions which are hard to align. To solve this problem, we propose a top-push distance learning model (TDL), in which we integrate a top-push constrain, for matching video features of persons. The top-push constraint enforces the optimization on top-rank matching in re-id, so as to make the matching model more effective towards selecting more discriminative features to distinguish different persons.

        "abstract": "Deep networks have produced significant gains for various visual recognition problems, leading to high impact academic and commercial applications.  Recent work in deep networks highlighted that it is easy to generate images that humans would never classify as a particular object class, yet networks classify such images high confidence as that given class - deep network are easily fooled with images humans do not consider meaningful.  The closed set nature of deep networks forces them to choose from one of the known classes leading to such artifacts.  Recognition in the real world is open set, i.e. the recognition system should reject unknown/unseen classes at test time. We present a methodology to adapt deep networks for open set recognition, by introducing a new model layer, OpenMax, which estimates the probability of an input being from an unknown class.  A key element of estimating the unknown probability is adapting Meta-Recognition concepts to the activation patterns in the penultimate layer of the network. OpenMax allows rejection of \"fooling\" and unrelated open set images presented to the system; OpenMax greatly reduces the number of  obvious errors made by a deep network.  We prove that the OpenMax concept provides bounded open space risk, thereby formally providing an open set recognition solution. We evaluate the resulting open set deep networks using pre-trained networks from the Caffe Model-zoo on ImageNet 2012 validation data, and thousands of fooling and open set images. The proposed OpenMax model significantly outperforms open set recognition accuracy of basic deep networks as well as deep networks with thresholding of SoftMax probabilities.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an algorithm that allows to learn low dimensional representations of images in an unsupervised manner. The core idea is to combine two criteria that play important roles in unsupervised representation learning, namely sparsity and trace quotient. The former is known to be a convenient tool to identify underlying factors, and the latter is known as a disentanglement of underlying discriminative factors. In this work, we develop a generic cost function for learning jointly a sparsifying dictionary and a dimensionality reduction transformation. It leads to several counterparts of classic low dimensional representation methods, such as Principal Component Analysis, Local Linear Embedding, and Laplacian Eigenmap. Our proposed optimisation algorithm leverages the efficiency of geometric optimisation on Riemannian manifolds and a closed form solution to the elastic net problem.",

In contrast to previous unsupervised methods that either track regions initialized in an arbitrary frame or train a fixed model over a cluster of regions, we instead discover a set of easy-to-group instances of an object and then iteratively update its appearance model to gradually detect harder instances in temporally-adjacent frames.  Our method first generates a set of spatio-temporal bounding box proposals, and then refines them to obtain pixel-wise segmentation proposals.  Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate state-of-the-art segmentation results on the SegTrack v2 dataset, and bounding box tracking results that perform competitively to state-of-the-art supervised tracking methods.",

Our framework takes a markedly different direction: we transfer tracked object boxes from weakly-labeled videos to weakly-labeled images to automatically generate pseudo ground-truth boxes, which replace manually annotated bounding boxes.  We first mine discriminative regions in the weakly-labeled image collection that frequently/rarely appear in the positive/negative images.  We then match those regions to videos and retrieve the corresponding tracked object boxes.  Finally, we design a hough transform algorithm to vote for the best box to serve as the pseudo GT for each image, and use them to train an object detector.  Together, these lead to state-of-the-art weakly-supervised detection results on the PASCAL 2007 and 2010 datasets.",

        "abstract": "Although promising results have been achieved in the areas of traffic-sign detection and classification, few works have provided simultaneous solutions to these two tasks for realistic real world images. We make two contributions to this problem. Firstly, we have created a large traffic-sign benchmark from 100000 Tencent Street View panoramas,      going beyond previous benchmarks. It provides 100000 images containing 30000 traffic-sign instances. These  images cover large variations in illuminance and weather conditions.  Each traffic-sign in the benchmark is annotated with a class label, its bounding box and pixel mask. We call this benchmark Tsinghua-Tencent 100K. Secondly, we demonstrate how a robust end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) can simultaneously detect and classify traffic-signs. Most previous CNN image processing solutions target objects that occupy a large proportion of an image, and such networks do not work well for target objects occupying only a small fraction of an image like the traffic-signs here. Experimental results show the robustness of our network and its superiority to alternatives. The benchmark, source code and the CNN model introduced in this paper is publicly available.",

We present a simple yet surprisingly effective online hard example mining (OHEM) algorithm for training region-based ConvNet detectors. Our motivation is the same as it has always been -- detection datasets contain an overwhelming number of easy examples and a small number of hard examples. Automatic selection of these hard examples can make training more effective and efficient. OHEM is a simple and intuitive algorithm that eliminates several heuristics and hyperparameters in common use. But more importantly, it yields consistent and significant boosts in detection performance on benchmarks like PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012. Its effectiveness increases as datasets become larger and more difficult, as demonstrated by the results on the MS COCO dataset. Moreover, combined with complementary advances in the field, OHEM leads to state-of-the-art results of 78.9% and 76.3% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 respectively.",

Low-rank matrix factorization is an essential problem in many areas including computer vision, with applications in e.g. affine structure-from-motion, photometric stereo, and non-rigid structure from motion. We specifically target structured data patterns, with outliers and large amounts of missing data. Using recently developed characterizations of minimal solutions to matrix factorization problems with missing data, we show how these can be used as building blocks in a hierarchical system that performs bootstrapping on all levels.

        "abstract": "This paper examines the problem of white-balance correction when a scene contains two illuminations.  This is a two step process: 1) estimate the two illuminants; and 2) correct the image.   Existing methods attempt to estimate a spatially varying illumination map, however, results are error prone and the resulting illumination maps are too low-resolution to be used for proper spatially varying white-balance correction.  In addition, the spatially varying nature of these methods make them computationally intensive.   We show that this problem can be effectively addressed by not attempting to obtain a spatially varying illumination map, but instead by performing illumination estimation on large sub-regions of the image.   Our approach is able to detect when distinct illuminations are present in the image and accurately measure these illuminants.   Since our proposed strategy is not suitable for spatially varying image correction, a user study is performed to see if there is a preference for how the image should be corrected when two illuminants are present, but only a global correction can be applied.   The user study shows that when the illuminations are distinct, there is a preference for the outdoor illumination to be corrected resulting in warmer final result.  We use these collective findings to demonstrate an effective two illuminant estimation scheme that produces corrected images that users prefer.",

This work is part of a fully autonomous UAV system which can maneuver to face a single individual in challenging outdoor environments. Our body orientation estimation consists of the following steps: (a) obtaining a set of visual appearance models for each body orientation, where each model is tagged with a set of scene information (obtained from sensors); (b) exploiting the mutual information of on-board sensors using latent-dynamic conditional random fields (LDCRF); (c) Characterizing each visual appearance model with the most discriminative sensor information; (d) fast estimation of body orientation during the test flights given the LDCRF parameters and the corresponding sensor readings. The key aspects of our approach is to add sparsity to the sensor readings with latent variables followed by long range dependency analysis. Experimental results obtained over real-time video streams demonstrate a significant improvement in both speed (15-fps) and accuracy (72%) compared to the state of the art techniques that only rely on visual data. Video demonstration of our autonomous flights (both from ground view and aerial view) are included in the supplementary material.",

        "abstract": "3D shape recovery using photometric stereo (PS) gained increasing attention in the computer vision community in the last three decades due to its ability to recover the thinnest geometric structures. Yet, the reliabiliy of PS for color images is difficult to guarantee, because existing methods are usually formulated as the sequential estimation of the colored albedos, the normals and the depth. Hence, the overall reliability depends on that of each subtask. In this work we propose a new formulation of color photometric stereo, based on image ratios, that makes the technique independent from the albedos. This allows the unbiased 3D-reconstruction of colored surfaces in a single step, by solving a system of linear PDEs using a variational approach.",

We propose a model that represents various isotropic reflectance functions by using the principal components of items in a dataset, and formulate the uncalibrated photometric stereo as a regression problem.  We then solve it by stepwise optimization utilizing principal components in order of their importance.   We have also developed two techniques that lead to convergence and highly accurate reconstruction, namely (1) a coarse-to-fine approach with normal grouping, and (2) a randomized multipoint search. Our experimental results with synthetic data showed that our method significantly outperformed previous methods.

        "abstract": "In recent years, the task of estimating the 6D pose of object instances and complete scenes, i.e. camera localization, from a single input image has received considerable attention. Consumer RGB-D cameras have made this feasible, even for difficult, texture-less objects and scenes. In this work, we show that a single RGB image is sufficient to achieve visually convincing results. Our key concept is to model and exploit the uncertainty of the system at all stages of the processing pipeline. The uncertainty comes in the form of continuous distributions over 3D object coordinates and discrete distributions over object labels. We give three technical contributions. Firstly, we develop a regularized, auto-context regression framework which iteratively reduces uncertainty in object coordinate and object label predictions. Secondly, we introduce an efficient way to marginalize object coordinate distributions over depth. This is necessary to deal with missing depth information. Thirdly, we utilize the distributions over object labels to detect multiple objects simultaneously with a fixed budget of RANSAC hypotheses. We tested our system for object pose estimation and camera localization on commonly used data sets. We see a major improvement over competing systems.",

In our unconstrained problem, we need to deal with large shape and appearance variations under extreme head poses and rich shape deformation. To equip cascaded regressors with the capability to handle global shape variation and irregular appearance-shape relation in the unconstrained scenario, we partition the optimisation space into multiple domains of homogeneous descent, and predict a shape as a composition of estimations from multiple domain-specific regressors. With a specially formulated learning objective and a novel tree splitting function, our approach is capable of estimating a robust and meaningful composition. In addition to achieving state-of-the-art accuracy over existing approaches, our framework is also an efficient solution (350 FPS), thanks to the on-the-fly domain exclusion mechanism and the capability of leveraging the fast pixel feature.",

It is unsupervised in the sense that the target dataset is completely unlabelled.

The contributions of this paper are three-fold. First, we develop a new unsupervised learning approach that takes advantage of the complementary nature of the input video and the associated narration. The method solves two clustering problems, one in text and one in video, applied one after each other and linked by joint constraints to obtain a single coherent sequence of steps in both modalities. Second, we collect and annotate a new challenging dataset of real-world instruction videos from the Internet. The dataset contains about 800,000 frames for five different tasks that include complex interactions between people and objects, and are captured in a variety of indoor and outdoor settings. Third, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method can automatically discover, in an unsupervised manner, the main steps to achieve the task and locate the steps in the input videos.",

        "abstract": "Attributes offer useful mid-level features to interpret visual data. While most attribute learning methods are supervised by costly human-generated labels, we introduce a simple yet powerful unsupervised approach to learn and predict visual attributes directly from data. Given a large unlabeled image collection as input, we train deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to output a set of discriminative, binary attributes often with semantic meanings. Specifically, we first train a CNN coupled with unsupervised discriminative clustering, and then use the cluster membership as a soft supervision to discover shared attributes from the clusters while maximizing their separability. The learned attributes are shown to be capable of encoding rich imagery properties from both natural images and contour patches. The visual representations learned in this way are also transferrable to other tasks such as object detection. We show other convincing results on the related tasks of image retrieval and classification, and contour detection.",

        "abstract": "Data-driven approaches for edge detection have proven effective and achieve top results on modern benchmarks. However, all current data-driven edge detectors require manual supervision for training in the form of hand-labeled region segments or object boundaries. Specifically, human annotators mark semantically meaningful edges which are subsequently used for training. Is this form of strong, high-level supervision actually necessary to learn to accurately detect edges? In this work we present a simple yet effective approach for training edge detectors without human supervision. To this end we utilize motion, and more specifically, the only input to our method is noisy semi-dense matches between frames. We begin with only a rudimentary knowledge of edges (in the form of image gradients), and alternate between improving motion estimation and edge detection in turn. Using a large corpus of video data, we show that edge detectors trained using our unsupervised scheme approach the performance of the same methods trained with full supervision (within 3-5%). Finally, we show that when using a deep network for the edge detector, our approach provides a novel pre-training scheme for object detection.",

However, acquiring the necessary training data is typically a tedious and time consuming task that involves manual interaction, active sensing devices and/or synthetic scenes. To overcome this problem, we propose a new, flexible, and scalable way for generating training data that only requires a set of stereo images as input. The key idea of our approach is to use different view points for reasoning about contradictions and consistencies between multiple depth maps generated with the same stereo algorithm. This enables us to generate a huge amount of training data in a fully automated manner. Among other experiments, we demonstrate the potential of our approach by boosting the performance of three learned confidence measures on the KITTI2012 dataset by simply training them on a vast amount of automatically generated training data rather than a limited amount of laser ground truth data.",

        "abstract": "Correctly matching feature points in a pair of images is an important preprocessing step for many computer vision applications. In this paper we propose an efficient method for estimating the number of correct matches without explicitly computing them. In addition, our method estimates the region of overlap between the images. To this end, we propose to analyze the set of matches using the spatial order of the features, as projected to the x-axis of the image. The set of features in each image is thus represented by a sequence. This reduces the analysis of the matching problem to the analysis of the permutation between the sequences. Using the Kendall distance metric between permutations and natural assumptions on the distribution of the correct and incorrect matches, we show how to estimate the above-mentioned values. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method in two applications: (i) a new halting condition for RANSAC based epipolar geometry estimation methods that considerably reduce the running time, and (ii) discarding spatially unrelated image pairs in the Structure-from-Motion pipeline. Furthermore, our analysis allows to compute the probability that a given match is correct based on the estimated number of correct matches and the rank of the features within the sequences. Our experiments on a large number of synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. For example, the running time of the image matching stage in the Structure-from-Motion pipeline may be reduced by about 99% while preserving about 80% of the correctly matched feature points.",

However, such information is important for the accurate recognition of actions, especially for the discrimination of complex activities that share sub-actions, and when dealing with untrimmed videos. Here, we propose a representation, VLAD for Deep Dynamics (VLAD^3), that accounts for different levels of video dynamics. It captures short-term dynamics with deep convolutional neural network features, relying on linear dynamic systems (LDS) to model medium-range dynamics. To account for long-range inhomogeneous dynamics, a VLAD descriptor is derived for the LDS and pooled over the whole video, to arrive at the final VLAD^3 representation. An extensive evaluation was performed on Olympic Sports, UCF101 and THUMOS15, where the use of the VLAD^3 representation leads to state-of- the-art results.",

Our hierarchical framework contains a sentence generator and a paragraph generator. The sentence generator produces one simple short sentence that describes a specific short video interval. It exploits both temporal- and spatial-attention mechanisms to selectively focus on visual elements during generation. The paragraph generator captures the inter-sentence dependency by taking as input the sentential embedding produced by the sentence generator, combining it with the paragraph history, and outputting the new initial state for the sentence generator. We evaluate our approach on two large-scale benchmark datasets: YouTubeClips and TACoS-MultiLevel.

Optical flow can be used to propagate an object segmentation over time but, unfortunately, flow is often inaccurate, particularly around object boundaries. Such boundaries are precisely where we want our segmentation to be accurate. To obtain accurate segmentation across time, we propose an efficient algorithm that considers video segmentation and optical flow estimation simultaneously. For video segmentation, we formulate a principled, multi-scale, spatio-temporal objective function that uses optical flow to propagate information between frames. For optical flow estimation, particularly at object boundaries, we compute the flow independently in the segmented regions and recompose the results. We call the process object flow and demonstrate the effectiveness of jointly optimizing optical flow and video segmentation using an iterative scheme. Experiments on the SegTrack v2 and Youtube-Objects datasets show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the other state-of-the-art methods.",

Inspired by plot analysis of written stories, our method generates a sequence of video clips ordered in such a way that it reflects plot dynamics and content coherency. That is, given a set of multiple video clips, our method composes a video which we call a video-story. We define metrics on scene dynamics and coherency by dense optical flow features and a patch matching algorithm. Using these metrics, we define an objective function for the video-story. To efficiently search for the best video-story, we introduce a novel Branch-and-Bound algorithm which guarantees the global optimum. We collect the dataset consisting of 23 video sets from the web, resulting in a total of 236 individual video clips. With the acquired dataset, we perform extensive user studies involving 30 human subjects by which the effectiveness of our approach is quantitatively and qualitatively verified.",

        "abstract": "We introduce the novel problem of automatically generating animated GIFs from video. GIFs are short looping video with no sound, and a perfect combination between image and video that really capture our attention. GIFs tell a story, express emotion, turn events into humorous moments, and are the new wave of photojournalism. We pose the question: Can we automate the entirely manual and elaborate process of GIF creation by leveraging the plethora of user generated GIF content? We propose a Robust Deep RankNet that, given a video, generates a ranked list of its segments according to their suitability as GIF. We train our model to learn what visual content is often selected for GIFs by using over 100K user generated GIFs and their corresponding video sources. We effectively deal with the noisy web data by proposing a novel adaptive Huber loss in the ranking formulation. We show that our approach is robust to outliers and picks up several patterns that are frequently present in popular animated GIFs. On our new large-scale benchmark dataset, we show the advantage of our approach over several state-of-the-art methods.",

In this work, we instead leverage the recent progress in computer graphics to generate fully labeled, dynamic, and photo-realistic proxy virtual worlds.  We propose an efficient real-to-virtual world cloning method, and validate our approach by building and publicly releasing a new video dataset, called Virtual KITTI, automatically labeled with accurate ground truth for object detection, tracking, scene and instance segmentation, depth, and optical flow.  We provide quantitative experimental evidence suggesting that (i) modern deep learning algorithms pre-trained on real data behave similarly in real and virtual worlds, and (ii) pre-training on virtual data improves performance.  As the gap between real and virtual worlds is small, virtual worlds enable measuring the impact of various weather and imaging conditions on recognition performance, all other things being equal.  We show these factors may affect drastically otherwise high-performing deep models for tracking.",

        "abstract": "We propose a model to learn visually grounded word embeddings (vis-w2v) to capture visual notions of semantic relatedness. While word embeddings trained using text have been extremely successful, they cannot uncover notions of semantic relatedness implicit in our visual world. For instance, although \"eats\" and \"stares at\" seem unrelated in text, they share semantics visually. When people are eating something, they also tend to stare at the food. Grounding diverse relations like \"eats\" and \"stares at\" into vision remains challenging, despite recent progress in vision. We note that the visual grounding of words depends on semantics, and not the literal pixels. We thus use abstract scenes created from clipart to provide the visual grounding. We find that the embeddings we learn capture fine-grained, visually grounded notions of semantic relatedness. We show improvements over text-only word embeddings (word2vec) on three tasks: common-sense assertion classification, visual paraphrasing and text-based image retrieval. Our code and datasets are available online.",

However, AI models still fail to match humans in high-level vision tasks due to the lack of capacities for deeper reasoning. Recently the new task of visual question answering (QA) has been proposed to evaluate a model's capacity for deep image understanding. Previous works have established a loose, global association between QA sentences and images. However, many questions and answers, in practice, relate to local regions in the images. We establish a semantic link between textual descriptions and image regions by object-level grounding. It enables a new type of QA with visual answers, in addition to textual answers used in previous work. We study the visual QA tasks in a grounded setting with a large collection of 7W multiple-choice QA pairs. Furthermore, we evaluate human performance and several baseline models on the QA tasks. Finally, we propose a novel LSTM model with spatial attention to tackle the 7W QA tasks.",

Nevertheless, it is still unclear how these mod- els represent texture and invariances to categorical variations. This work conducts a systematic evaluation of recent CNN-based texture descriptors for recognition and attempts to understand the nature of invariances captured by these representations. First we show that the recently proposed bilinear CNN model [25] is an excellent generalpurpose texture descriptor and compares favorably to other CNN-based descriptors on various texture and scene recognition benchmarks. The model is translationally invariant and obtains better accuracy on the ImageNet dataset without requiring spatial jittering of data compared to corresponding models trained with spatial jittering. Based on recent work [13, 28] we propose a technique to visualize pre-images, providing a means for understanding categorical properties that are captured by these representations. Finally, we show preliminary results on how a unified parametric model of texture analysis and synthesis can be used for attribute-based image manipulation, e.g. to make an image more swirly, honeycombed, or knitted.

We present an algorithm that synthesizes sound from silent videos of people hitting and scratching objects with a drumstick.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new framework for 3D tracking by detection based on fully volumetric representations. On one hand, 3D tracking by detection has shown robust use in the context of interaction (Kinect) and surface tracking. On the other hand, volumetric representations have recently been proven efficient both for building 3D features and for addressing the 3D tracking problem. We leverage these benefits by unifying both families of approaches into a single, fully volumetric tracking-by-detection framework. We use a centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) representation to compactly tessellate shapes with optimal discretization, construct a feature space, and perform the tracking according to the correspondences provided by trained random forests. Our results show improved tracking and training computational efficiency and improved memory performance. This in turn enables the use of larger training databases than state of the art approaches, which we leverage by proposing a cross-tracking subject training scheme to benefit from all subject sequences for all tracking situations, thus yielding better detection and less overfitting.",

        "abstract": "3D shape models are becoming widely available and easier to capture, making available 3D information crucial for progress in object classification. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on CNNs to address this problem. Recently, we witness two types of CNNs being developed: CNNs based upon volumetric representations versus CNNs based upon multi-view representations. Empirical results from these two types of CNNs exhibit a large gap, indicating that existing volumetric CNN architectures and approaches are unable to fully exploit the power of 3D representations. In this paper, we aim to improve both volumetric CNNs and multi-view CNNs according to extensive analysis of existing approaches. To this end, we introduce two distinct network architectures of volumetric CNNs. In addition, we examine multi-view CNNs, where we introduce multi-resolution filtering in 3D. Overall, we are able to outperform current state-of-the-art methods for both volumetric CNNs and multi-view CNNs. We provide extensive experiments designed to evaluate underlying design choices, thus providing a better understanding of the space of methods available for object classification on 3D data.",

We show that there is a gap between current face detection performance and the real world requirements. To facilitate future face detection research, we introduce the WIDER FACE dataset, which is 10 times larger than existing datasets. The dataset contains rich annotations, including occlusions, poses, event categories, and face bounding boxes. Faces in the proposed dataset are extremely challenging due to large variations in scale, pose and occlusion, as shown in Fig. 1. Furthermore, we show that WIDER FACE dataset is an effective training source for face detection. We benchmark several representative detection systems, providing an overview of state-of-the-art performance and propose a solution to deal with large scale variation. Finally, we discuss common failure cases that worth to be further investigated.",

        "abstract": "The way people look in terms of facial attributes (ethnicity, hair color, facial hair, etc.) and the clothes or accessories they wear (sunglasses, hat, hoodies, etc.) is highly dependent on geo-location and weather condition, respectively. This work explores, for the first time, the use of this contextual information, as people with wearable cameras walk across different neighborhoods of a city, in order to learn a rich feature representation for facial attribute classification, without the costly manual annotation required by previous methods. By tracking the faces of casual walkers on more than 40 hours of egocentric video, we are able to cover tens of thousands of different identities and automatically extract nearly 5 million pairs of images connected by or from different face tracks, along with their weather and location context, under pose and lighting variations. These image pairs are then fed into a deep network that preserves similarity of images connected by the same track, in order to capture identity-related attribute features, and optimizes for location and weather prediction to capture additional facial attribute features. Finally, the network is fine-tuned with manually annotated samples. We perform an extensive experimental analysis on wearable data and two standard benchmark datasets based on web images (LFWA and CelebA). Our method outperforms by a large margin a network trained from scratch. Moreover, even without using manually annotated identity labels for pre-training as in previous methods, our approach achieves results that are better than the state of the art.",

        "abstract": "We present an approach to matching images of objects in fine-grained datasets without using part annotations, with an application to the challenging problem of weakly supervised single-view reconstruction. This is in contrast to prior works that require part annotations, since matching objects across class and pose variations is challenging with appearance features alone. We overcome this challenge through a novel deep learning architecture, WarpNet, that aligns an object in one image with a different object in another. We exploit the structure of the fine-grained dataset to create artificial data for training this network in an unsupervised-discriminative learning approach. The output of the network acts as a spatial prior that allows generalization at test time to match real images across variations in appearance, viewpoint and articulation. On the CUB-200-2011 dataset of bird categories, we improve the AP over an appearance-only network by 13.6%. We further demonstrate that our WarpNet matches, together with the structure of fine-grained datasets, allow single-view reconstructions with quality comparable to using annotated point correspondences.",

As interactions between humans and AI systems increase, it is imperative that these systems are taught to understand subtleties of human expressions such as humor. In this work, we are interested in the question - what content in a scene causes it to be funny? As a first step towards understanding visual humor, we analyze the humor manifested in abstract scenes and design computational models for them. We collect two datasets of abstract scenes that facilitate the study of humor at both the scene-level and the object-level. We analyze the funny scenes and explore the different types of humor depicted in them via human studies. We model two tasks that we believe demonstrate an understanding of some aspects of visual humor. The tasks involve predicting the funniness of a scene and altering the funniness of a scene. We show that our models perform well quantitatively, and qualitatively through human studies. Our datasets are publicly available.",

        "abstract": "Training object class detectors typically requires a large set of images in which objects are annotated by bounding-boxes. However, manually drawing bounding-boxes is very time consuming. We propose a new scheme for training object detectors which only requires annotators to verify bounding-boxes produced automatically by the learning algorithm. Our scheme iterates between re-training the detector, re-localizing objects in the training images, and human verification. We use the verification signal both to improve re-training and to reduce the search space for re-localisation, which makes these steps different to what is normally done in a weakly supervised setting. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 show that (1) using human verification to update detectors and reduce the search space leads to the rapid production of high-quality bounding-box annotations; (2) our scheme delivers detectors performing almost as good as those trained in a fully supervised setting, without ever drawing any bounding-box; (3) as the verification task is very quick, our scheme substantially reduces total annotation time by a factor 6x-9x.",

In this paper, we address this problem by exploiting the power of deep convolutional neural networks pre-trained on large-scale image-level classification tasks. We propose a weakly supervised deep detection architecture that modifies one such network to operate at the level of image regions, performing simultaneously region selection and classification. Trained as an image classifier, the architecture implicitly learns object detectors that are better than alternative weakly supervised detection systems on the PASCAL VOC data. The model, which is a simple and elegant end-to-end architecture, outperforms standard data augmentation and fine-tuning techniques for the task of image-level classification as well.",

Since labelling object boundaries is one of the most expensive types of annotations, there is a need to relax the requirement to carefully annotate images to make both the training more affordable and to extend the amount of training data. In this paper we propose a technique to generate weakly supervised annotations and show that bounding box annotations alone suffice to reach high-quality object boundaries without using any object-specific boundary annotations. With the proposed weak supervision techniques we achieve the top performance on the object boundary detection task, outperforming by a large margin the current fully supervised state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of weakly supervised object localization where only image-level annotations are available for training. Many existing approaches tackle this problem through object proposal mining. However, a substantial amount of noise in object proposals causes ambiguities for learning discriminative object models. Such approaches are sensitive to model initialization and often converge to an undesirable local minimum. In this paper, we address this problem by progressive domain adaptation with two main steps: classification adaptation and detection adaptation. In classification adaptation, we transfer a pre-trained network to our multi-label classification task for recognizing the presence of a certain object in an image. In detection adaptation, we first use a mask-out strategy to collect class-specific object proposals and apply multiple instance learning to mine confident candidates. We then use these selected object proposals to fine-tune all the layers, resulting in a fully adapted detection network. We extensively evaluate the localization performance on the PASCAL VOC and ILSVRC datasets and demonstrate significant performance improvement over the state-of-the-art methods.",

Action is localized by employing images downloaded from internet using action name.  Given web images, we first mitigate image noise using random walk framework and evade distracting backgrounds within images using image action proposals. Then,  given a video, we generate multiple spatio-temporal action proposals. We suppress camera and background generated proposals by exploiting optical flow gradients within proposal. To obtain the most action representative proposal, we propose to reconstruct  action proposals in the video by leveraging the action proposal in images. Moreover, we preserve the temporal smoothness of the video by introducing consensus regularization. Consensus regularization enforces consistency among coefficients vectors of multiple frames within proposal. %We reconstruct video action proposals from image action proposals while enforcing consistency across coefficient vectors of multiple frames by consensus regularization.  Finally, the video proposal that have the lowest reconstruction cost and is motion salient is considered as final action localization. Our  extensive experiments on trimmed as well as untrimmed datasets validate the effectiveness of proposed approach.",

The proposed method learns the structure of the central view and uses this information to construct a light field dictionary for which groups of atoms correspond to unique disparities. This dictionary is then used to code a sparse representation of the light field. Analysing the coefficients of this representation with respect to the disparities of their corresponding atoms yields an accurate and robust estimate of depth. In addition, if the light field has multiple depth layers, such as for reflective or transparent surfaces, statistical analysis of the coefficients can be employed to infer the respective depth of the superimposed layers.",

This approach does not explicitly represent high-level semantic concepts, but rather seeks to progress directly from image features to text. In this paper we investigate whether this direct approach succeeds due to, or despite, the fact that it avoids the explicit representation of high-level information. We propose a method of incorporating high-level concepts into the successful CNN-RNN approach, and show that it achieves a significant improvement on the state-of-the-art in both image captioning and visual question answering. We also show that the same mechanism can be used to introduce external semantic information and that doing so further improves performance. We achieve the best reported results on both image captioning and VQA on several benchmark datasets, and provide an analysis of the value of explicit high-level concepts in V2L problems.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies the challenging problem of identifying unusual instances of known objects in images within an \"open world\" setting. That is, we aim to find objects that are members of a known class, but which are not typical of that class. Thus the \"unusual object\" should be distinguished from both the \"regular object\" and the \"other objects\". Such unusual objects may be of interest in many applications such as surveillance or quality control. We propose to identify unusual objects by inspecting the distribution of object detection scores at multiple image regions. The key observation motivating our approach is that \"regular object\" images, \"unusual object\" images and \"other objects\" images exhibit different region-level scores in terms of both the score values and the spatial distributions. To model these distributions we propose to use Gaussian Processes (GP) to construct two separate generative models, one for the \"regular object\" and the other for the \"other objects\". More specifically, we design a new covariance function to simultaneously model the detection score at a single location and the score dependencies between multiple regions. We demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms comparable methods on a new large dataset constructed for the purpose.",

        "abstract": "Since Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the leading learning paradigm in visual recognition, Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor (NBNN)-based classifiers have lost momentum in the community. This is because (1) such algorithms cannot use CNN activations as input features; (2) they cannot be used as final layer of CNN architectures for end-to-end training , and (3) they are generally not scalable and hence cannot handle big data. This paper proposes a framework that addresses all these issues, thus bringing back NBNNs on the map. We solve the first by extracting CNN activations from local patches at multiple scale levels, similarly to [13]. We address simultaneously the second and third by proposing a scalable version of Naive Bayes Non-linear Learning (NBNL, [7]). Results obtained using pre-trained CNNs on standard scene and domain adaptation databases show the strength of our approach, opening a new season for NBNNs.",

In this paper, we address two fundamental limitations of VLAD:  its requirement for the local descriptors to have vector form and its restriction to linear classifiers due to its high-dimensionality. To this end, we introduce a kernelized version of VLAD. This not only lets us inherently exploit more sophisticated classification schemes, but also enables us to efficiently aggregate non-vector descriptors (e.g., manifold-valued data) in the VLAD framework. Furthermore, we propose an approximate formulation that allows us to accelerate the coding process while still benefiting from the properties of kernel VLAD. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach at handling manifold-valued data, such as covariance descriptors, on several classification tasks.  Our results also evidence the benefits of our nonlinear VLAD descriptors against the linear ones in Euclidean space using several standard benchmark datasets.",

        "abstract": "The complex compositional structure of language makes problems at the intersection of vision and language challenging. But language also provides a strong prior that can result in good superficial performance, without the underlying models truly understanding the visual content.  This can hinder progress in pushing state of art in the computer vision aspects of multi-modal AI.  In this paper, we address binary Visual Question Answering (VQA) on abstract scenes. We formulate this problem as visual verification of concepts inquired in the questions. Specifically, we convert the question to a tuple that concisely summarizes the visual concept to be detected in the image. If the concept can be found in the image, the answer to the question is \"yes\", and otherwise \"no\". Abstract scenes play two roles (1) They allow us to focus on the high-level semantics of the VQA task as opposed to the low-level recognition problems, and perhaps more importantly, (2) They provide us the modality to balance the dataset such that language priors are controlled, and the role of vision is essential. In particular, we collect fine-grained pairs of scenes for every question, such that the answer to the question is \"yes\" for one scene, and \"no\" for the other for the exact same question. Indeed, language priors alone do not perform better than chance on our balanced dataset. Moreover, our proposed approach matches the performance of a state-of-the-art VQA approach on the unbalanced dataset, and outperforms it on the balanced dataset.",

        "abstract": "Video concept learning often requires a large set of training samples. In practice, however, acquiring noise-free training labels with sufficient positive examples is very expensive. A plausible solution for training data collection is by sampling from the vast quantities of images and videos on the Web. Such a solution is motivated by the assumption that the retrieved images or videos are highly correlated with the query. Still, a number of challenges remain. First, Web videos are often untrimmed. Thus, only parts of the videos are relevant to the query. Second, the retrieved Web images are always highly relevant to the issued query. However, thoughtlessly utilizing the images in the video domain may even hurt the performance due to the well known semantic drift and domain gap problems. As a result, a valid question is how Web images and videos interact for video concept learning. In this paper, we propose a Lead--Exceed Neural Network (LENN), which reinforces the training on Web images and videos in a curriculum manner. Specifically, the training proceeds by inputting frames of Web videos to obtain a network. The Web images are then filtered by the learnt network and the selected images are additionally fed into the network to enhance the architecture and further trim the videos. In addition, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) can be applied on the trimmed videos to explore temporal information. Encouraging results are reported on UCF101, TRECVID 2013 and 2014 MEDTest in the context of both action recognition and event detection. Without using human annotated exemplars, our proposed LENN can achieve 74.4% accuracy on UCF101 dataset.",

Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance.  Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is less likely to predict false positives on background. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, when generalizing from natural images to other domains like artwork.",

We formulate ZSR as a binary prediction problem. Our resulting classifier is class-independent. It takes an arbitrary pair of source and target domain instances as input and predicts whether or not they come from the same class, i.e. whether there is a match. We model the posterior probability of a match since it is a sufficient statistic and propose a latent probabilistic model in this context. We develop a joint discriminative learning framework based on dictionary learning to jointly learn the parameters of our model for both domains, which ultimately leads to our class-independent classifier. Many of the existing embedding methods can be viewed as special cases of our probabilistic model. On ZSR our method shows 4.90% improvement over the state-of-the-art in accuracy averaged across four benchmark datasets. We also adapt ZSR method for zero-shot retrieval and show 22.45% improvement accordingly in mean average precision (mAP).",

        "abstract": "Tolerance to image variations (e.g. translation, scale, pose, illumination, background) is an important desired property of any object recognition system, be it human or machine. Moving towards increasingly bigger datasets has been trending in computer vision especially with the emergence of highly popular deep learning models. While being very useful for learning invariance to object inter- and intra-class shape variability, these large-scale wild datasets are not very useful for learning  invariance to other parameters urging researchers to resort to other tricks for training a model. In this work, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset, which is freely and publicly available, and use it to answer several fundamental questions regarding selectivity and invariance properties of convolutional neural networks. Our dataset contains two parts: a) objects shot on a turntable: 15 categories, 8 rotation angles, 11 cameras on a semi-circular arch, 5 lighting conditions, 3 focus levels, variety of backgrounds (23.4 per instance) generating 1320 images per instance (about 22 million images in total), and b) scenes: in which a robotic arm takes pictures of objects on a 1:160 scale scene. We study: 1) invariance and selectivity of different CNN layers, 2) knowledge transfer from one object category to another, 3) systematic or random sampling of images to build a train set, 4) domain adaptation from synthetic to natural scenes, and 5) order of knowledge delivery to CNNs. We also discuss how our analyses can lead the field to develop more efficient deep learning methods.",
