        "abstract": "This paper demonstrates that a 1-DOF planar ball-throwing robot has the capability of controlling three kinematic variables of a ball independently: translational velocity, angular velocity, and direction. The throwing motion is modeled using two underactuated contact dynamics, called a finger-link contact model and a fingertip contact model, with a unidirectional transition from one model to another. A combination of a preliminary global search method and a search algorithm based on a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm provides joint torque commands for this highly nonlinear system. An experimental system with a 1-DOF planer manipulator has been developed that throws a disk (ball) in a frictionless plane. The experimental results confirm the validity of the contact models and the feasibility of independent control of the three kinematic variables.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Unstructured, human environments present great challenges and opportunities for robotic manipulation and grasping. Robots that reliably grasp household objects with unknown or uncertain properties would be especially useful, since these robots could better generalize their capabilities across the wide variety of objects found within domestic environments. Within this paper, we address the problem of picking up an object sitting on a plane in isolation, as can occur when someone drops an object on the floor - a common problem for motor- impaired individuals. We assume that the robot has the ability to coarsely position itself in front of the object, but otherwise grasps the object with an open-loop strategy that does not vary from object to object. We present a novel end effector that is capable of robustly picking up a diverse array of everyday handheld objects given these conditions. This straight-forward, inexpensive, nonpre- hensile end effector combines a compliant finger with a thin planar component with a leading wedge that slides underneath the object. We empirically validated the efficacy of this design through a set of 1096 trials over which we systematically varied the object location, object type, object configuration, and floor characteristics. Our implementation, which we mounted on a iRobot Create, had a success rate of 94.71 % on 680 trials, which used 4 floor types with 34 objects of particular relevance to assistive applications in 5 different poses each (4x34x5=680). The robot also had strong performance with objects that would be difficult to grasp using a traditional end effector, such as a dollar bill, a pill, a cloth, a credit card, a coin, keys, and a watch. Prior to this test, we performed 416 trials in order to assess the performance of the end effector with respect to variations in object position.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a device that significantly increases the safety level of suspended robots whose end-effector orientation remains constant with respect to the vertical direction (e.g. Scara-type suspended robots). The device is a two-degree-of-freedom (DOF) parallel mechanism with a parallepipedic architecture on which two revolute joints have been replaced with commercially available torque limiters. The device is implemented as a mechanical connection between the robot and the effector. It is rigid unless excessive horizontal forces are applied on the end-effector, for example during a collision. The level of force that activates the mechanism is set by properly adjusting the threshold of the torque limiters. Furthermore, a collision can be rapidly detected with a limit switch placed on one of the links of the mechanism and a signal can be sent directly to brakes that will stop the robot, without passing through a controller and thus improving the reliability and reaction-time of the safety system. By mechanically disconnecting the robot from its end-effector, the device ensures that the person involved in the collision is only subjected to the inertia of the end-effector and thus potential injuries are greatly reduced. A prototype of the proposed device has been built to validate the concept and to study its behaviour for collisions with different velocities and orientations.",

        "abstract": "Now that mobile robots are getting tested more and more in challenging areas, difficulties in control, particularly when the robot cannot be seen, have appeared. In this research a mobile snake robot with actuated wheels is given the ability to sense its surroundings through its wheels by 3DOF force sensors, so that semi-autonomous control can be realized. This will simplify necessary operator commands and improve situation awareness through information feedback. Even with the many limitations of practical robot design, such as unwanted flexibilities, and measuring while actuating the wheels, the sensor's errors are confirmed to vary between just 1% and 3%. Moreover, sensitivity is equal over the wheels, only a 3s calibration at startup is needed, and the sensor is shown to be resistant to aging and temperature change. The sensor is implemented directly into a new snake robot, one sensor in each segment. Its central control will adjust the snake body according to the surroundings while automatically avoiding obstacles and crossing gaps.",

        "abstract": "We propose a new method for automatically accessing an internet database of 3D models that are searchable only by their user-annotated labels, for using them for vision and robotic manipulation purposes. Instead of having only a local database containing already seen objects, we want to use shared databases available over the internet. This approach while having the potential to dramatically increase the visual recognition capability of robots, also poses certain problems, like wrong annotation due to the open nature of the database, or overwhelming amounts of data (many 3D models) or the lack of relevant data (no models matching a specified label). To solve those problems we propose the following: First, we present an outlier/inlier classification method for reducing the number of results and discarding invalid 3D models that do not match our query. Second, we utilize an approach from computer graphics, the so called \u2018morphing\u2019, to this application to specialize the models, in order to describe more objects. Third, we search for 3D models using a restricted search space, as obtained from our knowledge of the environment. We show our classification and matching results and finally show how we can recover the correct scaling with the stereo setup of our robot.",

        "abstract": "In human-robot interaction, it is important for the robot to know the head movement, gaze direction and expression of the conversation partner, since such information are deeply related with the attention, intention and emotion. Recently, many types of real-time measurement systems for head pose and gaze direction have been proposed and utilized for human interfaces and ergonomics applications. We have proposed a face measurement system which is non-contact and passive by utilizing a stereo camera pair. However the necessity of the use of stereo camera has several drawbacks. To cope with this problem, this paper proposes a method to measure the 6 DOF motions of the head by utilizing a single camera. The use of 3D face model enables us to predict six 2D motion vector fields of facial features which correspond to six unit motions in translation and rotation. An actual 2D motion vector field obtained by tracking facial features is then resolved into a linear combination of the predicted six motion vector fields. The estimated 6 DOF motions can be obtained as the six coefficients of the linear combination. Through the evaluation of the implemented motion estimation method, it was shown that the accuracy of the proposed estimation method using a single camera was comparable with that of the conventional method using a stereo camera pair. Finally developed face tracking system is demonstrated by a humanoid robot interacting with two persons, which takes advantage of the wide field of view of the camera system due to the unnecessity of the stereoscopy.",

Our framework leverages 3D voxel data, which are reconstructed from multi-camera systems. The use of voxel data leads to viewpoint-free estimation, which benefits in that reconstruction of a training model is needless in different multi-camera arrangements. Other notable aspects of our approach are real-time ensuring speed (up to 30 fps), flexibility towards various complex motions and environments. We treat the pose estimation problem as estimating human pose label from the voxel features and tackle this by example based approach. To ensure the real-time speed and to improve precision of pose estimation, a newly fast and robust near-neighbor search metric is installed prior to the evaluation process, what we call CSI-PSH. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with experiments on both synthetic and real image sequences.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the design, fabrication, and control of a rotational manipulator using shape memory alloy (SMA) wire actuated flexures. Monolithic flexure mechanisms have no friction/backlash and are capable of miniaturization. They are well-suited for tasks that required high precision and packed space. To explore flexure shapes beyond traditional notch hinges and leaf springs, we present a general two-step design method to find the optimal flexure shapes for maximal rotation without yield. The advantages gained from shape variations are shown through a simulation example. We further use a SMA wire to drive the flexure. SMA exhibits large stroke with high power density and requires low driving voltage. By using versatile SMA wire, the rotational range of the manipulator can be significantly increased while the overall size can be kept compact. A feedback PID control algorithm with fuzzy-tuned gains is implemented to precisely control the response of the manipulator. We illustrate its performance by tracking and step response experiments. With the merits shown, we expect this type of manipulator can be utilized in meso to micro scale applications.",

        "abstract": "The car transportation system, which termed as iCART (intelligent cooperative autonomous robot transporters), is developed for handling the car in the narrow space, substituting the parking and unmanning the transportation of cars. iCART is composed of two robots and these robots transport the car in coordination based on a leader-follower type distributed motion control algorithm. To avoid damaging the surface of the car, tires of the car are putted on, not grasped by, the end-effector of robots. Thus, when force/moment applied to the car by robots becomes large, the slip at the contact of the robot with the car occurs. Due to the slip, the relative position between robots is changed. In a conventional algorithm, the relative position is used for the control. Thus, after the contact of the robot with the car slips, occasionally, robots could not coordinate. For overcoming this problem, the motion control algorithm based on the caster-like motion is applied to the car transportation system iCART in this paper. Since this algorithm does not use the relative position information, the system becomes robust against the slip at the contact of the robot with the car. The proposed motion control algorithm is applied to iCART and experimental result illustrates the validity of the proposed algorithm.",

In this paper, a new robot skin capable of sensing multiple contact locations is presented. The motivation behind the proposed design is to produce a relatively inexpensive skin having the capability to provide the spatial location of collisions and also to add compliance to the robot's external cover. The resulting device is a thin flexible sensor sheet made of polyimide films with electrically conductive ink and a pressure sensitive conductive rubber sheet. The problem of internal wire routing is circumvented by the use of conductive ink and a circuit is proposed to minimize the number of output wires. To provide collision absorption and mechanical robustness, the sensor is embedded in different layers of polyurethane using shape deposition manufacturing (SDM). The paper presents the design and the fabrication process of the skin but also some experimental results on the determination of the mechanical properties of the resulting sensor as well as its potential for increasing human safety during human robot interaction.",

Most existing microinjection methods are based on position control without explicit regulation of the injection force. The injection force, if not controlled properly, may destroy the cell and lead to death of the cells. In this paper, we propose a force control based cell injection technology to explicitly regulate the injection force to follow the desired force trajectory during the injection. Any desired force trajectory that is twice continuously differentiable can be realized by the proposed approach. The convergence of the force tracking algorithm is provably guaranteed. Experiments performed on a laboratorial robotic cell injection system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a unique four-axis articulated MEMS robot, constructed by microassembly, targeting micro and nano scale manipulation and probing applications. The first version of this microrobot has a 2P2R (Prismatic Prismatic Revolute Revolute) kinematic configuration, occupies a total volume of 3mm \u00d7 2mm \u00d7 1mm, and operates within a workspace envelope of 50\u00b5m \u00d7 50\u00b5m \u00d7 75\u00b5m. This is by far the largest operating envelope of any independent micropositioner with non-planar dexterity. As a result, it can be classified as a new type of 3 dimensional miniaturized top-down assembly robot with dimensions smaller than 1 cm. The robot incorporates a combination of miniature flexures and cables to drive its joints from high force MEMS actuators. Actuation is accomplished via two banks of in-plane electrothermal actuators, one coupled through an out of plane compliant socket, and the other one coupled remotely via a 30 \u00b5m diameter Cu wire. In this paper, we decouple the motion of the robot joints by identifying the robot Jacobian, and we offer preliminary experimental characterization of the microrobot repeatability. Results show that the robot is repeatable to under 0.5 \u00b5m along XY and 0.015 degrees along pitch and yaw degrees of freedom.",

Taking the turning radius and the angular velocity as unknowns, we obtain the absolute motion trajectories of points on the ldquospinal columnrdquo of robotic fish by superimposing relative body/tail motions on the rigid body circular motion. The hydrodynamic reactive force and the resulting moment are then computed from the motion trajectories, using Lighthill's large-amplitude elongated-body theory, in terms of the two turning parameters. By integrating the dynamics of rigid body motion and averaging out oscillations, implicit equations involving the turning parameters can be established and solved. We also discuss the plan of applying the proposed framework to the modeling of steady turning maneuvers of biomimetic robotic propelled by an ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) caudal fin.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Cable-driven parallel manipulators (CDPMs) are a special class of parallel manipulators that are driven by cables instead of rigid links. Due to the unilateral property of the cables, all the driving cables in a fully-constrained CDPM must always maintain positive tension. As a result, tension analysis is the most essential issue for these CDPMs. By drawing upon the mathematical theory from convex analysis, a sufficient and necessary tension-closure condition is proposed in this paper. The key point of this tension-closure condition is to construct a critical vector that must be positively expressed by the tension vectors associated with the driving cables. It has been verified that such a tension-closure condition is general enough to cater for CDPMs with different numbers of cables and DOFs. Using the tension-closure condition, a computationally efficient algorithm is developed for the tension-closure pose analysis of CDPMs, in which only a limited set of deterministic linear equation systems need to be resolved. This algorithm has been employed for the tension-closure workspace analysis of CDPMs and verified by a number of computational examples. The computational time required by the proposed algorithm is always shorter as compared to other existing algorithms.",

This trend, if carried over to industrial applications, could prove especially detrimental to the future of applied parallel robotics. A comprehensive and straightforward design strategy that guarantees a singularity free workspace is presented in this paper. The design problem is mathematically modeled, and relaxations are suggested for finding solutions. The translational 3-UPU parallel robot is studied to verify the efficacy of the design approach.",

If the anomalies of the magnetic field inside the building are nearly static and they have sufficient local variability, they provide a unique magnetic fingerprint that can be utilized in global self-localization. In this article, a Monte Carlo localization (MCL) technique based on this hypothesis is proposed. The feasibility of the technique is demonstrated by presenting a series of global localization experiments conducted in four arbitrarily selected buildings, including a hospital. The experiment setup consists of a mobile robot instrumented with a 3-axis magnetometer and a computer. In addition, successful human self-localization experiments were conducted by using a wireless wearable magnetometer. The reported experiments suggest that the ambient magnetic field may remain sufficiently stable for longer periods of time, giving support for self-localization techniques utilizing the local deviations of the field.",

The extension is based on the physical analogy with an electric current flowing in a nonhomogeneous conducting medium. Proofs of the ability of the modified approach to avoid zero-probability (definite threat) regions and converge to the goal are provided.

In addition, the requirements for high torque capacity and back-drivability are satisfied with the employment of a custom made cable driven linear electric actuator that combines the high force capacity with excellent back-drivability. The analysis undergoes the optimal design towards the maximization of manipulator workspace, dexterity, torque output and compactness of the device. Finally, the performance of the custom linear actuator and the prototype of the rehabilitation device are shown.",

The saliency map model is a well-known computational model for bottom-up attention selection and serves as a basis of many attention control strategies of cognitive vision systems. A real-time implementation is the prerequisite of an application of bottom-up attention on mobile robots and vehicles. Parallel computation on graphics processing unit (GPU) provides an excellent solution for this kind of compute-intensive image processing. Running on 1 to 4 NVIDIA GeForce 8800 (GTX) graphics cards a frame rate of 313 fps at resolution of 640 times 480 is achieved, which is approximately 8.5 times faster than the standard implementations on CPUs. The implementation is also evaluated using a high-speed camera at 200 Hz. Using two GPUs only 2 ms extra computational time for the saliency map generation in addition to the camera capture time is required for images of 640 times 480 pixels.",

        "abstract": "A novel tactile sensor based on electromagnetic induction that can detect slippage in addition to three-axis force is proposed. The structure of this sensor is simple, and the sensor, which is essentially a displacement gauge, consists of a two-dimensional array of inductors and an elastic body containing a permanent magnet. Formulas to transform the output voltage of the proposed sensor into a force vector are derived, and analyses of both deformation of the proposed structure and magnetic field generated by a cylindrical permanent magnet are carried out to extract transformation parameters. In addition, it is shown that the sensor sensitivity can be designed using the aspect ratio of the cylindrical magnet. A prototype unit-cell of a tactile sensor is developed with four chip inductors, silicon gel as an elastic body and a neodymium magnet, and experiments are undertaken with a six-axis force/torque sensor as a reference. The contributions of inductors to sensor output are observed experimentally to be in agreement with analytical prediction and the reference sensor. Experimental results show that the proposed tactile sensor is useful for three-axis force measurement and slip detection.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the design, analysis, and development of a sixteen-legged palm-sized climbing robot using flat bulk tacky elastomer adhesives as an attachment method is presented. A legged robot with four-bar based kinematics is designed and fabricated with elastomeric footpads. The proposed robot has a passive peeling mechanism for energy efficient and vibration free detachment. A rocker-type mechanism in the leg and compliant foam under the footpads are utilized for passive alignment on concave and convex surfaces. Adhesion experimental data is used to estimate the adhesion and preload saturation on the footpads on different angled acrylic surface. It is showed that although the initial preload does not affect the adhesion and preload saturation point, the orientation and the weight of the robot, roughness of the surface, and waiting time between consecutive steps greatly effect the climbing performance. Experimental results revealed that the robot can climb in any direction in 3D space on smooth surfaces, such as acrylic and glass. It can carry a payload of up to 2 N, which is almost twice as its own weight, on a smooth inverted surface. The robot can robustly climb vertically on relatively rough surfaces such as a painted wall or a wooden door. Potential applications of this robot include inspection, exploration, maintenance, cleaning, repair, and search and rescue.",

Based on a quaternion formulation, the proposed algorithm is designed to have two main steps that are connected in feedback relationship: a quaternion measurement step with a vector selector scheme and a Kalman filter (KF) step. This allows us to choose only the quaternion as the state and measurement vectors in our KF design. Thus, the KF has a minimum-order structure (i.e., 4th-order), which decreases the computational cost. The estimated orientation accuracy is validated experimentally by using an optical tracking system.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study the mechanical behavior of leg muscles and tendons during human walking in order to motivate the design of economical robotic legs. We hypothesize that quasi-passive, series-elastic clutch units spanning the knee joint in a musculoskeletal arrangement can capture the dominant mechanical behaviors of the human knee in level-ground walking. Since the mechanical work done by the knee joint throughout a level-ground self-selected-speed walking cycle is negative, and since there is no element capable of dissipating mechanical energy in the musculoskeletal model, biarticular elements would necessarily need to transfer energy from the knee joint to hip and/or ankle joints. This mechanism would reduce the necessary actuator work and improve the mechanical economy of a human-like walking robot. As a preliminary evaluation of these hypotheses, we vary model parameters, or spring constants and clutch engagement times, using an optimization scheme that minimizes ankle and hip actuator positive work while still maintaining human-like knee mechanics. For model evaluation, kinetic and kinematic gait data were employed from one study participant walking across a level-ground surface at a self-selected gait speed. With this under-actuated leg model, we find good agreement between the model's quasi-passive knee torque and experimental knee values, suggesting that a knee actuator is not necessary for level-ground robotic ambulation at self-selected gait speeds.",

The modified Newton-Euler algorithm generates factorization matrices of the Coriolis and centrifugal terms that satisfy the skew-symmetric property. The computational advantages with respect to numerical evaluation of symbolically obtained dynamic expressions is illustrated on a 7R DLR lightweight manipulator.",

Optic flow is measured by wide angle cameras on board the vehicle and used to generate a virtual environmental force that is reflected to the user through the joystick, as well as feeding back into the control of the vehicle. The coupling between optical flow (velocity) and force is modelled as an impedance - in this case an optical impedance. We show that the proposed control is dissipative and prevents the vehicle colliding with the environment as well as providing the operator with a natural feel for the remote environment. The paper focuses on applications to aerial robotics vehicles, however, the ideas apply directly to other force actuated vehicles such as submersibles or space vehicles, and the authors believe the approach has potential for control of terrestrial vehicles and even teleoperation of manipulators. Experimental results are provided for a simulated aerial robot in a virtual environment controlled by a haptic joystick.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a nonlinear controller for terrain following of a vertical take-off and landing vehicle (VTOL). The VTOL vehicle is assumed to be a rigid body, equipped with a minimum sensor suite (camera and IMU) along with a measure of the forward speed from another sensor such as global positioning system, maneuvering over a textured terrain made of planar surfaces. Assuming that the forward velocity is separately set to a desired value, the proposed control approach ensures terrain following and guaranties the vehicle does not collide with the ground during the task. The proposed control acquires an optical flow from three spatially separate observation points, typically obtained via three cameras or three non collinear directions in a unique camera. The proposed control algorithm has been tested extensively in simulation and then implemented on a quadrotor UAV to demonstrate the performance of the closed loop system.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an image-based approach to perform visual control for differential-drive robots. We use for the first time the elements of the 1D trifocal tensor directly in the control law. The visual control utilizes the usual teach-by showing strategy without requiring any a prior knowledge of the scene and does not need any auxiliary image. The main contribution of the paper is that the proposed two-steps control law ensures total correction of both position and orientation without switching to any other visual constraint rather than the 1D trifocal tensor. The paper exploits the sliding mode control technique in a square system, ensuring stability and robustness for the closed loop. The good performance of the control system is proven via simulations.",

An abstraction where the environment for robots is modeled as an undirected graph with robots placed in its vertices is used (this abstraction is also known as the problem of pebble motion on graphs). A class of the problem with bi-connected graph and at least two unoccupied vertices is defined. A novel polynomial-time solution algorithm for this class of problem is proposed. It is shown in the paper that the new algorithm significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art techniques applicable to the problem. Moreover, the performed experimental evaluation indicates that the new algorithm scales up well which make it suitable for practical problem solving.",

This paper reflects on four existing control algorithms for the task of level ground walking, and then presents theory and test results of a novel control algorithm based on phase plane invariants.

Constraints are usually unobservable and frequently change between contexts. In this paper, we present a novel approach for learning (unconstrained) control policies from movement data, where observations come from movements under different constraints. As a key ingredient, we introduce a small but highly effective modification to the standard risk functional, allowing us to make a meaningful comparison between the estimated policy and constrained observations. We demonstrate our approach on systems of varying complexity, including kinematic data from the ASIMO humanoid robot with 27 degrees of freedom.",

        "abstract": "Identification results dramatically depend on the excitation properties of the motion used to sample the identification model. Strategies to define persistent exciting trajectories have been developed for manipulator robots with few DOF. However they can not easily be extended to humanoid systems and humans due to the important number of DOF; and empirical knowledge is often used to generate and select persistent exciting motions. In this paper we propose a method to choose persistent exciting motions from an existing dataset in order to optimize both the identification results and the computation time. This method is based on the use of the identification model of legged systems obtained from the base-link equations. Instead of using well-established consideration on the condition number of the regressor matrix, the method uses a decomposition of the regressor into elementary sub-regressors and the computation of the condition number for each. A selection rule is then proposed. The overall method is experimentally tested to identify the human body inertial parameters using a data-set of 40 motions. Comparative results obtained from different combinations of motions are given.",

This paper presents a parametric study of flapping wing propulsion, using two types of passive flapping wings and three flapping motions. Each combination of wing type and flapping motion was tested over a range of amplitudes and frequencies ranging from 1.4-36deg and 5-50 Hz respectively. Wing performance was evaluated by measuring lift force and mechanical efficiency for all tests. The performance of Wing A was found to be significantly higher than Wing B, with up to twice the maximum lift and efficiency. Overall, Wing A with the triangular flapping motion was found to be the most suitable for MAVs. This research has the potential to significantly improve the performance of flapping wing propulsion, resulting in new capabilities and applications for MAVs.",

Since the opening angle of the sound cone emitted by a sonar sensor depends on the diameter of the membrane, small-size sonar devices introduce the problem of high uncertainty about which object has been perceived. We present a novel sensor model for ultrasound sensors with large opening angles that allows an autonomous blimp to robustly localize itself in a known environment using Monte Carlo localization. As we demonstrate in experiments with a real blimp, our novel sensor model outperforms a popular sensor model that has in the past been shown to work reliably on wheeled platforms.",

We present a novel integrated communication and planning protocol that enables all vehicles to form a common global map. The fusion of mapping information is facilitated through the Information Filter and performed over a connected acyclic wireless communication network with limited communication range. The formation of the acyclic connected communication network is achieved by partitioning the landmark graph using graph theoretic tools during the planning phase.

The helicopter receives and is controlled by simulated sensory inputs (e.g. visual stimuli) generated in a virtual 3D environment, where the connection between the physical world and the virtual world is provided by a video camera tracking system. The virtual environment is specified by a 3D computer model and is relatively simple to modify compared to realistic scenes. This enables rapid examinations of whether a certain control law is robust under various environments, an important feature of insect behavior. As a first attempt, flight stabilization and yaw rate control near hover are demonstrated, utilizing biologically realistic visual stimuli as in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A successful approach in the recovery of video- rate structure from motion is to allow the camera to keep track of its position in every frame assuming the recovered set of scene landmarks is fixed in 3D, and then to use the poses in a subset of separated frames, or keyframes, to initialise further landmark structure. The landmark structure and keyframe poses are optimised in a bundle adjustment. Unfortunately this monolithic bundle adjustment has cubic complexity. This paper shows how representing landmarks and camera poses in relative frames, and by temporarily removing certain measurements, introduces a conditional indepedence which allows the bundle adjustment to be split into two parts. One \"local\" part involves the most recent keyframes and associated landmarks, and runs in constant time. The other \"global\" part deals with older keyframes and structure, and runs, as ever, in cubic time. Three important outcomes are: (i) the fixed- time local adjustment allows exploratory map-building to keep pace with camera pose tracking; (ii) it produces statistically consistent results; and (iii) referencing to relative frames means that any update in positions from the global adjustment are immediately incorporated in the local fixed-time adjustment. The relative frame approach is applied to the parallel tracking and mapping method for structure from motion, and its results shown to be identical, and the exploratory map building phase shown to maintain fixed time performance.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A Riemannian-geometry approach for control and stabilization of dynamics of object manipulation under holonomic or non-holonomic (but Pfaffian) constraints is presented. First, position/force hybrid control of an endeffector of a multi-joint redundant (or nonredundant) robot under a nonholonomic constraint is reinterpreted in terms of ldquosubmersionrdquo in Riemannian geometry. A force control signal constructed in the image space spanned from the constraint gradient can be regarded as a lifting in the direction orthogonal to the kernel space. By means of the Riemannian distance on the constraint submanifold, stability on a manifold for a redundant system under holonomic constraints is discussed. Second, control and stabilization of dynamics of two-dimensional object grasping and manipulation by using a pair of multi-joint robot fingers are tackled, when a rigid object is given with arbitrary shape. Then, it is shown that rolling contact constraint induce the Euler equation of motion in an implicit function form, in which constraint forces appear as wrench vectors affecting on the object. The Riemannian metric can be introduced in a natural way on a constraint submanifold induced by rolling contacts. A control signal called ldquoblind graspingrdquo is defined and shown to be effective in stabilization of grasping without using the details of information of object shape and parameters or external sensing. The concept of stability of the closed-loop system under constraints is renewed in order to overcome the degrees-of-freedom redundancy problem. An extension of Dirichlet-Lagrange's stability theorem to a system of DOF-redundancy under constraints is presented by using a Morse-Lyapunov function.",

        "abstract": "In biomedical areas, such as protein crystallization, drug discovery and medical diagnostics, thousands of reagents with different viscosities need to be transferred or dispensed in submicroliter range. Most of the commercial automated liquid dispensing systems need to be calibrated through experiment to accurately dispense liquids when the reagents viscosities change, which is time consuming and less accurate. In this paper, an intelligent precise liquid handling system was developed, in which a high speed MEMS flow sensor was used. Benefiting from the feedback of sensor information, the system can self-adjust the open time of the solenoid vale to accurately dispensing desired reagent volume without pre-calibration. Firstly, the system construction was introduced in detail. Secondly, a novel closed-loop control strategy was proposed to calculate valve open-time for each dispensing cycle, which makes the system immune to liquid viscosity, pressure fluctuation and some other disturbances. Finally, experiments results are presented with different dispensing volumes, coefficient of variance (CV) has been shown to be below 3% at 1ldquol and approach 4% at 100 nl.",

        "abstract": "A simple nonlinear proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is proposed to solve the finite-time regulation of uncertain robot manipulators. The semiglobal finite-time stabilization is shown by using Lyapunov theory and finite-time stability theory. The proposed control algorithm does not involve the modeling information in the control law formulation and the control gains can be explicitly determined based on some well-known bounds extracted from the robot dynamics, and thus permits easy implementation. Simulations preformed on a two degrees-of-freedom (DOF) manipulator demonstrate the expected properties of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "A snake robot can traverse cluttered and irregular environments by using irregularities around its body as push-points to aid the propulsion. This is denoted obstacle-aided locomotion and requires the snake robot to have two features: (1) a smooth exterior surface combined with (2) a contact force sensing system. These two features are characteristic of biological snakes, but have received limited attention in snake robot designs so far. This paper presents a joint mechanism for a snake robot aimed at meeting both these requirements. The paper details the design and implementation of the joint mechanism and presents experimental results that validate the function of the contact force measurement system.",

Fibre image guides facilitate instrument miniaturization and have the advantage of being more easily integrated with articulated robotic instruments. In this paper, twin 10,000 pixel coherent fibre bundles (590mum diameter) have been integrated into a bespoke laparoscopic imaging instrument. Images captured by the system have been used to build a 3D map of the environment and reconstruct the laparoscope's 3D pose and motion using a SLAM algorithm. Detailed phantom validation of the system demonstrates its practical value and potential for flexible MIS instrument integration due to the small footprint and flexible nature of the fibre image guides.",

The robot dynamic model is the standard unicycle model and the robot is assumed to measure both the range and relative bearing to the landmarks.

The coordinate transformation considered in this paper has not been previously considered for robocentric mapping applications. Moreover, we provide a rigorous stochastic stability analysis of the filter employed and we examine the conditions under which the mean-square estimation error converges to a steady-state value.",

However, when individual modules assemble, many challenges and opportunities make the control of the assembled system complex. These issues include changes in inertial properties, and redundancy of actuators and sensors. Optimal control methods may be used to coordinate the control of the modules after assembly, insure good performance, and best utilize the combined resources of the assembly of modules. Simulation and experimental results compare this Cooperative algorithm's performance to that of an approach in which the control of the individual modules is not coordinated. Cooperative optimal control methods prove well-suited for controlling redundant, modular space systems.",

Simulations show that the motion that minimizes the constraint force of the snake robot is similar to the sinus-lifting motion in appropriate amplitudes and periods of the body shape.",

        "abstract": "Vision-based control of a robot formation is challenging because the on-board sensor (camera) only provides the view-angle to the other moving robots, but not the distance that must be estimated. In order to guarantee a consistent estimate of the distance by knowing the control inputs and the sensor outputs in a given interval, the nonlinear multi-robot system must preserve its observability. Recent theoretical studies on leader-follower robot formation exploit the interesting influence that the control actions have on observability. Based on these results, in this paper we present a switching active control strategy for formation control. Our control strategy is active in the sense that, while asymptotically achieving the formation control tasks, it also guarantees the system observability in those cases in which all the robots tend to move along non-observable paths. As a result, both estimation and formation performances are improved. Extensive simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed design.",

The new control scheme use the first and the second order derivatives of the error to be regulated to zero. Hessian matrices of an image point are thus determined to be used in the control schemes. Preliminary experimental results obtained on a 6 dof eye-in-hand system shows that a more accurate positioning can be obtained compared with classical methods.",

        "abstract": "A novel approach is presented which aims at building autonomously visual models of unknown objects, using a humanoid robot. Previous methods have been proposed for the specific problem of the next-best-view during the modeling and the recognition process. However our approach differs as it takes advantage of humanoid specificities in terms of embedded vision sensor and redundant motion capabilities. In a previous work, another approach to this specific problem was presented which relies on a derivable formulation of the visual evaluation in order to integrate it with our posture generation method. However to get rid of some limitations we propose a new method, formulated using two steps: (i) an optimization algorithm without derivatives is used to find a camera pose which maximizes the amount of unknown data visible, and (ii) a whole robot posture is generated by using a different optimization method where the computed camera pose is set as a constraint on the robot head.",

        "abstract": "A simple and efficient approach for varying the inherent stiffness and impedance of a muscle-like actuator is presented. The basic architecture of PZT cellular actuators has already achieved a large effective strain (10-20%). This architecture is modified and extended so that each cellular unit can be switched between a zero compliance state and constant compliance state. The effective stiffness of the cellular actuator is varied by changing the distribution of cellular units in the rigid versus compliant state. Furthermore, by placing a multitude of these cellular units in series or parallel, the stiffness can vary within a large set of discrete values. This paper also demonstrates the viability of the variable stiffness cellular actuator for cyclic tasks such as running and flapping. The basic principle and design concept for the actuator is described, followed by force-displacement analysis. A dynamic model is then constructed to demonstrate the variable resonance properties of the actuator under load.",

        "abstract": "Safety of a manipulator designed to be used at home requires different approach than industrial robots, where safety is achieved mainly by decreasing the interaction with humans. Robots for applications at home, however, require frequent interaction with humans. Introducing compliant component gives the answer to the safety issue at the cost of performance degradation. In order to reduce the performance degradation, manipulators equipped with variable stiffness have been studied by many researchers. This paper presents a variable stiffness joint(VSJ) designed for a robot manipulator. The stiffness is generated by leaf springs and two actuators are used to control the position and stiffness of the joint. Changing the effective length of the spring results in change in stiffness. The position of the joint is controlled via rotating two actuators at the same speed in the same direction. The stiffness is controlled when the two actuators rotate in the different speed. Experiments are conducted to show that the position and stiffness are controlled independent with each other and having less stiffness at the joint helps in making unexpected collision with object safer.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the design of a new user-cooperative rope robot. This robot serves as a large-scale haptic interface in a multi-modal Cave environment used for sport simulation. In contrast to current rope robots, the configuration of the presented robot is adaptable to different simulation tasks what makes the robot more versatile. However, this adaptability and the high dynamics in sports lead to challenging requirements and specific design criteria of the hardware components. We present the requirements on the single robot components as well as the design of the entire setup optimized in terms of user-cooperativity and versatility. The setup includes sensors to measure the relevant parameters for user-cooperative control, i.e. position with a high resolution and the rope forces. Furthermore, an algorithm is introduced, which calculates the distance between the single ropes and the user in order to avoid collisions between the ropes and the user. Single points on the user's body are, therefore, tracked with a motion tracking system; the user's single body parts are then represented by geometrical objects whose distances to the ropes are calculated. The algorithm is programmed in such way that the collision detection runs in real-time. Both, the hardware and the algorithm, were evaluated experimentally in two applications, a rowing simulator and a tennis application. The hardware concept combined with the distance calculation allows the use of new kinematic concepts and expands the spectrum of realizable movement tasks that can be implemented into the Cave environment.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Modular robot programming spans a number of issues ranging from high-level coordination to controller distribution and update in individual modules. The latter issue has received little attention from the research community though in our experience it is one of the main factors hindering agile development and experimentation with physical robots: reprogramming tens or hundreds of modules can be a major overhead in the development process and cannot be done with traditional approaches without restarting the robot, which impedes updating a running system. We propose a solution based on a virtual machine design shaped around three core concepts: the context of a module and its role in the ensemble, the reactive nature of robot controllers, and control programs decomposable into subparts that can be dynamically and separately redefined. We show that by incorporating those concepts into the design we are able to both achieve program conciseness (thus providing fast and efficient code distribution) and program expressiveness (thus providing versatility to represent diverse control algorithms). The virtual machine is programmed in a high-level role-oriented language that allows the programmer to declaratively specify how programs are deployed in the modular robot. Our approach enables fast and incremental on-line updates, allowing the programmer to interactively experiment with the physical robots. We show how this design lends itself to an efficient implementation targeting typical resource-constrained modular robotic hardware by illustrating our prototype implementation for the ATRON self-reconfigurable robot.",

        "abstract": "Motion blur is a severe problem in images grabbed by legged robots and, in particular, by small humanoid robots. Standard feature extraction and tracking approaches typically fail when applied to sequences of images strongly affected by motion blur. In this paper, we propose a new feature detection and tracking scheme that is robust even to non-uniform motion blur. Furthermore, we developed a framework for visual odometry based on features extracted out of and matched in monocular image sequences. To reliably extract and track the features, we estimate the point spread function (PSF) of the motion blur individually for image patches obtained via a clustering technique and only consider highly distinctive features during matching. We present experiments performed on standard datasets corrupted with motion blur and on images taken by a camera mounted on walking small humanoid robots to show the effectiveness of our approach. The experiments demonstrate that our technique is able to reliably extract and match features and that it is furthermore able to generate a correct visual odometry, even in presence of strong motion blur effects and without the aid of any inertial measurement sensor.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate and optimize the mechanical design of underactuated hands, a benchmark test is defined that quantifies the ability to hold grasped objects subject to force disturbances as occurs during for instance pick and place operations. The ability to hold is quantified by the magnitude of the maximum permitted static force on the center of a cylindrical object of known radius at which it can still be hold within the underactuated hand. A static grasp model is developed to efficiently calculate the effect of design parameters of the hand on this maximum force. This model is applied to a planar, underactuated hand with six degrees of freedom, calculating the maximum force while the rotational joint stiffnesses and distance between the fingers was varied. We demonstrated that the rotational joint stiffness has no effect on this force, while decreasing the distance between the fingers has a negative effect. These results were validated by measurements in an experimental setup. These preliminary results show that the developed benchmark test can be effective to evaluate and optimize the performance of underactuated hands to hold objects in pick and place operations.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a new two-degree-of-freedom parallel manipulator producing two translations in the vertical plane. One drawback of existing robots built to realize those dof is their lack of rigidity along the transversal axis, another one being their limited ability to provide very high acceleration. Indeed, these architectures cannot be lightweight and stiff at the same time. The proposed architecture is a spatial mechanism which guarantees a good stiffness along the transversal axis. This parallel architecture is composed by two actuated kinematic chains, and two passive chains built in the transversal plane. The key feature of this robot comes from the passive chains which are coupled for creating a kinematic constraint: the platform stays in one plane. A stiffness analysis shows that the robot can be lighter and stiffer than a classical 2 dof mechanism. A prototype of this robot is presented and preliminary tests show that accelerations above 40 g can be achieved while keeping a low tracking error.",

        "abstract": "Accurate localization of landmarks in the vicinity of a robot is a first step towards solving the SLAM problem. In this work, we propose algorithms to accurately estimate the 3D location of the landmarks from the robot only from a single image taken from its on board camera. Our approach differs from previous efforts in this domain in that it first reconstructs accurately the 3D environment from a single image, then it defines a coordinate system over the environment, and later it performs the desired localization with respect to this coordinate system using the environment's features. The ground plane from the given image is accurately estimated and this precedes segmentation of the image into ground and vertical regions. A Markov Random Field (MRF) based 3D reconstruction is performed to build an approximate depth map of the given image. This map is robust against texture variations due to shadows, terrain differences, etc. A texture segmentation algorithm is also applied to determine the ground plane accurately. Once the ground plane is estimated, we use the respective camera's intrinsic and extrinsic calibration information to calculate accurate 3D information about the features in the scene.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We focus on comanipulation, i.e. manipulation of an object simultaneously held by a robot and a human operator. In this domain, a major difficulty is raised by significant variations of human dynamics, which depend not only on the arm posture, but also on the muscular activity (muscular co-contraction) and more generally on the type of task being performed: fine positioning, gross and rapid movements, repeated movements, etc. An ideal comanipulation system should be able of adapting its behavior to the operator's functional intention, resulting in an intuitive assisting device. Toward this goal, we present in this paper first results of our research aimed at developing an instrumented handle mounted on a robot end-effector and held by an operator, that can be used for estimating the grasping force and for adapting the robot controller accordingly. We show first experimental evidences that changes in the grasping force drastically affect the robot controller performances. We thus propose a handle design and a gain scheduling strategy that result in a robot behavior adequate for any kind of grasps. This solution is successfully experimented with a 1 degree of freedom robot under largely variable comanipulation conditions, exhibiting a stable and efficiently adaptive behavior.",

In such situation, the robot enters the environment carrying some landmarks and distributes them according to the rules given in this paper. The utility of the landmark distribution is analyzed. Then, based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF), the active exploration is converted into a problem of multi-objective optimization, in which the objective function includes three aspects, i.e. the accuracy of localization and mapping, the predictive area of the unknown environment that will be explored in next step and the information gain provided by the distributed landmarks respectively. The robot chooses the control input that optimizes the objective function such that accurate localization, high-quality mapping and complete exploration will be realized. And then, the supplementation and the redundancy elimination for landmarks are implemented. At last, a set of simulations is presented to show the effectiveness of our approach.",

        "abstract": "In microsurgery, a surgeon often deals with anatomical structures of sizes that are close to the limit of the human hand accuracy. Robotic assistants can help to push beyond the current state of practice by integrating imaging and robot-assisted tools. This paper demonstrates control of a handheld tremor reduction micromanipulator with visual servo techniques, aiding the operator by providing three behaviors: snap-to, motion-scaling, and standoff-regulation. A stereo camera setup viewing the workspace under high magnification tracks the tip of the micromanipulator and the desired target object being manipulated. Individual behaviors activate in task-specific situations when the micromanipulator tip is in the vicinity of the target. We show that the snap-to behavior can reach and maintain a position at a target with an accuracy of 17.5 \u00b1 0.4\u00b5m Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) distance between the tip and target. Scaling the operator's motions and preventing unwanted contact with non-target objects also provides a larger margin of safety.",

        "abstract": "We have developed a novel way for robots to estimate their pose dynamically in an environment in which RFID tags have been arranged. We previously developed a method for localizing robots using a particle filter. Testing in a room equipped with a lattice of RFID tags at 300-mm intervals revealed that the estimation fails when the robot's RFID readers are near the center of the robot's rotation because the reader could not detect enough tags by rotating movements when the robot's positions are not suitable. We have overcome this problem by developing an active localization algorithm that generates an entropy map from the RFID arrangement information, predicts the pose using a particle filter, and attracts the robot to the target using a dynamic model, the fundamental unit of which is rotation-based angular velocity. Testing demonstrated that a robot using this algorithm and an entropy map can estimate its pose robustly without falling into a dead zone by moving only about 20 cm at most.",

In this paper, we present necessary processes, memories and representations which allow to identify and store locations of objects, encountered from different angles of view, in a visual search task. In particular, we introduce the so-called Feature Ego-Sphere (FES) as the scene memory for a humanoid robot. Experiments comprising different visual search tasks have been carried out on an active humanoid head equipped with perspective and foveal stereo camera systems. The scene is analyzed actively using both camera systems in order to find instances of searched objects in a consistent and persistent manner.",

        "abstract": "It is desirable to know a resident's on-going activities before a robot or a smart system can provide attentive services to meet real human needs. This work addresses the problem of learning and recognizing human daily activities in a dynamic environment. Most currently available approaches learn offline activity models and recognize activities of interest on a real time basis. However, the activity models become outdated when human behaviors or device deployment have changed. It is a tedious and error-prone job to recollect data for retraining the activity models. In such a case, it is important to adapt the learnt activity models to the changes without much human supervision. In this work, we present a self-reconfigurable approach for activity recognition which reconfigures previously learnt activity models and infers multiple activities under a dynamic environment meanwhile pursuing minimal human efforts in relabeling training data by utilizing active-learning assistance.",

        "abstract": "A passive mobile robot carrying a heavy manufacturing tool is activated from across a thin wall. The mobile robot placed within a confined space has no tether and no local battery, but is powered from an outside robot through magnetic coupling. A pair of magnetic feet allows the passive inside robot to hang from a ceiling and walk across a wall. A heavy manufacturing tool held in the middle of the passive inside robot is activated with a Lorentz force actuator-this is also activated from the outside robot. A set of Hall effect sensors on the outside robot detect the magnetic field created by the passive robot in order to estimate the position of the inside robot. First, the task conditions and functional requirements are described, and the design concept of the passive mobile robot is presented. An electro-magnetic model for predicting magnetic field strength and load bearing capacity is used to facilitate design as well as to estimate and control the position of the passive inside robot. A proof-of-concept prototype system is designed and built for application to aircraft manufacturing.",

Possible applications of such a network are distributed sensor networks as well as communication support for disaster or military operations. The algorithm has minimalist requirements on the individual robotic node and does not require any localization. This makes the proposed solution suitable for deployment of large numbers of comparably cheap mobile communication nodes and as a backup solution for more capable systems in GPS-denied environments. Robots keep exploring the configuration space by random walk and stop only if their current location satisfies user-specified constraints on connectivity (number of neighbors). Resulting deployments are robust and convergence is analyzed using both kinematic simulation with a simplified collision and communication model as well as a probabilistic macroscopic model. The approach is validated on a team of 9 iRobot Create robots carrying wireless access points in an indoor environment.",

In contrast to other approaches, our method learns the system dynamics and the value function separately, which permits to identify the individual characteristics and is, therefore, easily adaptable to changing conditions. The major problem in the context of learning control policies lies in high-dimensional state and action spaces, that needs to be explored in order to identify the optimal policy. In this paper, we propose an approach that learns the system dynamics and the value function in an alternating fashion based on Gaussian process models. Additionally, to reduce computation time and to make the system applicable to online learning, we present an efficient sparsification method. In experiments carried out with a real miniature blimp we demonstrate that our approach can learn height control online. Further results obtained with an inverted pendulum show that our method requires less data to achieve the same performance as an off-line learning approach.",

To ensure a safe traversal a robot has to infer the current ground surface from sensor readings. Recent techniques generate a model which predicts the terrain class from single vibration signals disregarding the temporal coherence between consecutive measurements. In this paper, we present a novel approach in which the final classification relies on the analysis of not only one, but several recent observations. Therefore, the probabilistic framework of the Bayes filter is adopted to the problem of terrain classification. We propose an adaptive approach which automatically adjusts its parameters according to the history of observations. To demonstrate the performance of our method we further describe and compare another technique based on temporal coherence. The evaluation using data collected from our RWI ATRV-Jr robot shows that our approach is both reactive and stable enough to detect fast terrain transitions and selective misclassifications.",

        "abstract": "Herds of livestock, when left to their own devices, will forage for food in predictable patterns, and will often overgraze preferred areas while leaving other areas untouched. The field of grazing management looks to improve the efficiency of land use by moving the animals through different pastures at regular intervals, akin to coverage algorithms used in robotics but with non-uniform coverage and additional constraints due to the animals' natural behaviors. The knowledge of the field of grazing management is largely in the hands of ranchers and other domain experts, and as such has not been the subject of much computational study. In this work, we have created novel learning techniques for expert systems that use both off-line and online learning to generate efficient performance. The rules of the expert systems are initially developed using an evolutionary algorithm, and after deployment, an adaptive algorithm tracks the state of the system and updates rule weights to improve both coverage efficiency and animal stress levels. We present a series of results based on increasingly complex versions of simulated herd models that show improvements over unconstrained motion in each case, and suggest how the algorithm can apply to robotic coverage problems.",

For the purpose, we propose the adaptive triangular mesh generation algorithm that enables robots to generate triangular meshes of various sizes adapting to changing environmental conditions. A locally interacting, geometric technique allows robots to generate each triangular mesh with their two neighbor robots. Specifically, we have assumed that robots are not allowed to have the identifier, any pre-determined leaders or common coordinate systems, and any explicit communication. Under such minimal conditions, the positions of the robots were shown to converge to the desired distribution, which was mathematically proven and also verified through extensive simulations. Our preliminary results indicate that the proposed algorithm can be applied to the problem regarding the coverage of an area of interest by a swarm of mobile sensors.",

Details on the fabrication as well as basic design and analyses methods are given. These techniques are then employed to fabricate an example structure that is subsequently integrated with a microfluidic channel. The eventual purpose of this example structure would be to serve as an interface between a microfluidic device and its environment, using a brush-like structure to sweep cells into the channel, which could then be delivered to another microfluidic system for analyses of the cells. The resulting brush-like structure fits within a 6 mm times 4 mm times 2 mm volume and can be further miniaturized. The alteration of compressed air and vacuum modulated by pneumatic solenoid valves is used to push and pull a plunger/rod system that actuates the device. The delivery of the pressurized air and vacuum is accomplished through flexible 500 mum-diameter tubing to the plunger/rod system but future work would involve completely containing the actuation on a chip-size device.",

        "abstract": "Quadrotor helicopters have become increasingly important in recent years as platforms for both research and commercial unmanned aerial vehicle applications. This paper extends previous work on several important aerodynamic effects impacting quadrotor flight in regimes beyond nominal hover conditions. The implications of these effects on quadrotor performance are investigated and control techniques are presented that compensate for them accordingly. The analysis and control systems are validated on the Stanford Testbed of Autonomous Rotorcraft for Multi-Agent Control quadrotor helicopter testbed by performing the quadrotor equivalent of the stall turn aerobatic maneuver. Flight results demonstrate the accuracy of the aerodynamic models and improved control performance with the proposed control schemes.",

        "abstract": "A pair of dynamically scaled robotic dragonfly model wings was developed to investigate the aerodynamic effect of wing-wing interaction in dragonfly flight. Instantaneous aerodynamic forces were measured while forewing-hindwing phase difference (gamma) was systematically varied. Experimental results showed that, (i) for hovering flight, gamma=0deg enhanced the lift force on both forewing and hindwing; gamma=180deg reduced the total lift force, but was beneficial for vibration suppression and body posture stabilization. In nature, 0deg is employed by dragonflies in acceleration mode while 180deg is usually in hovering mode. (ii) For forward flight, wing-wing interaction enhances forewing lift while reduced hindwing lift at all phase differences. Furthermore, the total lift was slightly reduced for gamma= 0deg to 90deg and significantly reduced by 18% when gamma=270deg. The results consist well with the fact that, dragonflies usually employ 50deg to 100deg for forward flight, but seldom employ 270deg. PIV results are shown for wing-wing interaction analysis.",

We base our model on an affordance network, i.e., a mapping between robot actions, robot perceptions and the perceived effects of these actions upon objects. We extend the affordance model to incorporate words. Using verbal descriptions of a task, the model uses temporal co-occurrence to create links between speech utterances and the involved objects, actions and effects. We show that the robot is able form useful word-to-meaning associations, even without considering grammatical structure in the learning process and in the presence of recognition errors. These word-to-meaning associations are embedded in the robot's own understanding of its actions. Thus they can be directly used to instruct the robot to perform tasks and also allow to incorporate context in the speech recognition task.",

Our method seeks to integrate all of the sensor information using a statistically optimal non-linear least squares smoothing algorithm to estimate vehicle poses simultaneously to a dense point feature map of the terrain. A visualisation of the terrain structure is then created by building a textured mesh-surface from the estimated point features. The resulting terrain reconstruction can be used for a range of environmental monitoring missions such as invasive plant detection and biomass mapping.",

Specific solutions have then to be investigated. In this paper, the prevention of light all-terrain vehicle (ATV) rollover is addressed. First, a backstepping observer is designed in order to estimate online a rollover indicator accounting for sliding phenomena, from a low-cost perception system. Next, the maximum vehicle velocity, compatible with a safe motion over some horizon of prediction, is computed via predictive functional control (PFC), and can then be applied, if needed, to the vehicle actuator to prevent from rollover. The capabilities of the proposed device are demonstrated and discussed thanks to an advanced simulation testbed that has proved to supply results very close to experimental ones.",

        "abstract": "Although RANSAC is the most widely used robust estimator in computer vision, it has certain limitations making it ineffective in some situations, such as the motion estimation problem, in which uncertainty on the image features changes according to the capturing conditions. The greatest problem is that the threshold used by RANSAC to detect inliers cannot be changed adaptively; instead it is fixed by the user. An adaptive scale algorithm must therefore be applied in such cases. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive scale robust estimator that adaptively finds the best solution with the best scale to fit the inliers, without the need for predefined information. Our new adaptive scale estimator matches the residual probability density from an estimate and the standard Gaussian probability density function to find the best inlier scale. Our algorithm is evaluated in several motion estimation experiments under varying conditions and the results are compared with several of the latest adaptive-scale robust estimators.",

        "abstract": "The Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) model has long been established as an effective and accurate descriptive model for running animals of widely differing sizes and morphologies, while also serving as a basis for several hopping robot designs. Further research on this model led to the discovery of several analytic approximations to its normally nonintegrable dynamics. However, these approximations mostly focus on steady-state running with symmetric trajectories due to their linearization of gravitational effects, an assumption that is quickly violated for locomotion on more complex terrain wherein transient, non-symmetric trajectories dominate. In this paper, we introduce a novel gravity correction scheme that extends on one of the more recent analytic approximations to the SLIP dynamics and achieves good accuracy even for highly non-symmetric trajectories. Our approach is based on incorporating the total effect of gravity on the angular momentum throughout a single stance phase and allows us to preserve the analytic simplicity of the approximation to support our longer term research on reactive footstep planning for dynamic legged locomotion. We compare the performance of our method in simulation to two other existing analytic approximations and show that it outperforms them for most physically realistic non-symmetric SLIP trajectories while maintaining the same accuracy for symmetric trajectories.",

RANSAM exploits the theory of the birthday attack whose mathematical background is known from cryptography. The RANSAM technique can be applied to various fields of application such as mobile robotics, computer vision, and medical robotics. Since standard computers feature multi-core processors nowadays, a considerable speedup can be obtained by distributing selected subtasks of RANSAM among the available cores. First of all this paper addresses the parallelization of the RANSAM approach. Several important characteristics are derived from a probabilistic point of view. Moreover, we apply a fuzzy criterion to compute the matching quality, which is an important step towards real-time capability. The algorithm has been implemented for Windows and for the QNX RTOS. In an experimental section the performance of both implementations is compared and our theoretical results are validated.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, an insect-inspired motion detector (Reichardt-model) is applied to visual servo control to ensure the stability of the system with high gain and time delay in its feedback. A Reichardt-based control scheme is compared with a conventional visual servoing approach. As a consequence of the specific velocity dependence of the Reichardt-model, the stability margin of the visual servo control is increased and high overall gains, thus, better performance are achievable. The response of the Reichardt-model in the experiment and the control performance of velocity control approach with the Reichardt-model in the closed loop are investigated. The velocity control model is tested on a 1-DOF linear motor module with different feedback gain and different time delay in the loop. The results of simulation and realtime experiments demonstrate the stabilizing character of the Reichardt-based approach.",

        "abstract": "Low-cost robots with a large number of degrees of freedom are becoming increasingly popular, nevertheless their programming is still a domain for experts. This paper introduces the Kouretes Motion Editor (KME), a freely-available interactive software tool for designing complex motion patterns on robots with many degrees of freedom using intuitive means. KME allows for a TCP/IP connection to a real or simulated robot, over which various robot poses can be communicated to or from the robot and manipulated locally using the KME graphical user interface. This portability and flexibility enables the user to work under different modes, with different robots, using different host machines. KME is originally designed for the Aldebaran Nao humanoid robot which features a total of 21 degrees of freedom, but can be easily customized for other robots. KME has been employed successfully by Kouretes, the RoboCup team of the Technical University of Crete, for designing various special actions at the RoboCup 2008 competition (Standard Platform League).",

Optimal tuning of such parameters involves handling of nonlinearities in system dynamics and cost functions, which makes the problem challenging. We propose a step-by-step numerical algorithm that select suboptimal parameters while ensuring system stability. The controller is, suboptimal due to the facts that (1) it is in the form of a Slotine-type sliding mode control, (2) the numerical recursive algorithm might fall into a local minimum, and (3) the controller coefficients depend on the initial conditions of the system. The method is successfully applied to a two-link robot manipulator and the results are compared in simulation with those of a conventional controller.",

        "abstract": "Since planning environments are complex and no single planner exists that is best for all problems, much work has been done to explore methods for selecting where and when to apply particular planners. However, these two questions have been difficult to answer, even when adaptive methods meant to facilitate a solution are applied. For example, adaptive solutions such as setting learning rates, hand-classifying spaces, and defining parameters for a library of planners have all been proposed. We demonstrate a strategy based on unsupervised learning methods that makes adaptive planning more practical. The unsupervised strategies require less user intervention, model the topology of the problem in a reasonable and efficient manner, can adapt the sampler depending on characteristics of the problem, and can easily accept new samplers as they become available. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that in a wide variety of environments, the regions automatically identified by our technique represent the planning space well both in number and placement. We also show that our technique has little overhead and that it out-performs two existing adaptive methods in all complex cases studied.",

Based on the results of this simulation, we designed experiments to observe the sliding and object grasping of a soft fingertip, in which a 3-DOF (degree of freedom) micro force/moment sensor was embedded. With this sensor, forces and moments acting in the fingertip are measured based on the piezoresistive effect. These measurements provide information on the status of contact and sliding of a soft fingertip on a surface. Based on these results, incipient slip, which has an important role in object gripping by a robot manipulator, can be realized. Textile's texture recognition experiments were also conducted to assess potentials of the fingertip in tactile and texture perception.",

        "abstract": "Human hands are capable of many dexterous grasping and manipulation tasks. To understand human levels of dexterity and to achieve it with robotic hands, we constructed an anatomically correct testbed (ACT) hand which allows for the investigation of the biomechanical features and neural control strategies of the human hand. This paper focuses on developing control strategies for the index finger motion of the ACT Hand. A direct muscle position control and a force-optimized joint control are implemented as building blocks and tools for comparisons with future biological control approaches. We show how Gaussian process regression techniques can be used to determine the relationships between the muscle and joint motions in both controllers. Our experiments demonstrate that the direct muscle position controller allows for accurate and fast position tracking, while the force-optimized joint controller allows for exploitation of actuation redundancy in the finger critical for this redundant system. Furthermore, a comparison between Gaussian processes and least squares regression method shows that Gaussian processes provide better parameter estimation and tracking performance. This first control investigation on the ACT hand opens doors to implement biological strategies observed in humans and achieve the ultimate human-level dexterity.",

Rather than holistic search for the whole memory contents the model adopt associated feature analysis to successively memorize a newly experience state-action pair as an action of past experience, produce motor commands that make the controlled system to behave desirably in the future. Actor-Critic learning is used to adaptively tuning the control parameters, while an on-line variant of random forests (RF) learner is used to approximate the policy of Actor and the value function of Critic. Learning capability of the proposed model is experimentally examined through a task of Cart-Pole balancing problem, designed in mind as computation with perception. The result shows that the robot with self-optimizing memory acquired behaviors such as balancing the pole, displays planning based on past experiences.",

The method operates on targets consisting of kinematic chains with known geometry. The tracked target is divided into one or more areas of consistent appearance. The appearance of each area is represented by a classifier trained to assign a class-conditional probability to image feature vectors. A search is then performed on the configuration space of the target to find the maximum likelihood configuration. In the search, candidate hypotheses are evaluated by rendering a 3D model of the target object and measuring its consistency with the class probability map. The method is demonstrated for tool tracking on videos from two surgical domains, as well as in a human hand-tracking task.",

Given an environment with obstacles, and many people moving through it, we construct a separate narrow field of view video for as many people as possible, by stitching together video segments from multiple cameras over time. We employ a novel approach to assign cameras to people as a function of time, with camera switches when needed. The problem is modeled as a bipartite graph and the solution corresponds to a maximum matching. As people move, the solution is efficiently updated by computing an augmenting path rather than by solving for a new matching. This reduces computation time by an order of magnitude. In addition, solving for the shortest augmenting path minimizes the number of camera switches at each update. When not all people can be covered by the available cameras, we cluster as many people as possible into small groups, then assign cameras to groups using a minimum cost matching algorithm. We test our method using numerous runs from different simulators.",

The key part is the extension of a previous Lemma that is used to prove that P+d or PD+d controllers can stabilize the teleoperator under variable timedelays, and moreover, they provide position tracking. The paper outlines the conditions under which velocities and position errors, of the nonlinear teleoperator, are bounded, and using Barbalat's Lemma, it is proved asymptotic converge to zero if the local manipulator stands still and the remote manipulator does not interact with the environment. Simulations and real experiments validate the proposed schemes. The experiments have been performed using the Internet as communication channel between Urbana-Champaign, USA and Barcelona, Spain.",

        "abstract": "Atomic force microscope (AFM) based nanomanipulation systems are generally slow, not repeatable and imprecise due to a lack of control on the success of limited attempts in the literature. To improve the amount of control, reliability and precision of such systems, this work proposes an automated nanomanipulation method. Spherical gold nanoparticles with 100 nm diameter are positioned mechanically on a flat mica substrate by contact manipulation by the AFM probe tip to a desired position autonomously. The most significant issue of the manipulation operation is the lack of real-time visual feedback. This issue is solved by developing a robust algorithm for particle center detection and using the AFM cantilever deflection (force) signals to detect contact losses in real-time and to repeat the manipulation again until the target location is reached. Using these solutions, an automated AFM manipulation system is developed and a statistical study is made, where gold nanoparticles are positioned for 50 times to random target positions in different directions and pushing distances. 86% of all the particles could be successfully positioned to the target positions with an accuracy less than 100 nm. Unsuccessful positioning operations are due to the particle sticking to either the tip (8%) or the substrate (6%). Additionally, performance of the successful manipulations are investigated on 60 manipulation operations in 12 different directions and 5 different distances. The metrics used to quantify performance are the final particle position error and the average manipulation speed.",

While no robotic systems have provided performance close to manual operation, according to the preliminary experimental results (n = 90) from this study, this microrobotic system demonstrated: (i) an injection speed of 9 embryos/min vs. 2 embryos/min in typical manual operation, (ii) a success rate of 98.9%, a higher rate than the best success rate (90%) achieved by proficient injection technicians with over 10 years' experience, and (iii) a high survival rate of 82.1%, a rate comparable with the best survival rate (~80%) achieved by proficient injection technicians. Further improvement of the automated system will change the way of how mouse embryos are injected and promise its practical use in biology laboratories and mouse facilities.",

        "abstract": "In this article a new method is presented to obtain a full and precise calibration of camera-robot systems with eye-in-hand cameras. It achieves a simultaneous and numerically stable calibration of intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters by analysing the image coordinates of a single point marker placed in the environment of the robot. The method works by first determining a rough initial estimate of the camera pose in the tool coordinate frame. This estimate is then used to generate a set of uniformly distributed calibration poses from which the object is visible. The measurements obtained in these poses are then used to obtain the exact parameters with CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy), a derandomised variant of an evolution strategy optimiser. Minimal claims on the surrounding area and flexible handling of environmental and kinematical limitations make this method applicable to a range of robot setups and camera models. The algorithm runs autonomously without supervision and does not need manual adjustments. Our problem formulation is directly in the 3D space which helps in minimising the resulting calibration errors in the robot's task space. Both simulations and experimental results with a real robot show a very good convergence and high repeatability of calibration results without requiring user-supplied initial estimates of the calibration parameters.",

        "abstract": "Traditional approaches to programming robots are generally inaccessible to non-robotics-experts. A promising exception is the learning from demonstration paradigm. Here a policy mapping world observations to action selection is learned, by generalizing from task demonstrations by a teacher. Most learning from demonstration work to date considers data from a single teacher. In this paper, we consider the incorporation of demonstrations from multiple teachers. In particular, we contribute an algorithm that handles multiple data sources, and additionally reasons about reliability differences between them. For example, multiple teachers could be inequally proficient at performing the demonstrated task. We introduce Demonstration Weight Learning (DWL) as a learning from demonstration algorithm that explicitly represents multiple data sources and learns to select between them, based on their observed reliability and according to an adaptive expert learning inspired approach. We present a first implementation of DWL within a simulated robot domain. Data sources are shown to differ in reliability, and weighting is found impact task execution success. Furthermore, DWL is shown to produce appropriate data source weights that improve policy performance.",

        "abstract": "In Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM), it is well known that probabilistic filtering approaches which aim to estimate the robot and map state sequentially suffer from poor computational scaling to large map sizes. Various authors have demonstrated that this problem can be mitigated by approximations which treat estimates of features in different parts of a map as conditionally independent, allowing them to be processed separately. When it comes to the choice of how to divide a large map into such \u2018submaps\u2019, straightforward heuristics may be sufficient in maps built using sensors such as laser range-finders with limited range, where a regular grid of submap boundaries performs well. With visual sensing, however, the ideal division of submaps is less clear, since a camera has potentially unlimited range and will often observe spatially distant parts of a scene simultaneously. In this paper we present an efficient and generic method for automatically determining a suitable submap division for SLAM maps, and apply this to visual maps built with a single agile camera. We use the mutual information between predicted measurements of features as an absolute measure of correlation, and cluster highly correlated features into groups. Via tree factorisation, we are able to determine not just a single level submap division but a powerful fully hierarchical correlation and clustering structure. Our analysis and experiments reveal particularly interesting structure in visual maps and give pointers to more efficient approximate visual SLAM algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the problem of autonomous navigation of automobiles has gained substantial interest in the robotics community. Especially during the two recent DARPA grand challenges, autonomous cars have been shown to robustly navigate over extended periods of time through complex desert courses or through dynamic urban traffic environments. In these tasks, the robots typically relied on GPS traces to follow pre-defined trajectories so that only local planners were required. In this paper, we present an approach for autonomous navigation of cars in indoor structures such as parking garages. Our approach utilizes multi-level surface maps of the corresponding environments to calculate the path of the vehicle and to localize it based on laser data in the absence of sufficiently accurate GPS information. It furthermore utilizes a local path planner for controlling the vehicle. In a practical experiment carried out with an autonomous car in a real parking garage we demonstrate that our approach allows the car to autonomously park itself in a large-scale multi-level structure.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous robotic mapping has been an open research topic for more than twenty years. The primary objective of the robotic mapping problem is to design methods that can guide a robot around an environment and allow it to create a map of what has been sensed. Most automatic mapping algorithms rely on robot pose estimation to fuse map data together. This paper demonstrates that through feature extraction using spin-histograms, the pose of the robot can be estimated accurately enough for an iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm to register overlapping data sets. By eliminating consideration for points according to curvature and saliency, the spin-histogram matching process can improve in both accuracy and computation time. In combination with a global registration algorithm known as simultaneous matching, this process can obtain a fully autonomous registration process.",

The goal of this work is to autonomously navigate to remote locations, well beyond the sensing horizon of the rover, with minimal interaction with a human operator. We employ LIDAR range sensors due to their accuracy, long range and robustness in the harsh lighting conditions of space. Irregular triangular meshes (ITMs) are used for representing the environment providing an accurate yet compact spatial representation. In this paper a novel path-planning technique through the ITM is introduced, which guides the rover through flatter terrain and safely away from obstacles. Experiments performed in CSA's Mars emulation terrain that validate our approach are also presented.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a model based system for a mobile robot to find an optimal pose for the observation of a person in indoor living environments. We define the observation pose as a combination of the camera position and view direction as well as further parameters like the aperture angle. The optimal placement of a camera is not trivial because of the high dynamic range of the scenes near windows or other bright light sources, which often results in poor image quality due to glare or hard shadows. The proposed method tries to minimize these negative effects by determining an optimal camera pose based on two major models: A spatial free space model and a representation of the lighting. In particular, a task-dependent optimization takes into account the intended purpose of the camera images, e.g. different inputs are needed for video communication with other people or for an image-processing based passive observation of the person's activities. To prove the validity of our approach, we present first experimental results comparing the chosen observation pose and resulting image with and without respect to lighting in different observation tasks.",

The SLAM process provides the object tracker with information to register objects to the map's frame, and the object tracker allows the marking of features, either those on objects, or those created by their occluding edges, or those occluded by objects. Experiments are presented to verify the recovered geometry and to indicate the impact on camera pose in monoSLAM of including and avoiding moving features.",

        "abstract": "While a network of autonomous mobile agents is capable of performing spatially distributed tasks, communication between agents imposes a class of constraints over the corresponding task. This paper proposes a distributed paradigm to deal with a critical communication constraint, connectedness constraint, where a group of mobile agents are required to remain connected while performing a task (e.g., formation control, consensus, etc.). The proposed method adaptively extracts communication backbone of the group, which is formed by a subset of agents, and thus partitions the group into backbone agents and non-backbone agents. The connectedness of the system is maintained at two levels: motion of backbone agents is controlled to maintain existing connections in the backbone; motion of non-backbone agents is determined via a leader-follower formation control method with backbone agents as the leaders. Key advantages of the proposed approach are that it can deal with arbitrary system topologies, it is a distributed method, it uses only two-hop neighbor information, and has low communication cost.",

This control gives the constant internal force balancing at desired posture as feedforward input, based on the EP hypothesis in physiology. From the result, we point out that the biarticular muscles can reduce the convergent time of the motion, and they also can stabilize the system.",

        "abstract": "A Skilligent robot must be able to learn skills autonomously to accomplish a task. ldquoskilligencerdquo is the capacity of the robot to control behaviors reasonably, based on the skills acquired during run-time. Behavior control based on Bayesian networks is used to control reasonable behaviors. To accomplish this, subgoals are first discovered by clustering similar features of state transition tuples, which are composed of current states, actions, and next states. Here, features used in clustering are produced using changes of the states in the state transition tuples. Parameters of Bayesian networks and utility functions are learned separately using state transition tuples belonging to each subgoal. To select the best action while executing a task, the expected utility of each subgoal is calculated by the expected utility function and the robot chooses the action that maximizes expected utility calculated by the maximum expected utility (MEU) function. The MEU function is based on the conditional probabilistic distributions of Bayesian networks and utility functions. We also propose a method for reconstructing learned networks and increasing subgoals by incremental learning. To show the validities of our proposed methods, a task using dribbling-box-into-a-goal (DBIG) and obstacle-avoidance-while-dribbling-box (OAWDB) skills is simulated and experimented.",

        "abstract": "For people with very severe motor dysfunctions, Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) may provide the solution to regain mobility and manipulation capabilities. Unfortunately, BCIs are characterized by a limited bandwidth and uncertainty on the BCI output. In the past, we have developed a Bayesian plan recognition framework that estimates from uncertain human-robot interface signals the task a robot should execute. This paper extends our plan recognition framework to incorporate uncertain BCI signals. A benchmark test is proposed and adopted to evaluate both the plan recognition framework and the performance of the BCI user, for the concrete application of wheelchair driving.",

We present the use of Bayesian surprise, introduced in computer vision, for landmark detection. Further, we provide a novel hierarchical, graphical model for the appearance of a place and use this model to perform surprise-based landmark detection. Our scheme is agnostic to the sensor type, and we demonstrate this by implementing a simple laser model for computing surprise. We evaluate our landmark detector using appearance and laser measurements in the context of a topological mapping algorithm, thus demonstrating the practical applicability of the detector.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a multiple robot control algorithm to approach the problem of patrolling an open or closed line. The algorithm is fully decentralized, i.e., no communication occurs between robots or with a central station. Robots behave according only to their sensing and computing capabilities to ensure high scalability and robustness towards robots' fault. The patrolling algorithm is designed in the framework of behavioral control and it is based on the concept of Action: an higher level of abstraction with respect to the behaviors. Each Action is obtained by combining more elementary behaviors in the Null-Space-Behavioral framework. A Finite-State-Automata is designed as supervisor in charge of selecting the appropriate action. The approach has been validated in simulation as well as experimentally with a patrol of 3 Pioneer robots available at the Distributed Intelligence Laboratory of the University of Tennessee.",

Here we present parametrizations of contact deformations of planar loops with revolute joints. We show that the bending and kissing loci, which include the self-contact subspace DSContact (generally as a strict subset) can be efficiently described by triangle-based parameters.

Wave-variable-based controllers can support the stable operation of force-reflecting teleoperators under arbitrary communication delays. Transparency in such systems is compromised in order to maintain stability. We had previously proposed a modified wave variable controller that implemented additional wave impedance in the wave variable transformations in order to focus more closely on force tracking. In this paper, we present a new controller for bilateral teleoperators based on the modified wave variable control method which provides superior position and force tracking performance compared to the traditional wave-variable-based method. Moreover, the method has high stability. Theoretical investigation and experimental results confirm the performance of this new controller.",

This article presents an improved modification of the original dynamic movement primitive (DMP) framework by Ijspeert et al [1], [2]. The new equations can generalize movements to new targets without singularities and large accelerations. Furthermore, the new equations can represent a movement in 3D task space without depending on the choice of coordinate system (invariance under invertible affine transformations). Our modified DMP is motivated from biological data (spinal-cord stimulation in frogs) and human behavioral experiments. We further extend the formalism to obstacle avoidance by exploiting the robustness against perturbations: an additional term is added to the differential equations to make the robot steer around an obstacle. This additional term empirically describes human obstacle avoidance. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using the Sarcos Slave robot arm: after learning a single placing movement, the robot placed a cup between two arbitrarily given positions and avoided approaching obstacles.",

Both of the robot's wings were driven by a single power actuator and 1-DOF mechanical transmission-making independent control of both wings, and therefore asymmetric flapping and the generation of a net body torque, impossible. This paper presents a method to modulate body torques by altering the kinematics of each wing transmission independently, via the introduction of two additional control actuators.

The robot consists of a linear motor actuating a machined aluminum paddle. The curvature of this paddle keeps the ball from falling off while the apex height of the ball is stabilized by decelerating the paddle at impact. We analyze the mapping of perturbations of the nominal trajectory over a single bounce to determine the design parameters that stabilize the system. The first robot prototype confirms the results from the stability analysis and exhibits substantial robustness to perturbations in the horizontal degree of freedoms. We then measure the performance of the robot and characterize the noise introduced into the system as white noise. This allows us to refine the design parameters by minimizing the H2 norm of an input-output representation of the system. Finally, we design an H2 optimal controller for the apex height using impact time measurements as feedback and show that the closed-loop performance is only marginally better than what is achieved with open-loop control.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents two bounded attitude control laws of a high frequency Flapping Micro Aerial Vehicle (FMAV) based on sensors measurements feedback. First, a simplified model of a FMAV is proposed using only the steady aerodynamic efforts. Since solely the averaged forces and torques affect the body's movement, the control laws are computed using the averaged model and applied to the time varying model at the beginning of each wingbeat period. A first control law is developed using a rate gyro (measuring the body's angular velocity), and some reference sensors used to compute the attitude error. A second control law is proposed omitting the rate gyro in order to reduce FMAV's size and weight. The control laws are highly simple and bounded in order to prevent the saturation of the actuators and to increase their efficiency. The control strategies are compared and tested with respect to external disturbances.",

Our approach can handle all triangulated models and makes no assumption about the underlying geometry and topology. The algorithm uses the notion of conservative advancement (CA), originally developed for convex polytopes. We extend this formulation to general models using swept sphere volume hierarchy and present a compact formulation to compute the motion bounds along with a novel controlling scheme. We have implemented the algorithm and highlight its performance on various benchmarks. In practice, our algorithm can perform continuous collision queries in few milli-seconds on models composed of tens of thousands of triangles.",

        "abstract": "Existing high-dimensional motion planning algorithms are simultaneously overpowered and underpowered. In domains sparsely populated by obstacles, the heuristics used by sampling-based planners to navigate \u201cnarrow passages\u201d can be needlessly complex; furthermore, additional post-processing is required to remove the jerky or extraneous motions from the paths that such planners generate. In this paper, we present CHOMP, a novel method for continuous path refinement that uses covariant gradient techniques to improve the quality of sampled trajectories. Our optimization technique both optimizes higher-order dynamics and is able to converge over a wider range of input paths relative to previous path optimization strategies. In particular, we relax the collision-free feasibility prerequisite on input paths required by those strategies. As a result, CHOMP can be used as a standalone motion planner in many real-world planning queries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in manipulation planning for a 6-DOF robotic arm as well as in trajectory generation for a walking quadruped robot.",

In this paper we present CI-Graph, a submapping method for SLAM that uses a graph structure to efficiently solve complex trajectories reducing the computational cost. Unlike other submapping SLAM approaches, we are able to transmit and share information through maps in the graph in a consistent manner by using conditionally independent submaps. In addition, the current submap always summarizes, without further computations, all information available making CI-Graph be an intrinsically \u201cup to date\u201d algorithm. Moreover, the technique is also efficient in memory requirements since it does not need to recover the full covariance matrix. To evaluate CI-Graph performance, the method has been tested using a synthetic Manhattan world and Victoria Park data set.",

A remote center of motion is obtained with a serial architecture, and parallel mechanisms in configurations close to singularity are used to increase the workspace.

        "abstract": "In recent years, flagellar motors of bacteria have not only inspired design of an entirely new category of microrobots, they have also been interfaced with synthetic components and used for controlled actuation of microscale objects. The ultimate goal of these efforts is to develop bio-hybrid swimming micro-robots which use bacteria for actuation, control, and sensing. As bacteria begin to become an integral part of microscale engineered systems, there is a great need for characterizing their performance and understanding the forces involved in interfacing them with synthetic components. In this work repeatability and endurance (performance as a function of time) of an ensemble of bacteria used for actuation of 10 mum polystyrene micro-beads are characterized. Moreover, a series of adhesion assay methods are introduced and used to determine the strength and timeline of adhesion of Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens) bacteria to hydrophobic and hydrophilic polystyrene surfaces.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a detailed characterization of the Hokuyo URG-04LX 2D laser range finder. While the sensor specifications only provide a rough estimation of the sensor accuracy, the present work analyzes issues such as time drift effects and dependencies on distance, target properties (color, brightness and material) as well as incidence angle. Since the sensor is intended to be used for measurements of a tubelike environment on an inspection robot, the characterization is extended by investigating the influence of the sensor orientation and dependency on lighting conditions. The sensor characteristics are compared to those of the Sick LMS 200 which is commonly used in robotic applications when size and weight are not critical constraints. The results show that the sensor accuracy is strongly depending on the target properties (color, brightness, material) and that it is consequently difficult to establish a calibration model. The paper also identifies cases for which the sensor returns faulty measurements, mainly when the surface has low reflectivity (dark surfaces, foam) or for high incidence angles on shiny surfaces. On the other hand, the repeatability of the sensor seems to be competitive with the LMS 200.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Prior research in biology and mechanics has shown the importance of hierarchy to the performance of dry adhesive systems on rough surfaces. The gecko utilizes several levels of hierarchy that operate on length scales from millimeters to 100s of nanometers in order to maneuver on smooth and rough vertical surfaces ranging from glass to rock. The gecko's hierarchical system serves two main purposes: it permits conformation to the surface for a large effective area of contact, and it distributes the load evenly among contacting elements. We present a new two-tiered directional adhesive system that provides these capabilities for a gecko-inspired climbing robot. The distal features consist of wedge-shaped structures with a base width of 50 mum and a height of approximately 180 mum. The wedges are mounted atop angled cylindrical features, 380 mum in diameter by approximately 1 mm long. Together, the proximal and distal features bend preferentially in the direction of inclination when loaded with a tangential force, achieving a combination of directional adhesion and conformation to rough surfaces. Using this system, a four legged robot that was previously restricted to climbing smooth surfaces is able to climb vertical surfaces such as a wood panels, painted metals, and plastics. On rougher surfaces, the two-tiered system improves adhesion by a factor of five compared to the wedge features alone. The hierarchical system also improved alignment and performance for large patch sizes.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a deformable-model-driven method to recognize the state of hanging clothes using three-dimensional (3D) observed data. For the task to pick up a specific part of the clothes, it is indispensable to obtain the 3D position and posture of the part. In order to robustly obtain such information from 3D observed data of the clothes, we take a deformable-model-driven approach[4], that recognizes the clothes state by comparing the observed data with candidate shapes which are predicted in advance. To carry out this approach despite large shape variation of the clothes, we propose a two-staged method. First, small number of representative 3D shapes are calculated through physical simulations of hanging the clothes. Then, after observing clothes, each representative shape is deformed so as to fit the observed 3D data better. The consistency between the adjusted shapes and the observed data is checked to select the correct state. Experimental results using actual observations have shown the good prospect of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents ICS-AVOID, a collision avoidance scheme based upon the concept of Inevitable Collision State (ICS), ie a state for which, no matter what the future trajectory of the robotic system is, a collision eventually occurs. By design, ICS-AVOID can handle dynamic environments since ICS do take into account the future behaviour of moving objects. ICS-AVOID is designed to keep the system away from ICS. By doing so, motion safety is guaranteed (by definition a robotic system in a non-ICS state has at least one collision-free trajectory that it can use). To demonstrate the efficiency of ICS-AVOID, it has been extensively compared with two state-of-the-art collision avoidance schemes: the first one is built upon the Dynamic Window approach and the second one on the Velocity Obstacle concept. The results obtained show that, when provided with the same amount of information about the future evolution of the environment, ICS-AVOID outperforms the other two schemes. The first reason for this has to do with the extent to which each collision avoidance scheme reasons about the future. The second reason has to do with the ability of each collision avoidance scheme to find a safe control if one exists. ICS-AVOID is the only one which is complete in this respect thanks to the concept of Safe Control Kernel.",

The method uses color based invariant gradients that emphasize material changes and extract relevant and invariant features for detection while neglecting shadow contours. This method allows to train and detect objects and scenes independently of scene illumination, cast and self shadows. Moreover, it allows to do training in one shot, that is, when the robot visits the scene for the first time.",

General Purpose manipulation with a robot (eg. delivering dishes, opening doors with a key, etc.) is demanding. It is hard because (1) objects are constrained in position and orientation, (2) many non-spatial constraints interact (or interfere) with each other, and (3) robots may have multi-degree of freedoms (DOF). In this paper we solve the problem of general purpose robotic manipulation using a novel combination of planning and motion planning. Our approach integrates motions of a robot with other (non-physical or external-to-robot) actions to achieve a goal while manipulating objects. It differs from previous, hierarchical approaches in that (a) it considers kinematic constraints in configuration space (C-space) together with constraints over object manipulations; (b) it automatically generates high-level (logical) actions from a C-space based motion planning algorithm; and (c) it decomposes a planning problem into small segments, thus reducing the complexity of planning.",

        "abstract": "We explore the interconnection between search and action in the context of mobile robotics. The task of searching for an object and then performing some action with that object is important in many applications. Of particular interest to us is the idea of a robot assistant capable of performing worthwhile tasks around the home and office (e.g., fetching coffee, washing dirty dishes, etc.). We prove that some tasks allow for search and action to be completely decoupled and solved separately, while other tasks require the problems to be analyzed together. We complement our theoretical results with the design of a combined search/action approximation algorithm that draws on prior work in search. We show the effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing it to state-of-the-art solvers, and we give empirical evidence showing that search and action can be decoupled for some useful tasks. Finally, we demonstrate our algorithm on an autonomous mobile robot performing object search and delivery in an office environment.",

These advances have often been presented as a result of, or together with, a new local image descriptor. This paper examines how the performance for such a system varies with choice of local descriptor. This is done by comparing the performance of a full 6 degree-of-freedom pose estimation system for fourteen types of local descriptors. The evaluation is done on a database with photos of complex objects with simple and complex backgrounds and varying lighting conditions. From the experiments we can conclude that duplet features, that use pairs of interest points, improve pose estimation accuracy, and that affine covariant features do not work well in current pose estimation frameworks. The data sets and their ground truth is available on the Web to allow future comparison with novel algorithms.",

One of the most crucial prerequisites for object recognition is a set of fast algorithms for geometry segmentation and extraction, which in turn rely on surface normal vectors as a fundamental feature. Although there exists a plethora of different approaches for estimating normal vectors from 3D point clouds, it is largely unclear which methods are preferable for online processing on a mobile robot. This paper presents a detailed analysis and comparison of existing methods for surface normal estimation with a special emphasis on the trade-off between quality and speed. The study sheds light on the computational complexity as well as the qualitative differences between methods and provides guidelines on choosing the dasiarightpsila algorithm for the robotics practitioner. The robustness of the methods with respect to noise and neighborhood size is analyzed. All algorithms are benchmarked with simulated as well as real 3D laser data obtained from a mobile robot.",

The RHILS platform involves physical joint modules and the control unit to reduce modeling complexities while taking into account various physical phenomena. The LM methodology simplifies the multi-objective constrained optimization problem into a single-objective unconstrained formulation and also brings subjective notions of design into the scope.

We rely on the inconsistency of information among sonar measurements and the sound pressure of the waves from the sonar sensors to develop a new method of detecting incorrect sonar readings, called the conflict evaluation with sound pressure (CEsp). To fuse the correct measurements into a map, we start with the maximum likelihood approach due to its ability to manage the angular uncertainty of sonar sensors. However, since this approach suffers from heavy computational complexity, we convert it to a light logic problem called the maximum approximated likelihood (MAL) approach. Integrating the MAL approach with the CEsp method results in the conflict-evaluated maximum approximated likelihood (CEMAL) approach. The CEMAL approach generates a very accurate map that is close to the map that would be built by accurate laser sensors, and does not require adjustment of parameters for various environments.",

        "abstract": "In cooperative navigation, teams of mobile robots obtain range and/or angle measurements to each other and dead-reckoning information to help each other navigate more accurately. One typical approach is moving baseline navigation, in which multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) exchange range measurements using acoustic modems to perform mobile trilateration. While the sharing of information between vehicles can be highly beneficial, exchanging measurements and state estimates can also be dangerous because of the risk of measurements being used by a vehicle more than once; such data re-use leads to inconsistent (overconfident) estimates, making data association and outlier rejection more difficult and divergence more likely. In this paper, we present a technique for the consistent cooperative localization of multiple AUVs performing mobile trilateration. Each AUV establishes a bank of filters, performing careful bookkeeping to track the origins of measurements and prevent the use any of the measurements more than once. The multiple estimates are combined in a consistent manner, yielding conservative covariance estimates. The technique is illustrated using simulation results. The new method is compared side-by-side with a naive approach that does not keep track of the origins of measurements, illustrating that the new method keeps conservative covariance bounds whereas state estimates obtained with the naive approach become overconfident and diverge.",

Using such sensor data is tricky, especially when the resulting position belief is stretched over a larger area. Constraints can overcome this limitations, as they have several advantages: they can represent large distributions and are easy to store and to communicate to other robots. Propagation of several constraints can be computationally cheap. Even high dimensional belief functions can be used. We will describe a sample implementation and show experimental results.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Continuous action sets are used in many reinforcement learning (RL) applications in robot control since the control input is continuous. However, discrete action sets also have the advantages of ease of implementation and compatibility with some sophisticated RL methods, such as the Dyna [1]. However, one of the problem is the absence of general principles on designing a discrete action set for robot control in higher dimensional input space. In this paper, we propose to construct a discrete action set given a set of basis functions (BFs). We designed the action set so that the size of the set is proportional to the number of the BFs. This method can exploit the function approximator's nature, that is, in practical RL applications, the number of BFs does not increase exponentially with the dimension of the state space (e.g. [2]). Thus, the size of the proposed action set does not increase exponentially with the dimension of the input space. We apply an RL with the proposed action set to a robot navigation task and a crawling and a jumping tasks. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed action set has the advantages of improved learning speed, and better ability to acquire performance, compared to a conventional discrete action set.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a new statistical modeling technique for building occupancy maps. The problem of mapping is addressed as a classification task where the robot's environment is classified into regions of occupancy and unoccupancy. Our model provides both a continuous representation of the robot's surroundings and an associated predictive variance. This is obtained by employing a Gaussian process as a non-parametric Bayesian learning technique to exploit the fact that real-world environments inherently possess structure. This structure introduces a correlation between points on the map which is not accounted for by many common mapping techniques such as occupancy grids. Using a trained neural network covariance function to model the highly non-stationary datasets, it is possible to generate accurate representations of large environments at resolutions which suit the desired applications while also providing inferences into occluded regions, between beams, and beyond the range of the sensor, even with relatively few sensor readings. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach in a simulated data set with known ground-truth, and in an outdoor urban environment covering an area of 120,000 m2.",

        "abstract": "Scan-matching is a technique that can be used for building accurate maps and estimating vehicle motion by comparing a sequence of point cloud measurements of the environment taken from a moving sensor. One challenge that arises in mapping applications where the sensor motion is fast relative to the measurement time is that scans become locally distorted and difficult to align. This problem is common when using 3D laser range sensors, which typically require more scanning time than their 2D counterparts. Existing 3D mapping solutions either eliminate sensor motion by taking a \u201cstop-and-scan\u201d approach, or attempt to correct the motion in an open-loop fashion using odometric or inertial sensors. We propose a solution to 3D scan-matching in which a continuous 6DOF sensor trajectory is recovered to correct the point cloud alignments, producing locally accurate maps and allowing for a reliable estimate of the vehicle motion. Our method is applied to data collected from a 3D spinning lidar sensor mounted on a skid-steer loader vehicle to produce quality maps of outdoor scenes and estimates of the vehicle trajectory during the mapping sequences.",

        "abstract": "A continuous vocal imitation system was developed using a computational model that explains the process of phoneme acquisition by infants. Human infants perceive speech sounds not as discrete phoneme sequences but as continuous acoustic signals. One of critical problems in phoneme acquisition is the design for segmenting these continuous speech sounds. The key idea to solve this problem is that articulatory mechanisms such as the vocal tract help human beings to perceive speech sound units corresponding to phonemes. To segment acoustic signal with articulatory movement, we apply the segmenting method to our system by Recurrent Neural Network with Parametric Bias (RNNPB). This method determines the multiple segmentation boundaries in a temporal sequence using the prediction error of the RNNPB model, and the PB values obtained by the method can be encoded as kind of phonemes. Our system was implemented by using a physical vocal tract model, called the Maeda model. Experimental results demonstrated that our system can self-organize the same phonemes in different continuous sounds, and can imitate vocal sound involving arbitrary numbers of vowels using the vowel space in the RNNPB. This suggests that our model reflects the process of phoneme acquisition.",

The throwing manipulation enables the robot not only to manipulate the object to outside of the movable range of the robot, but also to control the position of the object arbitrarily in the vertical plane even though the robot has only one degree of freedom. In the throwing manipulation, the robot motion is dynamic and quick, and the contact state between the robot and the object changes. These make it difficult to obtain the exact model and solve its inverse problem. In addition, since the throwing manipulation requires more powerful actuators than the static manipulation, we should set the control input by taking consideration of the performance limits of the actuators. The present paper proposes the control strategy based on the iteration optimization learning to overcome the above problems and verifies its effectiveness experimentally.",

        "abstract": "A control approach for a class of underactuated vehicles with the objective of stabilizing reference trajectories either in velocity or position is proposed. The basic modeling assumption is that the vehicle is propulsed via a thrust force along a single body-fixed direction and that it has full torque actuation for attitude control (i.e. a typical actuation structure for aircrafts, vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) vehicles, submarines, etc.). Additional assumptions on the external forces applied to the vehicle are also introduced for the sake of control design and stability analyses. They are best satisfied for vehicles whose shape induces lift forces with limited amplitude and which are subjected to an external force field (e.g. gravity), as in the case of VTOL vehicles. The interactions of the vehicle with the surrounding fluid are often difficult to model precisely and they may significantly perturb its motion. Some novel nonlinear feedback control laws are proposed to compensate for modeling errors and perform robustly against such perturbations. Simulation results illustrating these properties on a realistic model of a VTOL vehicle are reported.",

The five links coupled by the five joints form a closed-loop. The four steering systems are attached to four of the five links. Each of the four links has its own steering system at its middle point. The wheeled locomotor transforms the rotations of the five joints into movement by using the four steering systems. This means that the wheeled locomotor performs undulatory locomotion in which it transforms a change in its internal shape into the generation of its net displacement. In addition, a virtual joint is added to one of the ends of the first link. The virtual joint couples the first link and a virtual link which has a virtual axle at its middle point and a virtual steering system at its end. It is proven that, by assuming the presence of such virtual mechanical elements, it is possible to convert the kinematic equation of the wheeled locomotor into a five-chain, single-generator chained form in differential geometry. Based on chained form, a path-following feedback control method that enables the wheeled locomotor to follow a straight line is derived. The validity of the mechanical design of the wheeled locomotor, the transformation of its kinematic equation into chained form, and the path-following feedback control method is verified by computer simulation.",

        "abstract": "We present a method for controlling the forward speed and the apex height of a one-legged hopping robot over rough terrain, using a single actuator located at the robot hip. The control algorithm is comprised of two elements, the forward speed control and the height control. The only input to the system is the torque applied by the hip actuator. The control is demonstrated to perform tracking of desired forward speed trajectories and desired apex height trajectories. Simulation and experimental results on the SAHR (Single Actuator Hopping Robot) experimental setup are presented and compared. It is shown that the robot follows both trajectories closely in simulation as well as in experiment. Also the robot is tested successfully on a rough terrain course, which includes inclined ground and an abrupt drop in height of over 25% the length of the robot leg. The robot has no knowledge of its environment. Further, the robot is made to run over the course a number of times, to demonstrate the control robustness.",

One of the challenges with mobile manipulators is the construction of control systems, enabling the robot to operate safely in potentially dynamic environments. In this paper we will present work in which a mobile manipulator is controlled using the dynamical systems approach. The method presented is a two level approach in which competitive dynamics are used both for the overall coordination of the mobile platform and the manipulator as well as the lower level fusion of obstacle avoidance and target acquisition behaviors.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a suspended mobile platform with two 3 DOF manipulators, is used to manipulate an object in a combined circular-straight path. The multiple impedance control (MIC) is used as a model-based algorithm which has been shown to have desirable performance in case of impact with an obstacle and system flexibility. The MIC enforces same impedance law both on the robotic system, and the manipulated object level. However, to apply model-based control laws, it is needed to extract system dynamics model. For such complicated robotic systems with suspension system, it is necessary to have a concise set of dynamic equations of motion with few mathematical calculations. Therefore, the concept of direct path method is extended to derive explicit dynamics modeling for such challenging systems. Then, non-holonomic constraint of the wheeled system is derived, and the obtained dynamics model is reformatted to become a more concise one using natural orthogonal complement method. Next, the MIC law is applied to cooperative manipulation of an object by two manipulators mounted on a suspended wheeled robotic system. The obtained results reveal a smooth system performance, i.e. negligible small tracking errors in the presence of impacts with obstacles and significant disturbances.",

The uncertainty estimation offers a tool to build and analyze hybrid control systems such as switching or partitioning control. In earlier works, position-based and 2.5D servoing have been analysed. This work extends the approach to the analysis of closed loop uncertainty, showing how the path uncertainty can be approximated. The uncertainty is analyzed in Cartesian reference to make the approach general over different hardware. In addition, we show how image-based visual servoing can be analysed using the same approach.",

They are designed based on the robot dynamics and coupled with each other, and it requires lots of calculation to obtain them. So far, we have proposed controller design method based on orbit attractor of nonlinear dynamics. Because the controller yields one motion for one robot, we can assume that the controller includes information of motion and body elements. If those elements can be decomposed from the controller, a new controller can be easily designed by the combination of these elements. So in this paper, we propose the motion and body elements design method with Lagrange's method of undetermined multipliers based on robot dynamics, and combination design method of a new controller using these elements. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by experiments with tapping dance robots.",

        "abstract": "A flexible needle can be accurately steered by robotically controlling the orientation of the bevel tip as the needle is inserted into tissue. Here, we demonstrate the significant effect of friction between the long, flexible needle shaft and the tissue, which can cause a significant discrepancy between the orientation of the needle tip and the orientation of the base where the needle is controlled. Our experiments show that several common phantom tissues used in needle steering experiments impart substantial frictional forces to the needle shaft, resulting in a lag of over 45deg for a 10 cm insertion depth in some phantoms; clinical studies have reported torques large enough to could cause similar errors during needle insertions. Such angle discrepancies will result in poor performance or failure of path planners and image-guided controllers, since the needles used in percutaneous procedures are too small for state-of-the-art imaging to accurately measure the tip angle. To compensate for the angle discrepancy, we develop a model for the rotational dynamics of a needle being continuously inserted into tissue and show how a PD controller is sufficient to compensate for the rotational dynamics.",

Specifically, we present minimum mean square error (MMSE) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators that can process measurements quantized with as little as one bit per measurement. During CL, each robot quantizes and broadcasts its measurements and receives the quantized observations of its teammates. The quantization process is based on the appropriate selection of thresholds, computed using the current state estimates, that minimize the estimation error metric considered. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed Iteratively-Quantized Extended Kalman filter (IQEKF) and the Iteratively Quantized MAP (IQMAP) estimator achieve performance indistinguishable of that of their real-valued counterparts (EKF and MAP, respectively) when using as few as 4 bits for quantizing each robot measurement.",

A model of a system of input-constrained non-holonomic agents is constructed, suitable for use with formal verification tools. The agents considered are uniform and have bounded velocities and limited turning capabilities. We demonstrate how a model checker can be used to generate a counterexample trace for such a system, usable as a trajectory that satisfies our safety and liveness requirements.",

We also describe topological transition graphs that can visualize crawling from each initial contact condition. We then discuss the characteristics of the proposed robot in terms of design freedom. Finally, we show experimentally that the prototype of a tensegrity robot can crawl.",

This paper proposes the use of an MSIS (mechanically scanned imaging sonar) for relative positioning of a robot with respect to the wall. An imaging sonar gathers polar image scans from which depth images (range & bearing) are generated. Depth scans are first processed to extract a line corresponding to the wall (with the Hough transform), which is then tracked by means of an EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) using a static motion model and an implicit measurement equation associating the sensed points to the candidate line. The line estimate is referenced to the robot fixed frame and represented in polar coordinates (rho&thetas) which directly corresponds to the actual distance and relative orientation of the robot with respect to the wall. The proposed system has been tested in simulation as well as in water tank conditions.",

In this work, it has been noted that three visual features (to control three degrees of freedom) obtained from the spherical projection of 3D spheres allows nice decoupling properties and global stability. However, even if such an approach is theoretically attractive, it is limited by a major practical issue since spherical objects have to be observed while only three degrees of freedom can be controlled. In this paper, we show that similar properties can be obtained by observing a set of points. The basic idea is to build a virtual 3D sphere from two 3D points and to analyse its related spherical projection. Furthermore, to control the six degrees of freedom a 2D 1/2 control scheme is proposed which allows us to fully decouple rotational motions from translational motions.",

Deformation of a belt object such as film circuit boards or flexible circuit boards must be estimated for automatic manipulation and assembly. First, the fishbone model to describe deformation of a rectangular belt object is explained. In this model, the object shape is represented by the curved ldquospine linerdquo and straight ldquorib linesrdquo. We can estimate deformation of the object by minimizing its potential energy under geometric constraints. Next, this model is modified to represent deformation in which the rib line at an endpoint does not coincide with the transverse edge. Moreover, the modified model is applied to a belt object with angles. The deformed shape of an angled object can be derived by separating it into rectangular parts and angled parts and by assuming that each angled part forms a part of a cylindrical surface. Finally, the validity of our proposed model is verified by comparing the computed shape of an L-shaped belt object with its measured shape.",

By choosing Lyapunov Krasovskii functional, we show that the master-slave teleoperation system is asymptotically stable under specific LMI conditions. With the given controller design parameters, the proposed stability criteria can be used to compute the allowable maximum delay values.

Particularly, a Decentralized Delayed-State Extended Information Filter (DDSEIF) is described, where full state trajectories are considered to fuse the information. This permits to obtain an estimation equal to that obtained by a centralized system, and allows delays and latency in the communications. The sparseness of the information matrix maintains the communications overhead at a reasonable level. The method is applied to cooperative tracking and some results in disaster management scenarios are shown. In this kind of scenarios the target might move in both open field and indoor areas, so fusion of data provided by heterogeneous sensors is beneficial.",

        "abstract": "Many robotic hands or prosthetic hands have been developed in the last several decades, and many use tendon-driven mechanisms for their transmissions. Robotic hands are now built with underactuated mechanisms, which have fewer actuators than degrees of freedom, to reduce mechanical complexity or to realize a biomimetic motion such as flexion of an index finger. The design is heuristic and it is useful to develop design methods for the underactuated mechanisms. This paper classifies mechanisms driven by tendons into three classes, and proposes a design method for them. The two classes are related to underactuated tendon-driven mechanisms, and these have been used without distinction so far. An index finger robot, which has four active tendons and two passive tendons, is developed and controlled with the proposed method.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a 3-DOF low-cost hand-held micromanipulator driven by 3 piezoelectric actuators and built using rapid prototyping. Traditional pin and ball joints have been commonly replaced by flexure-based methods in the field of micromanipulation. Utilization of flexure-based joints have several advantages like the non-existence of backlash and assembly errors. However, most of the present flexure-based mechanisms are bulky and not suitable for hand-held applications. It is difficult and expensive to make such compact mechanism using traditional machining methods. In additional, traditional machining methods are limited to simple design. To reduce the cost of fabrication and also to allow more complex designs, Objet (a rapid prototyping machine) is proposed to be used to build the mechanism. With regards to hand-held applications, the size of the mechanism is a constraint. Hence, a parallel manipulator design is the preferred choice as compared to a serial mechanism because of its rigidity, compactness, and simplicity in design. For the illustration of an application, the mechanism is designed with an intraocular needle attached to it. Possible applications of this design include enhancement of performance in microsurgery and cell micromanipulation. Experiments are also conducted to evaluate the manipulator's tracking performance of the needle tip at a frequency of 10 Hz.",

This system is capable of deriving linear acceleration, angular acceleration and angular velocity via simple matrix operations, and it also releases the requirement of accelerometer installation at the center of mass as in the traditional IMU. An optimal configuration of the system is proposed based on the analysis of rigid body dynamics and matrix theory. We performed error analyses, including position, orientation, and sensor noise, and we also report the results of experimental evaluation. We believe the analysis presented in this paper would benefit the practical design of IMUs in the future.",

The orthosis is an energetically passive, controllable device which 1) unidirectionally couples hip to knee flexion; 2) aids hip and knee flexion with a spring assist; and 3) incorporates sensors and modulated friction brakes, which are used in conjunction with electrical stimulation for the feedback control of joint (and therefore limb) trajectories. This paper describes the hybrid FES approach and the design of the joint coupled orthosis. A dynamic simulation of an SCI individual using the hybrid approach is described, and results from the simulation are presented that indicate the promise of the JCO approach.",

The performance indices that are optimized include wrench-closure workspace, isotropy of the wrench-closure workspace, and kinematic conditioning index. Stiffness is used to define a safety margin from singularities of wrench closure. A design example of a wire-actuated surgical wrist is presented and validated through simulation. The methods presented in this paper are useful for quick dimensional synthesis of wire-actuated wrists with predefined wrench-closure workspaces.",

However, little research has studied virtual fixtures that provide moving force constraints based on motion of the environment, e.g., organ movement due to heartbeat or respiration. This work discusses design considerations of moving forbidden-region virtual fixtures and presents two methods of implementation: predicted-position and current-position virtual fixtures. Human subject experiments were performed to determine the effectiveness of moving virtual fixtures when interacting with an object in motion using a teleoperator. Results show that moving virtual fixtures can help improve user precision and decrease the amount of force applied.",

Although some studies in the field of control systems have been helpful in reducing the mechanical impedance of actuators, they have not been able to remove the inertia of robot hardware. This paper introduces an alternative design in which mechanical links are utilized. The mechanical links are driven by one actuator without any complicated servo systems. The design parameters are optimized for the link system to generate the normal walking motion. The simulation data shows that the normal gait patterns are realized successfully. The device is connected to a patient using elastic components, and therefore the inertia of the robot is not directly imposed on the patient. The patient's legs are guided to follow the motion of the robot with the forces generated by the elastic components.",

        "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a technique for influencing brain function though the use of implanted electrodes. Direct magnetic resonance (MR) image guidance during DBS insertion would provide many benefits; most significantly, interventional MRI can be used for planning, monitoring of tissue deformation, real-time visualization of insertion, and confirmation of placement. The accuracy of standard stereotactic insertion is limited by registration errors and brain movement during surgery. With real-time acquisition of high-resolution MR images during insertion, probe placement can be confirmed intra-operatively. Direct MR guidance has not yet taken hold because it is often confounded by a number of issues including: MR-compatibility of existing stereotactic surgery equipment and patient access in the scanner bore. The high resolution images required for neurosurgical planning and guidance require high-field MR (1.5-3 T); thus, any system must be capable of working within the constraints of a closed, long-bore diagnostic magnet. Currently, no technological solution exists to assist MRI guided neurosurgical interventions in an accurate, simple, and economical manner.We present the design of a robotic assistant system that overcomes these difficulties and promises safe and reliable electrode placement in the brain inside closed high-field MRI scanners. The robot performs the insertion under real-time 3 T MR image guidance. This paper described analysis of the workspace requirements, MR compatibility evaluation, and mechanism design.",

First of all, we made clear functional requirements for such a new generation robot, amounting to fifteen items to consolidate five significant functions such as ldquosafetyrdquo, ldquofriendlinessrdquo, ldquodexterityrdquo, ldquohigh-powerrdquo and ldquomobilityrdquo. In addition, we set task scenes in daily life where support by robot is useful for old women living alone, in order to deduce specifications for the robot. Based on them, we successfully developed a new generation of human symbiotic robot, TWENDY-ONE that has a head, trunk, dual arms with a compact passive mechanism, anthropomorphic dual hands with mechanical softness in joints and skins and an omni-wheeled vehicle. Evaluation experiments focusing on attendant care and kitchen supports using TWENDY-ONE indicate that this new robot will be extremely useful to enhance quality of life for the elderly in the near future where human and robot co-exist.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Path-planning allows one to steer a camera to a desired location while taking into account the presence of constraints such as visibility, workspace, and joint limits. Unfortunately, the planned path can be significantly different from the real path due to the presence of uncertainty on the available data, with the consequence that some constraints may be not fulfilled by the real path even if they are satisfied by the planned path. In this paper we address the problem of performing robust path-planning, i.e. computing a path that satisfies the required constraints not only for the nominal model as in traditional path-planning but rather for a family of admissible models. Specifically, we consider an uncertain model where the point correspondences between the initial and desired views and the camera intrinsic parameters are affected by unknown random uncertainties with known bounds. The difficulty we have to face is that traditional path-planning schemes applied to different models lead to different paths rather than to a common and robust path. To solve this problem we propose a technique based on polynomial optimization where the required constraints are imposed on a number of trajectories corresponding to admissible camera poses and parameterized by a common design variable. The planned image trajectory is then followed by using an IBVS controller. Simulations carried out with all typical uncertainties that characterize a real experiment illustrate the proposed strategy and provide promising results.",

They can be used as a seed to find causal relationships between motions or to obtain contextual information of human activity, which is useful for intelligent systems that support human activity in everyday environment. The major contribution of the proposed method is two-fold: (1) motion density is proposed as a repeatability measure and (2) the problem of finding consecutive time frames with large motion density is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem which is solved via Dynamic Programming (DP) in polynomial time O(N log N) where N is the total amount of data. The proposed method was evaluated by detecting repeated interactions between objects in everyday manipulation tasks and outperformed the previous method in terms of both detectability and computational time.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Needle insertion treatments require accurate placement of the needle tip into the target cancer. However, it is difficult to insert the needle accurately because of cancer displacement caused by organ deformation. Therefore, a path planning using numerical simulation to analyze the deformation of the organ is important for accurate needle insertion. The problem in developing a planning method is that puncture conditions, such as the force applied to the needle, is difficult to be decided deterministically, because the experimental data of puncture conditions have variations. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to develop a novel planning method to decide the robust paths of straight needle insertion for various puncture points. The basic idea of this planning method is to consider the puncture condition probabilistic and to evaluate the expected value of needle placement accuracy. First, a probability-based puncture condition was introduced, and then the expected value of needle placement accuracy was defined. Next, the optimization method was developed to search the insertion path in a way that minimizes the expected values of needle placement accuracy. Then, a numerical simulation and evaluation of the planning method was conducted, using a liver-shaped 2D model. Furthermore, an in-vitro experiment was carried out to measure needle placement accuracy from the optimized path. Experimental results show that the planning method realizes needle insertion with a mean accuracy of 1.5 mm.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In current semiconductor and TFT-LCD factories, periodic sampling is commonly adopted to monitor the stability of manufacturing processes and the quality of products (or workpieces). As for those non-sampled workpieces, their quality is usually monitored by such as a fault-detection-and-classification (FDC) server. However, this method may fail to detect defected products. For example, a workpiece with all the individual manufacturing process parameters being in-spec may still result in out-of-spec product quality. Under this circumstance, unless this certain defected workpiece is selected for sampling by chance, it cannot be detected by simply monitoring the manufacturing process parameters collected from the production equipment. To solve the above mentioned problem, this research proposes a product quality fault detection scheme (FDS), which utilizes the classification and regression tree to implement a model for identifying the relationship between process parameters and out-of-spec products. Through this model, each set of normal manufacturing process parameters can be real-time and on-line examined to detect failure or defected products.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports the development of novel micro-force sensing tools for retinal microsurgery. Retinal microsurgery requires extremely delicate manipulation of retinal tissue, and tool-to-tissue interaction forces are frequently below human perceptual thresholds. Further, the interaction between the tool shaft and sclera makes accurate sensing of forces exerted on the retina very difficult with previously developed force sensing schemes, in which the sensor is located outside the eye. In the work reported here, we incorporate 160 \u00b5m Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) strain sensors into the tool shaft to sense forces distal to the sclera. The sensor is applicable both with robotically manipulated and freehand tools. Preliminary results with a 1 degree-of-freedom (DOF) sensor have demonstrated 0.25 mN resolution, and work is underway to develop 2 and 3 DOF tools. The design and analysis of the force sensing tool is presented with preliminary testing data and some initial experiments using the tool with both freehand and robotic manipulation.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the development of a 2-DOF electrostatic haptic joystick designed for neuroscience studies in an MRI/fMRI. The joystick is fabricated using non-magnetic materials and actuated by two high-power electrostatic motor units which produce various force fields in the horizontal plane. The electrostatic motor is a synchronous drive and thus the positioning of the joystick is achieved in an open-loop control. As for force sensing, a 2-DOF force sensor is developed using non-magnetic materials and optical fibers so as to measure interaction force with a user; hence, the haptic rendering is based on the admittance control scheme that respects the rule of force-in and position-out. The operation of both the actuators and force sensor respects non-magnetic principles. Thus, the haptic joystick into which these components are integrated is expected to have high MR compatibility, although the evaluation of the MR compatibility is beyond the scope of this paper. In this paper, the device performance is evaluated in the normal environment, which verifies the operation of the unique electrostatic haptic device.",

It can also rotate to compensate for hull curvature and to avoid obstacles while performing its task. The blasting operation is modulated by a vision based quality control system that is used by the mission control system to adapt the blasting parameters in order to attain the desired quality levels while maximizing the surface area the robot strips per unit time.",

In contrast to an inverted pendulum with two wheels, such as the Segway Human Transporter, an inverted pendulum using a ball can traverse in any direction without changing its orientation, thereby enabling stable motion. Such robots can be used in place of the two-wheeled robots. The robot proposed in this paper is equipped with three omnidirectional wheels with stepping motors that drive the ball and two sets of rate gyroscopes and accelerometers as attitude sensors. The robot has a simple design; it is controlled with a 16-bit microcontroller and runs on Ni-MH batteries. It can not only stand still but also traverse on floor and pivot around its vertical axis. Inverted pendulum control is applied in two axes for attitude control, and commanded motions are converted into velocity commands for the three wheels.

This impedance requirement applies not only to the surface but also to the actuation mechanisms. The objective of this research is to develop inherently flexible actuator by realizing backdrivability. A class of hydraulic actuation called electro-hydrostatic actuator was applied to knee joint in humanoid robots to satisfy flexibility and large torque output simultaneously. This paper explains the methodology of performance evaluation of actuators and design concept of joint mechanism. Mathematical model of electro-hydrostatic transmission is also presented. Evaluation of backdrivability, inertia modification control, and compliance control of developed mechanism are performed.",

Tactile sensors capable of detecting slippage are necessary for this gripping action to be realized in a robot hand. Heretofore, many slip sensors were developed and produced, but there was not a slip sensor of simple structure practical for installation on fingertips of a robot hand. Therefore, we propose a low-profile/lightweight slip sensor of simple structure. The special properties of pressure conductive rubber are utilized as a detection device in this sensor. In this paper, we discuss the results of trial manufacture and of slip detection property testing of this sensor. Moreover, we will report the results of slip prevention experiments by this prototype slip sensor, and indicate that the pressure conductive rubber is promising as a material of slip sensor.",

The catheter has a one-sided hollow bellows at the tip made of thin polymer membrane. The bellows is composed of a series of folded micro-chambers and microchannels connecting the micro-chambers. The folded-chambers expand on one side by increasing inner water pressure using a syringe, thus the whole bellows bends toward one direction within 0 to 180 degree. This micro active catheter should be useful for safe intravascular surgery in narrow and complicated blood vessels. Moreover, the nonelectrical actuation mechanism of this catheter can be widely applied to micro-actuators and micro-robots which need high safety.",

In proposed mechanism, we utilize 2 different types of elastic elements at fingertip and MP joint (Metacarpa-Phalangeal Joint), respectively, so as to realize soft and stable contact with human body. At fingertip, a hemisphere shaped silicone gum cushion is mounted, while eight cylindrical cushions are placed between the motor and the link inside MP joint. These cushions deform easily and, as a result, absorb external forces exerted from multiple directions. Furthermore the amplitudes and the directions of applied forces can be estimated with the information of changes in the pressure of each cushion.We examined the fundamental characteristics and performance of this finger module through several experiments.",

The main goal is to successfully enable a person that cannot walk without assistance to walk in a straight line a distance of 15 feet. When in disable assist mode this prototype will rely on the user to provide balance control, and thus an external means for balancing will be required, such as crutches or a walker. Power and control is off board and supplied to the Exoskeleton by means of a tether. Rotary Series Elastic Actuators (RSEAs), which have high force fidelity and low impedance were designed to power the joints. This paper describes the design, test results, future work and potential applications of the exoskeleton.",

        "abstract": "The emerging field of medical robotics aims to introduce intelligent tools to assist a physician. The main challenges for developing efficient medical robotic training systems are simulating real-world conditions of the task and assuring training effectiveness. High anatomic fidelity has been achieved in current systems. However, those training systems are designed to reproduce specific conditions of the task (passive training). In this research, we are focusing in developing an airway management training systems designed to reproduce various cases of difficult airway. Such difficulties (i.e. restricted mouth opening, various shapes of oral cavity including tongue swallowing, etc) may provoke traumas on different organs of the patient during an emergency situation. For this purpose, the authors have proposed the development of more advanced training tools. For this purpose, we have focused in embedding sensors and actuators to a conventional patient model towards the development of a patient robot (in previous research, authors have presented the evaluation model which embeds sensors). In this paper, we present an airway training system which embeds actuators into a mannequin. In particular, the mechanism design of the Waseda Kyotokagaku Airway No.2 (WKA-2) is detailed. The WKA-2 is composed of twelve active and one passive degrees of freedom; which are designed to reproduce the various cases of difficult airway. For this purpose, the WKA-2 reproduces the human muscles around the upper airway based on a wire driving mechanisms (a total of sixteen wires are used). In particular, the head of the model is composed of a tongue and mandible with translational and rotational movements around kinematic axis. In addition, we present the details of the kinematic model of WKA-2 which enable the robot to reproduce the airway difficulties. Finally, we presented the design of a tension sensor designed to measure the applied tension on each of the wire driving mechanism of WKA-2.... Show More",

        "abstract": "The research on the development of musical performance robots has been particularly intensified on the last decades. In fact, the development of anthropomorphic robots able of playing musical instruments have been served as a mean for understanding the human motor control from an engineering point of view as well as understanding how to enable the communication between human and robots from an emotional point of view. In particular, our research aims in the development of an anthropomorphic saxophonist robot which is able not only of performing a musical score; but also to interact with other musical performance robots (i.e. Waseda Flutist Robot) at the emotional level of perception. In this year, we have focused on the mechanical design of an anthropomorphic robot Waseda Saxophonist Robot No. 1 (WAS-1); which has been designed for playing an alto saxophone. WAS-1 has a total of 15-DOFs which mechanically reproduces the following organs involved during the saxophone playing: lips (1-DOF), tongue (1-DOF), oral cavity, lungs (air pump: 1-DOF and air valve: 1-DOF) and fingers (11-DOFs). In order to verify the effectiveness of the production of sound, a set of experiments have been proposed. In particular, the characteristics of air flow-pressure, level of mechanical noise, and the ripple effect ratio are presented. Finally, a qualitative evaluation of the sound produced by WAS-1 is presented and discussed. From the experimental results, we have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms to produce the saxophone sound.",

This paper proposes differentiated layer design, that is the adoption of a single elastic material, dividing the overall thickness of the pad into layers with different structural design (e.g. a continuous skin layer coupled with an internal layer with voids). The purpose is to modify the actual pad compliance and the resulting power law; in particular, given the material and the allowable pad thickness, to increase the compliance with respect to a non structured pad. Some possible internal layer structures are described, compatible with rapid prototyping manufacturing. Their compressive behaviors are tested and comparatively evaluated showing that the concept can work and be exploited for useful application.",

To understand mechanical principles of ground-to-air transitions at this particular scale, we investigate the biomechanics of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster during takeoff. Building upon a prior framework (G.M. Card et al., 2008), we analyze the insect's pre-flight motion, and its impact in directionality control. Using a rigid multi-body system comprised by one central body and six legs, we are able to estimate forces from joint kinematics. The approach provides a mathematical framework for studying tradeoffs between directionality control and dynamic stability during flight initiation.",

In the current literature, this is commonly formulated as a locational optimization problem under the assumption that sensing performance is independent of the locations of sensors. We extend this work to a more general framework where the sensor model is location-dependent. We propose a distributed control law and coordination algorithm. If the global sensing performance function is known a priori, we prove that the algorithm is guaranteed to converge. To validate this algorithm, we conduct experiments with indoor and outdoor deployments of Cyclops cameras and model its sensing performance. This model is used to simulate deployments on 1D pathways and study the coverage obtained. We also examine the coverage in the case when the global sensing function is not known and is estimated in an online fashion.",

As opposed to centralized MAP-based CL, the proposed algorithm reduces the memory and processing requirements by distributing data and computations amongst the robots. Specifically, a distributed data-allocation scheme is presented that enables robots to simultaneously process and update their local data. Additionally, a distributed Conjugate Gradient algorithm is employed that reduces the cost of computing the MAP estimates, while utilizing all available resources in the team and increasing robustness to single-point failures. Finally, a computationally efficient distributed marginalization of past robot poses is introduced for limiting the size of the optimization problem. The communication and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is described in detail, while extensive simulation studies are presented for validating the performance of the distributed MAP estimator and comparing its accuracy to that of existing approaches.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a distributed version of our previous work, called SAFDetection, which is a sensor analysis-based fault detection approach that is used to monitor tightly-coupled multi-robot team tasks.While the centralized version of SAFDetection was shown to be successful, a shortcoming of the approach is that it does not scale well to large team sizes. The distributed SAFDetection approach addresses this problem by adapting and distributing the approach across team members. Distributed SAFDetection has the same theoretic foundation as centralized SAFDetection, which maps selected robot sensor data to a robot state by using a clustering algorithm, and builds state transition diagrams to describe the normal behavior of the robot system. However, rather than processing multiple robots' sensor data centralized on a server, distributed SAFDetection performs feature selection and clustering on individual robots to build the normal behavior model of an individual robot and the entire robot team. Fault detection is also accomplished in a distributed manner. We have implemented this distributed approach on a physical robot team and in simulation. This paper presents the results of these experiments, showing that distributed SAFDetection is an efficient approach to detect both local and interactive faults in tightly-coupled multi-robot team tasks. Compared to the centralized version, this approach provides more scalability and reliability.",

        "abstract": "A general technique to build a dynamic and distributed intrusion detector for a class of multi-agent systems is proposed in this paper, by which misbehavior in the motion of one or more agents can be discovered. Previous work from the authors has focused on how to distinguish the behavior of a misbehaving agent in a completely distributed way, by developing a solution where agents act as local monitors of their neighbors and use locally sensed information as well as data received from other monitors at a particular time. In this work, we improve the system detection capability by allowing monitors to use information collected at different instants and thus realizing a dynamic state observer that is valid for any system in the considered class. Finally, we show through simulations the effectiveness of the proposed solution for a case study.",

        "abstract": "Haptic devices allow a human user to physically interact with the virtual or simulated world by generating real forces to represent interactions in the virtual world. By definition, haptic devices exist in the set of robotic systems whose workspaces must overlap with the workspace of the human. For that reason, safety of the human becomes a central concern when developing both the physical hardware and the control systems for new and novel interfaces. Passive haptic devices, ones that display forces to the user by using passive actuators such as brakes, clutches of continuously variable transmissions, address the concerns of stability and safety by using actuators that physically guarantee a bounded output and the safety of the human user. However, a device using passive actuators can only produce a subset of the forces generated by a similar device built around active actuators. The work presented here will explore the use of a passive haptic device specifically with respect to teleoperation and will present a new algorithm for determining feedback that improves the transparency, a dynamic compensating controller. This controller will be implemented in LabVIEW on passive hardware and will be compared to two simpler control schemes in two typical teleoperation tasks, shape identification and point to point motion around an obstacle. The results will show that the passive device provides feedback that allows the user to recognize large surface features. Furthermore, results will show that the dynamic compensating controller proves especially useful in dynamic situations represented by the motion task.",

Due to the robot's geometry, leg motion, and water interactions, the net pitch moment at the center of mass is not zero making pitch motion unstable. This paper introduces two types of tails, passive and active, to stabilize pitch motion and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of each. It is shown in simulation that a purely passive tail can stabilize pitch motion and lead to a steady state robot pitch angle in the absence of disturbances. It is further shown that an active tail can compensate for disturbances and correct any drift in the robot body pitch angle due to changes in robot running speed.",

Coefficient parameters of the proposed model are determined optimally through well-coordinated experiments. Frequency response test is performed on an antagonistic structure consisting of Mckibben muscles manufactured in our laboratory and a pneumatic circuit with fast pneumatic control valves.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are the subject of an increasing interest in many applications and a key requirement for autonomous navigation is the attitude/position stabilization of the vehicle. Some previous works have suggested using catadioptric vision, instead of traditional perspective cameras, in order to gather much more information from the environment and therefore improve the robustness of the UAV attitude/position estimation. This paper belongs to a series of recent publications of our research group concerning catadioptric vision for UAVs. Currently, we focus on the extraction of skyline in catadioptric images since it provides important information about the attitude/position of the UAV. For example, the DEM-based methods can match the extracted skyline with a Digital Elevation Map (DEM) by process of registration, which permits to estimate the attitude and the position of the camera. Like any standard cameras, catadioptric systems cannot work in low luminosity situations because they are based on visible light. To overcome this important limitation, in this paper, we propose using a catadioptric infrared camera and extending one of our methods of skyline detection towards catadioptric infrared images. The task of extracting the best skyline in images is usually converted in an energy minimization problem that can be solved by dynamic programming. The major contribution of this paper is the extension of dynamic programming for catadioptric images using an adapted neighborhood and an appropriate scanning direction. Finally, we present some experimental results to demonstrate the validity of our approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a dynamic region following formation control method for a swarm of robots. In this control strategy, a swarm of robots shall move together as a group inside a dynamic region that can rotate or scale to enable the robots to adjust the formation. Various desired shapes can be formed by choosing appropriate functions. Unlike existing formation control methods, the proposed method do not need to have specific identities or orders in the group but yet dynamic formation can be formed for a large group of robots. This enables a swarm of robots to adjust the formation during the course of maneuver. The system is also scalable in the sense that any robot can move into the formation or leave the formation without affecting the other robots. Lyapunov-like function is presented for convergence analysis of the multi-robot systems. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed controller.",

In this paper we examine the relationship between leg stiffness and the speed and stability of dynamic legged locomotion. We utilize a torque-driven reduced-order model of running based on a successful family of running robots to show how optimal clock-driven controllers can interact with variably compliant limbs to adapt to changing operating conditions. We show that the leg stiffness adaptation gives, in general, better results than simply optimizing the gait controller and nearly as good as the co-optimization of controller and leg stiffness.",

At one extreme, the robot can achieve precise foothold selection on intermittent terrain. More surprisingly, the same inherently-stiff robot can also execute highly dynamic and underactuated motions with high repeatability. This range of dynamic motion is possible through careful reasoning about the coupled dynamics during underactuated phases of motion. Our results demonstrate visceral progress toward realization of one of the central theoretically claims giving legged locomotion a \u201cleg-up\u201d over wheeled robotics: that appropriate design of control can produce a set of capabilities which span a dynamic range from deliberate foothold selection through acrobatic-style motion on a single, particular robot.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic stability allows running animals to maintain preferred speed during locomotion over rough terrain. It appears that rapid disturbance rejection is an emergent property of the mechanical system. In running robots, simple motor control seems to be effective in the negotiation of rough terrain when used in concert with a mechanical system that stabilizes passively. In this paper, we show that a quadruped robot could be able to perform self-stable running behavior in significantly broader ranges of forward speed and pitch rate with suitable mechanical design. The results presented here are derived by studying the stability of passive dynamics of a quadruped robot running in the sagittal plane in a dimensionless context and can be summarized as: (a) the self-stabilized behavior of a quadruped robot for a particular gait is related to the magnitude of its dimensionless inertia, (b) the values of hip separation, normalized to rest leg length, and the leg relative stiffness of a quadruped robot affect the stability and should be in inverse proportion to its dimensionless inertia, and (c) the self-stable regime of quadruped running robots is enlarged at relatively high forward speeds.",

The control of this cable-driven exoskeleton is complicated because the cables can transmit forces to the arm only under tension. The standard PD controllers or computed torque controllers perform only moderately since the cables need to be in tension. Future efforts will seek to refine these control strategies and their implementations to improve functionality of a human user.",

The energy feedback strength is defined and the walking is modeled as a step-to-step function. The Jacobi matrix eigenvalues of the function are calculated together with the basin of attraction. From the analysis, we find the characteristic of Complementary Energy Feedback is being effective on a fast gait but weak on a slow one. By making use of the complementary energy feedback in walking experiment, our robot achieves speed change from 1.5 leg/s to 4.1 leg/s.",

This research describes the use of the FLS block transfer task to evaluate the performance of both surgeons and non-surgeons teleoperating under different time delay conditions on the University of Washington RAVEN Surgical Robot. Time delays of 0 ms, 250 ms, and 500 ms were used and a statistically significant difference in mean block transfer time as well as mean tool tip path length were shown. For this task no significant difference was shown between the surgeon and non-surgeon groups. Clearly surgeon input and feedback is key to surgical robotic system development, but this result implies that non-surgeon subjects can be tested for simple usability evaluations.",

The concept of hybrid zero dynamics is adapted to design walking gaits with three phases: underactuated heel roll, full actuation and underactuated toe roll. Ankle springs work in parallel with the ankle actuators. Stiffness and offset of the linear torsional springs at the ankle and gait parameters are optimized simultaneously. It is shown that simultaneous optimization of spring properties and gait is superior to optimizing the spring after the gait. Optimal spring stiffness and offset lead to a major reduction in energy consumption. Furthermore, a more human-like gait is observed for simultaneous optimization of gait and spring parameters compared to gait optimization with zero stiffness.",

        "abstract": "The model-based control of robotic manipulators relies on an exact model of the manipulator. Redundantly actuated PKM posses the ability to exhibit internal prestress that does not affect its environment. This allows for a purposeful distribution of control forces, taking into account secondary tasks, such optimal force distribution, active stiffness, and backlash avoiding control. In the presence of kinematic uncertainties this feature can become a serious problem since then the control forces may be annihilated or even some of the intentional prestress components may interfere with the environment. The effect of such kinematic uncertainties and the application of standard model-based control schemes is analyzed in this paper. It is shown that, in the presence of model uncertainties, it leads to parasitic perturbation forces that can not be compensated by the controls. An amended version of the augmented PD and computed torque control scheme is proposed that removes the parasitic feedback forces.",

        "abstract": "Direct haptic feedback and graphical force feedback have both been hypothesized to improve the performance of robot-assisted surgery. In this study we evaluate the benefits of haptic and graphical force feedback on surgeon performance and tissue exploration behavior during a teleoperated palpation task of artificial tissues. Seven surgeon subjects (four experienced in robot-assisted surgery) used a 7-degree-of-freedom teleoperated surgical robot to identify a comparatively rigid rigid target object (representing a calcified artery) in phantom heart models using the following feedback conditions: (1) direct haptic and graphical feedback, (2) direct haptic only, (3) graphical feedback only, and (4) no feedback. To avoid the problems of force sensing in a minimally invasive surgical environment, we use a position-exchange controller with dynamics compensation for direct haptic feedback and a force estimator displayed via tool-tip tracking bar graph for graphical force feedback. Although the transparency of the system is limited with this approach, results show that direct haptic force feedback minimizes applied forces to the tissue, while coupled haptic and graphical force feedback minimizes subject task error. For experienced surgeons, haptic force feedback substantially reduced task error independent of graphical feedback.",

        "abstract": "Cable-driven robots are currently extensively studied. Generally, for this type of manipulators, cables are considered to be massless and inextensible. But for large working volume applications, their mass cannot be neglected. Based on a well-known model which describes the profile of a cable under the action of its own weight, the inverse and forward kinematics of minimally constrained cable-driven manipulators can be numerically computed. This paper studies the effects of taking cable mass into account by comparison to classical massless cable model. It highlights the real effects of such a model on cable lengths to reach a given position. The effects on cable tensions are also studied.",

        "abstract": "When operating in partially-known environments, autonomous vehicles must constantly update their maps and plans based on new sensor information. Much focus has been placed on developing efficient incremental planning algorithms that are able to efficiently replan when the map and associated cost function changes. However, much less attention has been placed on efficiently updating the cost function used by these planners, which can represent a significant portion of the time spent replanning. In this paper, we present the limited incremental distance transform algorithm, which can be used to efficiently update the cost function used for planning when changes in the environment are observed. Using this algorithm it is possible to plan paths in a completely incremental way starting from a list of changed obstacle classifications. We present results comparing the algorithm to the Euclidean distance transform and a mask-based incremental distance transform algorithm. Computation time is reduced by an order of magnitude for a UAV application. We also provide example results from an autonomous micro aerial vehicle with on-board sensing and computing.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new on-line planner for dynamic environments that is based on the concept of velocity obstacles (VO). It addresses the issue of motion safety, i.e. avoiding states of inevitable collision, by selecting a proper time horizon for the velocity obstacle. The proper choice of the time horizon ensures that the boundary of the velocity obstacle coincides with the boundary of the set of inevitable collision states. This time horizon is determined by the minimum time it would take the robot to avoid collision, either by stopping or by passing the respective obstacle. The planner generates a near-time optimal trajectory to the goal by selecting at each time step the velocity that minimizes the time-to-go and is out of the velocity obstacle. The planner takes into account the shape, velocity, and path curvature of the obstacle's trajectory. It is demonstrated for on-line motion planning in very crowded static and dynamic environments.",

Such a system is well-suited to consumer-level robots, small form-factor robots, extraterrestrial rovers, and other platforms with limited computational resources. Our system also benefits high-end multiprocessor robots by leaving ample processor time on all camera-computer pairs to perform other critical visual tasks, such as obstacle detection.

To compensate for the weaknesses of the low-cost equipment, we put our efforts in obtaining a reliable model-based nonlinear controller. The GN&sC system was implemented on a small four rotor helicopter which has undergone an extensive program of flight tests, resulting in various flight behaviors under autonomous control from takeoff to landing.

With this goal in mind, we develop new methods, combining robotic path planning algorithms and molecular modeling techniques, for computing large-amplitude motions. This paper builds on these new methods, and introduces voxel maps as a computational tool to encode and to represent such motions. Voxel maps can be used to represent relative motions of two molecules, as well as conformational changes in macromolecules. We investigate several applications and show results that illustrate the interest of such representation. In particular, voxel maps are used to display channels into proteins, to analyze protein-ligand specificity, and to represents protein loop and domain motions.",

Furthermore the medical laser has become an integral part of dermatology, neurosurgery, ENT, esthetic, plastic and general surgery. Recent publications have shown, that the short pulsed CO2 laser is suitable to ablate bony and cartilage tissue and proposes fundamentally new operative techniques in medicine. The obtainable precision in cutting (in the hundred micrometers range) with a laser system can only be reached using means of computer and robot assisted surgery. We established the first robot assisted laser bone ablation setup, comprising a prototype CO2 laser system and a six degree of freedom robot. The laser beam is guided through a passive articulated mirror arm to the robots end-effector. The end-effector is composed of a two mirror galvanometric scan head, which deflects the pulsed laser beam onto the tissue. In this paper we present an end-effector calibration and registration method to determine the parameters which are critical in obtaining precise and accurate cutting results.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a methodology for treating energy consistency when considering multiple simultaneous impacts and contacts with friction in the simulation of systems of multiple interconnected bodies. Hard impact and contact is considered where deformation of the impacting surfaces is negligible. The proposed approach uses a discrete algebraic model of impact in conjunction with moment and tangential co-efficients of restitution (CORs) to develop a general impact law for determining post-impact velocities. This process depends on impulse-momentum theory, complementarity conditions, a principle of maximum dissipation, and the determination of contact forces. The proposed methodology also uses an energy-modifying COR to directly control the system's energy. The approach is illustrated on a bicycle-like structure.",

        "abstract": "Existing target tracking algorithms require the tracker to have access to information-rich sensors, and may have difficulty recovering when the target is out of the tracker's sensing range. In this paper, we present a target tracking algorithm that combines an extremely simple mobile robot with a networked collection of wireless sensor nodes, each of which is equipped with an unreliable, limited-range, Boolean sensor for detecting the target. The tracker maintains close proximity to the target using only information sensed by the network, and can effectively recover from temporarily losing track of the target. Our approach combines a protocol for the sensor network that conserves energy by dynamically adjusting the time-to-live for packets it transmits with a reactive strategy for the tracker based on its information state. We present an implementation along with experimental results. Our experimental results show that our system achieves both good tracking precision and low energy consumption.",

A metric derived from information theory, mutual information, is considered. Mutual information is widely used in multi-modal image registration (medical applications) since it is insensitive to changes in the lighting condition and to a wide class of non-linear image transformation. In this paper mutual-information is used as a new visual feature for visual servoing and allows us to build a new control law to control the 6 dof of the robot. Among various advantages, this approach does not require any matching nor tracking step, is robust to large illumination variation and allows to consider, within the same task, different image modalities. Experiments that demonstrate these advantages conclude the paper.",

Thereby, a high-performance active multi-focal camera system imitates visual behaviors such as scan, saccade and fixation. Bottom-up attention uses wide-angle stereo data to select a sequence of fixation points in the peripheral field of view. Successive saccade and fixation of high foveal resolution using a telephoto camera enables high accurate object recognition. Once an object is recognized as target object, the bottom-up attention model is adapted to the current environment, using the top-down information extracted from this target object. The bottom-up attention model and the object recognition algorithm based on SIFT are implemented using CUDA technology on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which highly accelerates image processing. In the experimental evaluation, all the target objects were detected in different backgrounds. Evident improvements in accuracy, flexibility and efficiency are achieved.",

We outline possible applications of the corresponding models in the context of robot control, discussing suitable representation formalisms, inference and learning methods as well as transparent extensions of a robot planning language that allow robot control programs to soundly integrate the results of probabilistic inference into their plan generation process.",

In mobile multi-agent systems, this principle directly leads to equitable partitioning policies in which (i) the workspace is divided into subregions of equal measure, (ii) there is a bijective correspondence between agents and subregions, and (iii) each agent is responsible for service requests originating within its own subregion. In this paper, we provide the first distributed algorithm that provably allows m agents to converge to an equitable partition of the workspace, from any initial configuration, i.e., globally. Our approach is related to the classic Lloyd algorithm, and provides novel insights into the properties of power diagrams. Simulation results are presented and discussed.",

        "abstract": "Estimating the camera pose in stereo vision systems is an important issue in computer vision and robotics. One popular way to handle this problem consists of determining the essential matrix which minimizes the algebraic error obtained from image point correspondences. Unfortunately, this search amounts to solving a nonconvex optimization, and the existing methods either rely on some approximations in order to get rid of the non-convexity or provide a solution that may be affected by the presence of local minima. This paper proposes a new approach to address this search without presenting such problems. In particular, we show that the sought essential matrix can be obtained by solving a convex optimization built through a suitable reformulation of the considered minimization via appropriate techniques for representing polynomials. Numerical results show the proposed approach compares favorably with some standard methods in both cases of synthetic data and real data.",

Previously, researchers reported that muscle fatigue can be estimated using a low-frequency band of an SEMG signal. However, these studies were performed exclusively during static contraction tasks. The objective of the present study was to evaluate and determine the frequency range for a low-frequency band. In addition, the performance during dynamic contraction tasks was analyzed. A group of healthy university students (8 males) was recruited, and endurance handgrip tasks were conducted. SEMG signals were captured from the forearm muscle. The frequency range for the low-frequency band was redefined as 5 - 40 Hz. The results from a dynamic contraction task indicated that a low-frequency band is a reliable method for indexing muscle fatigue from SEMG signals.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on the hand posture when a human subject pinches an object, and the correlation between the results of sensory evaluation by the subject and the tendon force of the subject's fingers are investigated. Surface electromyogram (surface EMG) and pinching force are measured during the pinching motion of human subjects. Experimental results show that subjects feel comfortable pinching a 60 [mm] cylinder. The surface EMGs are lower in the vicinity of 60 [mm]. Furthermore, a tendon-driven robot hand is developed as a sensing hand prototype. The surface EMGs and the motor torque are compared in a pinching experiment using the tendon-driven robot hand. Experimental results show that the tendon-driven robot hand is effective for quantitatively evaluating pinching effort. Simulation of the pinching motion is conducted using a simple finger model. The simulation results show the importance of finger posture and the moment arm in estimating tendon force. Taken together, these results demonstrate the possibility of conducting quantitative evaluation using the tendon-driven robot hand.",

        "abstract": "Registering multiple sets of 3D range data is a crucial capability for robots. The standard method for matching two sets of range data is to convert the ranges to a point cloud representation, and then use on of the many variants of iterative closest point (ICP). We present a set of alternative methods for matching 3D range scans based on a different data representation: evidence grid maps. Evidence grids are robust to noise and variations in point density, can incorporate an indefinite number of ranges, and explicitly encode empty as well as occupied space. While 3D evidence grids can be huge when naively implemented, we use an optimized octree data structure to efficiently store sparse volumetric maps. To register a series of range scans, we build an evidence grid map for each scan, and then register them together using a several different methods. The first two methods are based on a 3D extension of the classic 2D Lucas-Kanade template matching method, and differ only in whether we match a single large region, or multiple small regions that are selected heuristically. Our third method involves extracting surfaces from the evidence grids, and then running ICP to register the surfaces. We demonstrate our methods and compare them to ICP using two datasets collected by two different subterranean robots.",

        "abstract": "Collision detection and estimation from a monocular visual sensor is an important enabling technology for safe navigation of small or micro air vehicles in near earth flight. In this paper, we introduce a new approach called expansion segmentation, which simultaneously detects \u201ccollision danger regions\u201d of significant positive divergence in inertial aided video, and estimates maximum likelihood time to collision (TTC) in a correspondenceless framework within the danger regions. This approach was motivated from a literature review which showed that existing approaches make strong assumptions about scene structure or camera motion, or pose collision detection without determining obstacle boundaries, both of which limit the operational envelope of a deployable system. Expansion segmentation is based on a new formulation of 6-DOF inertial aided TTC estimation, and a new derivation of a first order TTC uncertainty model due to subpixel quantization error and epipolar geometry uncertainty. Proof of concept results are shown in a custom designed urban flight simulator and on operational flight data from a small air vehicle.",

We present a 15-node system prototype and results from an experiment of 300 trials that measures system performance on a benchmark task. The benchmark we chose is the connectivity problem - how to maintain connectivity in the module graph during the disconnections and reconnections that occur during reconfiguration. We also provide full implementation details in pseudocode for our connectivity algorithm. Our results show that, despite its inherent scalability limitations, a ZigBee wireless system is feasible as a simple, low-cost communication system for self-reconfiguring modular robots.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Recent humanoid control investigations have emphasized the importance of controlling whole-body angular momentum throughout a movement task. For typical movement tasks, such as normal walking, such controllers minimize fluctuations in angular momentum about the center of mass (CM). This minimization is consistent with observed behavior of humans for such tasks. However, there are cases where such minimization is not desirable. In this study, we investigate movement tasks where bipedal balance control requires a relaxation of the goal of minimizing whole-body angular moment. We construct a humanoid model having a human-like mass distribution, and a Moment-Exploiting Control algorithm that modulates whole-body angular momentum to enhance CM control. The model only requires reference trajectories for CM position and torso orientation. Joint reference trajectories are not required. While balancing on one leg, we show that the controller is capable of correcting errors in CM state by sacrificing angular postural goals for the swing leg, trunk and head. This prioritization capability provides robustness to significant disturbances, without the need to plan new reference trajectories. We compare the dynamic behavior of our humanoid model to that of human test participants. While standing on one leg, the model, like the human, is shown to reposition its CM just above the stance foot from an initial body state where CM velocity is zero, and the ground CM projection falls outside the foot envelope.",

The proposed scheme does not require the velocity feedback because velocity measurements may not be available due to cost and weight. We introduce parameters involving the tracking and estimation errors and their derivatives into the observer-controller. Exploiting the structural properties, we propose the new combined form of observer-controller to ensure the closed loop stability of the tracking and estimation. Moreover, we show that the proposed controller-observer scheme achieves semi-globally exponential stability results for tracking errors and estimation errors. The proposed observer-controller facilitates the stability analysis and explicitly extends Nicosia-Tomei observer-based tracking control. To validate the proposed scheme, we conduct numerical simulation of a two-link robot. The simulation results clearly indicate that the proposed scheme improves the error convergence for both trajectory tracking and velocity estimation.",

This paper further extends this approach, (i) by explicitly supporting the inclusion of inequality constraints in the task and (ii) by supporting a broader class of objective functions for translating the task constraints into robot motion. These extensions are made while retaining a tractable mathematical problem structure (a convex program). Furthermore, first results on extending the approach to non-instantaneous tasks are presented. As illustrated in the paper, the power of the approach lies (i) at its versatility to specify a wide range of robot behaviors and the ease of making task adjustments, and (ii) at its generic nature, that permits using systematic procedures to derive the underlying control equations.",

        "abstract": "We document the progress in the design and implementation of a motion control strategy that exploits visual feedback from a narrow baseline stereo head mounted in the hand of a wheelchair mounted robot arm (WMRA) to recognize and grasp textured ADL objects for which one or more templates exist in a large image database. The problem is made challenging by kinematic uncertainty in the robot, imperfect camera and stereo calibration, as well as the fact that we work in unstructured environments. The approach relies on separating the overall motion into gross and fine motion components. During the gross motion phase, local structure on an object around a user selected point of interest (POI) is extracted using sparse stereo information which is then utilized to converge on and roughly align the object with the image plane in order to be able to pursue object recognition and fine motion with strong likelihood of success. Fine motion is utilized to grasp the target object by relying on feature correspondences between the live object view and its template image. While features are detected using a robust real-time keypoint tracker, a hybrid visual servoing technique is exploited in which tracked pixel space features are utilized to generate translational motion commands while a Euclidean homography decomposition scheme is utilized for generation of orientation setpoints for the robot gripper. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Most present adaptive control strategies for visual servoing of robots have assumed that the unknown camera parameters, kinematics and dynamics of visual servoing system should be linearly parameterized in the regressor matrix form. This is because the limitation of the traditional adaptive design in which the uncertainties should be time-invariant such that all time varying terms in the visual servoing system are collected inside the regressor matrix. However, derivation of the regressor matrix is tedious. In this paper, a FAT (function approximation technique) based adaptive controller is designed for visual servo robots without the need for the regressor matrix. A Lyapunov-like analysis is used to justify the closed-loop stability and boundedness of internal signals. Moreover, the upper bounds of tracking errors in the transient state are also derived. Computer simulation results are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed scheme.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Large and fragile systems may require motion trajectories with the highest attainable degree of smoothness. This paper introduces a method to create infinitely continuous motion profiles based on convolving an infinitely continuous FIR kernel with an underlying rate-limited position profile. Conventional motion profiling is limited to blending polynomial between linear segments. Due to the issues of controlling unwanted inflections and the computing of the polynomial coefficient, blending polynomials are usually limited to third order with special cases up to seventh order. Beyond third order, closed form equations do not exists for the coefficients, requiring a set of equations to be solved for each blend. With third order polynomials the highest derivative that can be controlled is jerk. While maximum jerk can be controlled, change in jerk is instantaneous. This inherent instantaneous change in jerk can send shock waves though a system with the possibility of causing damage. The infinitely continuous profiles introduced in this paper overcomes all the shortcomings of polynomial blending. With FIR smoothing of an underlying rate-limited position profile, only a single kernel is needed to be computed off-line before motion starts. The entire process of motion generation consists of rate-limiting desired position updates and then filtering them with an infinitely continuous FIR kernel. The output is an infinitely continuous profile that allows real-time updates of velocity. Two methods are introduced to create the kernels. In the first method the duration of the kernel is minimized for a given maximum value of any derivative. In the second method the maximum value of any derivative is minimized for a given kernel duration. The use of the convolution instead of polynomial fitting to create profiles is simpler, eliminates special cases, and allows real-time updates of velocity while producing maximally smooth profiles.",

        "abstract": "As cancer becomes the No.1 cause of the death in Japan, endoscopic surgery is gaining attentions. In this paper, endoscopical tool to grip and lift the targeted tumor in ESD (endoscopic submucosal dissection) surgery is proposed. This articulated microarm is part of new ESD surgery concept in which two wire-driven microarms (1 times 1 times 25 mm) from the tip of the endoscope help lift the tumor to cut. This research needs to emphasize a new fabrication method of arm which is fabricated by photolithography and electroplating. The microarm is composed of five layers. Individual layers are fabricated separately and assembled together in the end. The microarm uses the elastic deformation of metal to bend (Cu or Phosphor Bronze). It is feedback control with PID using a strain gauge attached to the articulated joint. This technique enabled the further miniaturization of the microarm, but it also comes with a downside. It is difficult to build a 3-dimensional structure. We overcame this problem by proposing an assembly method (STAMP: stacked microassembly process). Electroplated layers are assembled by stacking up on top of each other. This assembly process is feasible to produce multiple microarms at one assembly, thus mass-production with low cost is possible. A strain gauge is attached to the elastic joint as an angle sensor.",

Strict convexity ensures at least C1 property of the distance function -and hence, its gradient continuity. STP-BV were introduced in our previous work [1], but proximity distance queries were limited to pairs of STP-BV covered objects. In this work we present an alternative to achieve fast proximity distance queries between a STP-BV object and any other convex shape. This is simply made by proposing a support mapping for STP-BV to be used with GJK algorithm [2] and its EPA extension to penetration cases [3]. Implementation and experiments of the proposed method and its performance are demonstrated with potential applications to robotics and computer graphics.",

In this paper, we modify their mathematical expressions and perform a rigorous analysis on their robustness and complexity for the problem of 3D registration for overlapping point cloud views. More concretely, we present several optimizations that reduce their computation times drastically by either caching previously computed values or by revising their theoretical formulations. The latter results in a new type of local features, called Fast Point Feature Histograms (FPFH), which retain most of the discriminative power of the PFH. Moreover, we propose an algorithm for the online computation of FPFH features for realtime applications. To validate our results we demonstrate their efficiency for 3D registration and propose a new sample consensus based method for bringing two datasets into the convergence basin of a local non-linear optimizer: SAC-IA (SAmple Consensus Initial Alignment).",

        "abstract": "During needle-based procedures, transitions between tissue layers often involve puncture events that produce substantial deformation and tend to drive the needle off course. In this paper, we analyze the mechanics of these rupture events corresponding to unstable crack propagation during the insertion of a sharp needle in an inhomogeneous tissue. The force-deflection curve of the needle prior to a rupture event is modeled by a nonlinear viscoelastic Kelvin model and a stress analysis is used to predict the relationship between rupture force and needle velocity. The model predicts that the force-deflection response of the needle is steeper and the tissue absorbs less energy when the needle moves faster. The force of rupture also decreases for faster insertion under certain conditions. The observed properties are sufficient to show that maximizing needle velocity minimizes tissue deformation and damage, and consequently, results in less needle insertion position error. The model predicts that tissue deformation and absorbed energy asymptotically approach lower bounds as velocity increases. Experiments with porcine cardiac tissue confirm the analytical predictions.",

Two important technologies are described: a motion generation and a balance control. The motion generation is a unified way to design both walking and running and can generate the trajectory with the vertical conditions of the Center Of Mass (COM) in short calculation time. The balance control enables a robot to maintain balance by changing the positions of the contact foot dynamically when the robot is disturbed. This control consists of 1) compliance control without force sensors, in which the joints are made compliant by feed-forward torques and adjustment of gains of position control, and 2) feedback control, which uses the measured orientation of the robot's torso used in the motion generation as an initial condition to decide the foot positions. Finally, a human-sized humanoid robot that can run forward at 7.0 [km/h] is presented.",

This also permits to construct regional maps, that is, it makes possible efficient and accurate intermediate mapping levels between local maps and the whole global map. We have extended our algorithm to the multi-robot case. We have tested our methodology using the Victoria Park data set with satisfactory results.",

        "abstract": "Using autonomous mobile robots to patrol environments for detecting intruders is a topic of increasing relevance for its possible applications. A large part of strategies for mobile patrolling robots proposed so far adopt some kind of random movements. Although these strategies are unpredictable for an intruder, they are not always efficient in getting the patroller a large expected utility. In this paper we propose an approach that considers a model of the adversary in a game theoretic framework to find optimally-efficient patrolling strategies. We show that our approach extends those proposed in literature and we experimentally analyze some of its features.",

In our approach, the center of mass (CoM) of positions and velocities of all mobile sensors in the network (Single-CoM) or the center of mass of position and velocity of each sensor and its neighbors (Multi-CoM) is controlled to track and observe a moving target. In addition, we prove that the CoM of position and velocity exponentially converges to the moving target in free space. Based on this approach, the target is kept at the center of the sensor network. This is of great advantage for sensors to track and observe the target for recognition or identification purposes. In addition, collision-free and velocity matching among mobile sensors are guaranteed in the whole process of the target tracking. We also investigate the stability of our algorithms. The numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the proposed approach.",

The motion of distant features determines the rotational component that we recover with a robust two-point algorithm. Once the rotation is known, we recover the translational component from close features using a robust one-point algorithm. The overall algorithm is faster than estimating the motion in one step by a standard RANSAC-based three-point algorithm. And in contrast to other visual odometry work, we avoid the problem of nearly degenerate data, under which RANSAC is known to return inconsistent results. We confirm our claims on data from an outdoor robot equipped with a stereo rig.",

Animal cells that have been chemically softened by cytochalasin and stained with Hoechst dye are aspirated into a thin microchannel of a microfluidic chip and stretched thin, allowing the nucleus of the expanded oocyte to be monitored. Half the volume of the oocyte is aspirated into the thin microchannel and a high-velocity fluid flow is generated in the wide microchannel to bisect the oocyte. Then, the half-oocytes are monitored to determine which contains the nucleus. To control flow velocity with high accuracy and rapid response, we also developed a syringe pump that is small, has no backlash, and has highly-accurate volume control and a good response for automatic cutting. In this report, we describe the monitoring method and construction of the syringe pump.",

In this method, an optimization-based control algorithm, called Iterative Feedback Tuning (IFT), is used to employ safety requirements as constraints of an optimization problem, which is then solved using sequential quadratic programming (SQP). Therefore, this control method is applicable for safety-critical systems such as personal service robots. These robots are developed to provide assistance to patients or disabled people in their daily life by performing human-robot contact tasks such as wiping the face with a towel, scratching, etc. In addition, in IFT, a Newton search direction to update the controller parameters at each iteration is obtained on the basis of the closed-loop experimental data. Hence, IFT does not require explicit modeling of environment, in particular, human dynamics, otherwise in model-based approach it will be hard task to obtain a useful model. In the simulation and experiment, the effectiveness of the proposed method is examined by applying it to 1-DOF contact system.",

Relative to previous works, the presented method avoids the reliance on the force dynamics on the characteristics of the micro-objects. Furthermore, the estimation is a closed-loop kind technique so that convergency can be ensured efficiently. To perform these, we consider the force at the tip of a piezocantilever as an unknown input and we use an unknown input observation technique. We especially use the inverse-dynamics-based UIO technique because it is well suited for a piezo-cantilever model. The experiments show that the performances of the observer are convenient for micromanipulation/microassembly tasks.",

When the robot first encounters an unknown object, found to be within a certain (small) distance from its eyes, it stores a cluster of the features present within an interval about that distance, using depth perception. Whenever a previously stored object crosses the robot's field of view again, it is recognized, mapped into an egocentrical frame of reference, and gazed at. This mapping is persistent, in the sense that its identification and position are kept even if not visible by the robot. Features are stored and recognized in a bottom-up way. Experimental results on the humanoid robot iCub validate this approach. This work creates the foundation for a way of linking the bottom-up attention system with top-down, object-oriented information provided by humans.",

        "abstract": "We present GATMO (Generalized Approach to Tracking Movable Objects), a system for localization and mapping that incorporates the dynamic nature of the environment while maintaining semantic labels. Objects in the environment are broken down into multiple mobility levels, from static (walls) to highly mobile (people), by maintaining a history of object movement. Object classification is accomplished through a multi-layer, multi-hypothesis approach that does not rely on any static features such as shape or size. Maps are stored in an efficient manner that incorporates a history of previous orientations of each object. GATMO is initialized with a static map; it subsequently changes the map over time as objects in the map change position.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of large scale terrain modeling for a mobile robot. Building a model of large scale terrain data that can adequately handle uncertainty and incompleteness in a statistically sound way is a very challenging problem. This work proposes the use of Gaussian processes as models of large scale terrain. The proposed model naturally provides a multi-resolution representation of space, incorporates and handles uncertainties aptly and copes with incompleteness of sensory information. Gaussian process regression techniques are applied to estimate and interpolate (to fill gaps in unknown areas) elevation information across the field. The estimates obtained are the best linear unbiased estimates for the data under consideration. A single non-stationary (neural network) Gaussian process is shown to be powerful enough to model large and complex terrain, handling issues relating to discontinuous data effectively. A local approximation methodology based on KD-trees is also proposed in order to ensure local smoothness and yet preserve the characteristic features of rich and complex terrain data. The use of the local approximation technique based on KD-trees further addresses concerns relating to the scalability of the proposed approach for large data sets. Experiments performed on sparse GPS based survey data as well as dense laser scanner data taken at different mine-sites are reported in support of these claims.",

After the robot is tossed through small spaces, it moves around the rugged or bumpy wall and ceiling to overlook the floor by the installed camera. To generate large enough adhesive force even on the rugged wall, a gel mat made of urethane is introduced, whose force can be recovered by the washing function. Developed sticky robot based on the above method could realize the 3D mobile performance on the rugged wall and ceiling with the function of washing of the gel mat and monitoring the scene of the inside of the building.

        "abstract": "In this paper we present an overview of techniques and approaches used for a load transportation system based on small size unmanned helicopters. The focus is on the control approach and on the movement of the rope connecting helicopters and load. The proposed approach is based on two control loops: an outer loop to control the translation of each helicopter in compound and an inner loop to control the orientation of helicopters. The challenge here is that in both loops the dynamics of the whole system - all helicopters and load - should be accounted for. It is shown, that for designing the outer loop controller a complex model of the helicopters and load can be replaced by a simplified model based on interconnected mass points. For designing the inner loop controller, the complete dynamics of the whole system are considered. The usage of force sensors in the ropes is proposed in order to simplify the inner loop controller and to make it robust against variations of system parameters. The presented inner loop controller is independent of the number of coupled helicopters. The outer loop controller depends on the number of helicopters. The problem of oscillations in the flexible ropes due to external disturbancies (e.g. wind gusts) is discussed and a solution based on load state observer is presented. The performance of the presented system was verified in simulations and in real flight experiments with one and three helicopters transporting the load. The worldwide first demonstration of a slung load transportation using three helicopters was performed in December 2007.",

        "abstract": "Mobile vision services have recently been proposed for the support of urban nomadic users. While camera phones with image based recognition of urban objects provide intuitive interfaces for the exploration of urban space and mobile work, similar methodology can be applied to vision in mobile robots and autonomous aerial vehicles. A major issue for the performance of the service - involving indexing into a huge amount of reference images - is ambiguity in the visual information. We propose to exploit geo-information in association with visual features to restrict the search within a local context. In a mobile image retrieval task of urban object recognition, we determine object hypotheses from (i) mobile image based appearance and (ii) GPS based positioning, and investigate the performance of Bayesian information fusion with respect to benchmark geo-referenced image databases (TSG-20, TSG-40). This work specifically proposes to introduce position information as geo-contextual priors for geo-attention based object recognition to better prime the vision task. The results from geo-referenced image capture in an urban scenario prove a significant increase in recognition accuracy (> 10%) when using the geo-contextual information in contrast to omitting geo-information, the application of geo-attention is capable to improve accuracy by further > 5%.",

        "abstract": "We incorporate sampling-based global path planning with Visual Servoing (VS) for a robotic arm equipped with an in-hand camera. The path planning accounts for a number of constraints: 1) maintaining continuous visibility of the target within the camera's field of view, 2) avoiding visual occlusion of target features caused by the workspace obstacles, robot's body, or the target itself, 3) avoiding collision with physical obstacles or self collision, and 4) joint limits. Incorporating these constraints enhances the applicability of VS to significantly more complex environments/tasks, thereby making the resulting VS much more robust. The proposed planner explores the camera space, i.e. 3D Cartesian space, for permissible camera paths satisfying the aforementioned constraints by iteratively extending a search tree in camera space and simultaneously tracking these paths in the robot's joint space using a local planner. The planned camera path is then projected into the image space and tracked using an image-based visual servoing scheme. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach in accomplishing VS tasks in complex environments are demonstrated through a number of simulations on a 6-dof robot arm moving among obstacles.",

In particular, it is shown that transparency can be preserved even though one, and even two, communication channels are set to zero.

We show that the integral curve over the computed vector field is guaranteed to converge to the goal configuration, be collision-free, and maintain Cinfin smoothness. As compared to prior approaches, our algorithm works well on non-convex robots and obstacles.We demonstrate its performance on planar robots with 2 or 3 DOFs, articulated robots composed of 3 serial links and multi-robot systems with 6 DOFs.",

This task is challenging due to the intensive memory requirements to represent the map, uncertainties in the location estimate of the robot and unknown terrain type and obstacles on the way to the goal. We develop a novel graph-based path planner that is based on only local perceptual information to plan a path in such environments. In order to extend the capabilities of the graph representation, we introduce Exploration Bias, which is a node attribute that can implicitly encode obstacle features at immediate surrounding of a node in the graph, the uncertainty of the planner about a node location and also the frequency of visiting a location. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting path cost and distance that the robot traverses to reach the goal location is not significantly different from those of the previous approaches.",

        "abstract": "Shape is one of the useful information for object detection. The human visual system can often recognize objects based on the 2-D outline shape alone. In this paper, we address the challenging problem of shape matching in the presence of complex background clutter and occlusion. To this end, we propose a graph-based approach for shape matching. Unlike prior methods which measure the shape similarity without considering the relation among edge pixels, our approach uses the connectivity of edge pixels by generating a graph. A group of connected edge pixels, which is represented by an \u201cedge\u201d of the graph, is considered together and their similarity cost is defined for the \u201cedge\u201d weight by explicit comparison with the corresponding template part. This approach provides the key advantage of reducing ambiguity even in the presence of background clutter and occlusion. The optimization is performed by means of a graph-based dynamic algorithm. The robustness of our method is demonstrated for several examples including long video sequences. Finally, we applied our algorithm to our grasping robot system by providing the object information in the form of prompt hand-drawn templates.",

To control these multiple, potentially competing objectives, we present a phased controller that operates one manipulator at a time using closed-loop imaging feedback. We present an automated procedure planning technique that uses tissue geometry to select the needle insertion location, manipulation locations, and controller parameters. The planner uses a stochastic optimization of a cost function that includes tissue stress and robustness to disturbances. We demonstrate the system on 2D tissues simulated with a mass-spring model, including a simulation of a prostate brachytherapy procedure. It can reduce targeting errors from more than 2 cm to less than 1 mm, and can also shift obstacles by over 1 cm to clear them away from the needle path.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new two-way visual servoing method, named as hand & eye-vergence visual servoing. This idea stems from animal's evolution history, predator have evolved their eye positions to be at the front face and their eyes turn to gaze at the target prey to be suited to triangulation, enhancing the ability to measure precisely the distance to the prey for catching it. This animal's visual tracking includes motion control by visual servoing and triangular eye vergence. Our proposed method includes two loops: an outer loop for conventional visual servoing that direct a manipulator toward a target object and an inner loop for active motion of binocular camera for accurate and broad observation of the target object. The effectiveness of the hand & eye-vergence visual servoing is evaluated through simulations incorporated with actual dynamics of 7-DoF robot on the view points of how the new idea improved the stability in visual servoing dynamics and the accuracy of hand pose.",

We use a blotting procedure to attach flagellated bacteria to a buoyancy-neutral plate called a microbarge. The motion of the plate depends on the distribution of the cells on the plate and the stimuli from the environment. We construct a stochastic mathematical model for the system, based on the assumption that the behavior of each bacterium is random and independent of that of its neighbors. The main finding of the paper is that the motion of the barge plus bacteria system is a function of a very small set of parameters. This reduced-dimensional model can be easily estimated using experimental data. We show that the simulation results obtained from the model show an excellent match with the experimentally-observed motion of the barge.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a lightweight 328 g anthropomorphic robot hand that can exert a large grasp force. We propose a combination mechanism of a flexion-drive and a force-magnification-drive for a cable driven multifingered robot hand. The flexion-drive consisting of a feed screw enables quick motion of its fingers and the force-magnification-drive consisting of an eccentric cam, a bearing and a pulley enables a firm grasp. This paper also proposes a three-dimensional linkage for the thumb. This linkage consists of four links and is driven by a feed screw. It can oppose to a large force exerted by the other fingers with the force-magnification-drive. These mechanisms are compact enough to be installed in the developed lightweight hand. We experimentally verify that the maximum fingertip force of the hand exceeds 20 N and that the thumb can hold a large force of 100 N. The time to fully close the hand by using the flexion-drives is 0.47 s. After the fingers make contact with an object, the time to achieve a firm grasp by using the grasp-magnification-drive is approximately 1 s.",

The position tracking system works similar to an optical encoder using a specially structured pattern as scale. Thus, with low computational overhead, an accuracy below 10 nm is achieved in a tungsten cathode-based microscope. The tracking system is virtually immune to changes in contrast, brightness, magnification and, to a certain extend, to defocusing. With a customized, external scan generator and scanning algorithm, the bottleneck of image acquisition can be bypassed and the position tracking system can reach update rates of more than 1 kHz. Furthermore, measurements can be conducted over long working ranges of up to 200 mum without losing precision.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an EEG-based human brain-actuated robotic system, which allows performing navigation and visual exploration tasks between remote places via Internet, using only brain activity. In operation, two teleoperation modes can be combined: robot navigation and camera exploration. In both modes, the user faces a real-time video captured by the robot camera merged with augmented reality items. In this representation, the user concentrates on a target area to navigate to or visually explore; then, a visual stimulation process elicits the neurological phenomenon that enables the brain-computer system to decode the intentions of the user. In the navigation mode, the target destination is transferred to the autonomous navigation system, which drives the robot to the desired place while avoiding collisions with the obstacles detected by the laser scanner. In the camera mode, the camera is aligned with the target area to perform an active visual exploration of the remote scenario. In June 2008, within the framework of the experimental methodology, five healthy subjects performed pre-established navigation and visual exploration tasks for one week between two cities separated by 260 km. On the basis of the results, a technical evaluation of the device and its main functionalities is reported. The overall result is that all the subjects were able to successfully solve all the tasks reporting no failures, showing a high robustness of the system.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a human daily activity recognition method by fusing the data from two wearable inertial sensors attached on one foot and the waist of the subject, respectively. We developed a multi-sensor fusion scheme for activity recognition. First, data from these two sensors are fused for coarse-grained classification in order to determine the type of the activity: zero displacement activity, transitional activity, and strong displacement activity. Second, a fine-grained classification module based on heuristic discrimination or hidden Markov models (HMMs) is applied to further distinguish the activities. We conducted experiments using a prototype wearable sensor system and the obtained results prove the effectiveness and accuracy of our algorithm.",

Furthermore, we want to increase the robot's autonomous, vision-guided walking capabilities. The robot has 25 degrees of freedom, including 7-DoF legs with actively driven toe joints. It is characterized by its lightweight construction, a modular, multi-sensory joint design with brushless motors and an electronics architecture using decentralized joint controllers. Special emphasis was put on an improved mass distribution of the leg apparatus to achieve good dynamic performance. The sensor system comprises absolute angular sensors in all links, two custom-made force/torque sensors in the feet and a high-precision inertial sensor in the upper body. Trajectory generation and control system aim at faster, more flexible, and more robust walking patterns.",

        "abstract": "The minimization of task completion time of robot arms has been an extensively studied area in robotics. Previous researches mostly focused on optimization methods for the motion planning and collision avoidance, which did not involve any modifications in the hardware design of a robot arm. Some researches, on the other hand, fully design a specialized robot arm for a given task. In this study, we propose a hybrid design composed of a hardware design and an optimization method. The hardware design is a tool attachment, which is a fixed linkage attached between the end-effector of a robot arm and a tool. In the optimization method, we incorporate base placement design, goal rearrangement and collision avoidance through motion coordination in order to minimize the task completion time of a robot arm. Our proposed design is tested using a 6-DOF robot arm and a 1-DOF rotating table. The method is evaluated over a single task and a set of tasks showing its effectiveness and applicability for practical applications.",

        "abstract": "In current AFM-based nanomanipulation systems, the commercial position closed-loop controller for piezoelectric nanopositioning stages are implemented with success in a wide range of industrial applications. Even if these controllers operate with satisfactory nominal tracking performance, considerable attention has been focused on appropriate control strategies to compensate hysteresis, nonlinearities, drift and creep for high bandwidths and large scanning regimes. As these closed-loop controllers are very cost-effective, a special interest in robust plug-in compensators seems to be a solution. We proposed in this paper a robust plug-in compensator using the H-infinity loop-shaping techniques which can be plugged into the existing controller without affecting the already satisfactory nominal tracking performance of the existing closed-loop system. Dynamic modeling, identification and robust control of a 3 d.o.f. piezoelectric nanorobotic positioner are presented in this paper in order to improve the nanorobot performance under plant parameter variations and in the presence of external disturbances. Simulation and experimental results are given to validate the proposed plug-in robust compensator in the case of a nanorobotic manipulation task.",

The robot is unable to access precise information regarding position coordinates, angular coordinates, time, or odometry, but is nevertheless able to navigate itself to a goal among unknown piecewise-analytic obstacles in the plane. The only sensor providing real values is an intensity sensor, which measures the signal strength emanating from the goal. The signal intensity function may or may not be symmetric; the main requirement is that the level sets are concentric images of simple closed curves, i.e. topological circles. Convergence analysis and distance bounds are established for the presented approach.",

Each of the spokes can be individually actuated with intelligent motion planning to walk over uneven terrain with high mobility. This form of novel locomotion has the potential to combine the efficiency of a wheeled robot and the mobility of a legged robot. A highly mobile robot such as IMPASS could prove very valuable in applications where the terrain is complex and dangerous, such as search and rescue, reconnaissance, or anti-terror response. This video presents an overview of the system concept with examples and demonstrations of its unique mobility. Beginning with an overview of the system concept and hardware, the video then demonstrates the different mobility advantages. These include rough terrain locomotion, dynamic surface locomotion, and large step climbing.",

This model is sampled while the robot is tracking ldquoexcitingrdquo trajectories, in order to get an over determined linear system. The linear least squares solution of this system calculates the estimated parameters. The efficiency of this method has been proved through the experimental identification of a lot of prototypes and industrial robots. However, this method needs joint torque and position measurements and the estimation of the joint velocities and accelerations through the pass band filtering of the joint position at high sample rate. So, the observation matrix is noisy. Moreover identification process takes place when the robot is controlled by feedback. These violations of assumption imply that the LS solution is biased. The Simple Refined Instrumental Variable (SRIV) approach deals with this problem of noisy observation matrix and can be statistically optimal. This paper focuses on this technique which will be applied to a 2 degrees of freedom (DOF) prototype developed by the IRCCyN Robotic team.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an approach that allows a robot to observe, generalize, and reproduce tasks observed from multiple demonstrations. Motion capture data is recorded in which a human instructor manipulates a set of objects. In our approach, we learn relations between body parts of the demonstrator and objects in the scene. These relations result in a generalized task description. The problem of learning and reproducing human actions is formulated using a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). The posteriors corresponding to the nodes of the DBN are estimated by observing objects in the scene and body parts of the demonstrator. To reproduce a task, we seek for the maximum-likelihood action sequence according to the DBN. We additionally show how further constraints can be incorporated online, for example, to robustly deal with unforeseen obstacles. Experiments carried out with a real 6-DoF robotic manipulator as well as in simulation show that our approach enables a robot to reproduce a task carried out by a human demonstrator. Our approach yields a high degree of generalization illustrated by performing a pick-and-place and a whiteboard cleaning task.",

First, to reduce joint inertia, a double-input-single-output mechanism with one internal degree of freedom (DOF) is presented as part of the basic structure of the RDJ-DA. Next, the basic structure of RDJ-DA is further explained and its dynamics and statics are derived. Then, the impedance control scheme of RDJ-DA to produce compliant motions is proposed and the validity of the proposed controller is investigated using numerical examples.",

By analyzing the shadow, the robot can easily identify these landmarks, detect the direction of the passage, and adaptively traverse through while continuously updating the map. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by real experiments using the in-pipe robot MRINSPECT V for inspecting inside of the miniature urban 8-inch gas pipeline structure.",

Recent work in collision detection using insect inspired optical flow based methods have been demonstrated in low power hardware implementations [1][2][3][4], but have not achieved the obstacle detection and false alarm rate performance necessary for practical deployment. This performance is sensitive to correspondence errors in the optical flow field, so one approach to improving performance is to use a richer feature set for correspondence, along with calibrated inertial information from the platform to aid correspondence. In this video, we show proof of concept results for such an approach. Estimation results are noisy, but encouraging, and given that SIFT feature correspondence has been demonstrated in real time on low power GPUs, it has the potential for future small UAV integration.",

Our algorithm automatically tunes itself to the problem instance and includes a principled stopping mechanism based on convergence analysis.

These MAVs can fly for long periods of time, consuming only a small fraction(1%) of power compared to purely mechanical MAVs. We demonstrate strategies for harnessing the high energy-density biofuel and high efficiency muscle actuators of insects using tissue-embedded and externally attached miniature insect generated momentum redirectors. Commercial off-the-shelf tail motor, a rudder that exploits flow behind the insect wings, and a steering mechanism that misaligns the thrust directions of two insects were all separately used to control yaw of the hawkmoth, Manduca Sexta, in tethered flight. Untethered flight control of two hawkmoths over 60 m was achieved using a 6 gm backpack, including a 3 gram helium balloon to keep the backpack airborne, for over 5 to 30 minutes of flight time.",

Briefly, the state transition model is responsible for prediction, and the sensor model is responsible for measurement updates. This paper presents a new approach to the sensor model, called the predictive sensor model, which utilizes a prediction mechanism to improve the efficiency of measurement updates in Bayes filters. By adding sensorial anticipation, we extend the original Bayes filter to an anticipatory Bayes filter. We also propose an entropy-based place-segmentation method for automatic segmentation of sequentially collected vision-sensor data. Our place segmentation technique is most useful for node clustering in the process of constructing topological maps. Our work was verified by experiments using observed data.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we discuss the integration of active and passive approaches to robotic safety in an overall scheme for real-time manipulator control. The active control approach is based on the use of a supervisory visual system, which detects the presence and position of humans in the vicinity of the robot arm, and generates motion references. The passive control approach uses variable joint impedance which combines with velocity control to guarantee safety in worst-case conditions, i.e. unforeseen impacts. The implementation of these techniques in a 3-dof, variable impedance arm is described, and the effectiveness of their functional integration is demonstrated through experiments.",

        "abstract": "Motion control algorithms were proposed for a 9-DOF finger-arm robot by using the finger manipulability obtained in a previous study. However, in the previous study, only methods for achieving unconstrained movement of the finger-arm robot were discussed. In this paper, the authors propose a novel method for having a finger-arm robot complete a constrained task by integrating impedance control with manipulability control of the finger. First, methods of applying the previous heuristic method to the passive impedance control and the active impedance control were developed; and experiments were performed to demonstrate the features. Then, an impedance control combined with the steepest ascent method to modulate the manipulability of the finger was proposed. The proposed method demonstrates a strong performance even when a dynamic external force is applied to the finger. By using the proposed method, the arm actively moves along a direction to effectively maintain the moving potential of the finger during both the unconstrained and the constrained tasks.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses an integration issue of multi-level postural balancing on humanoid robot. We give a unified viewpoint of postural balancing, which covers Ankle Strategy to Hip Strategy. Two kinds of distributor of desired ground reaction force to whole-body joint torque are presented. The one distributor leads to a dynamic balancer which covers Hip strategy, with the under-actuated situation. A simple angular momentum regulator is also proposed to stabilize the internal motions due to the joint redundancy. The other distributor leads to a static balancer which lies between Ankle and Hip strategy. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates that replacement of the center of mass feedback with the local joint stiffness makes the robot much stabler for some fast motions. Motivated by the practicability of the static balancer and the strong push-recovery performance of the dynamic balancer, this paper presents a simple integration by superposition of the both balancers on a compliant human-sized biped robot. The simulation and experimental videos are supplemented.",

        "abstract": "Microrobots were proposed more than 20 years ago but it has proven challenging to integrate a power system and actuators into some few mm3. There have been some attempts to create an autonomous mobile microrobot but any has been successful. Moreover, the proposed microrobots were simply mobile platforms incapable of sensing its environment and taking decisions. I-SWARM has been designed to be a real autonomous microrobot. It is powered by solar cells and provided with a locomotion unit for moving, an IR module for communicating and a contact tip for detecting near objects. Those modules are managed by an ASIC designed specifically for I-SWARM. All the electronics (power electronics, buffers, ADCs, DACs, control unit, analog transducers and an oscillator) have been embedded in the ASIC due to the limited area, 3 times 3 mm2. The ASIC is a complete system on chip (SoC) that has several features not reported before in any circuit for microrobots: communicate and act cooperatively with other I-SWARM microrobots, detect near objects, measure distance to an object, light trailing and reprogramability. This paper gives some guidelines to design integrated circuits for microrobots.",

There are a number of methods to estimate the remaining capacity of the robot's batteries.

In this paper, an overview of various battery capacity estimation methodologies will be presented as well as a discussion of a specific implementation utilized on robotic platforms developed at the Center for Distributed Robotics at the University of Minnesota. This approach involves the novel use of fuel-gauging electronics for mobile robotic platforms. Experiments were conducted to show the accuracy of this method for both charge and discharge of the polymer Lithium-ion batteries in use.",

        "abstract": "Human beings can perceive object properties such as size, weight, and material type based solely on the sounds that the objects make when an action is performed on them. In order to be successful, the household robots of the near future must also be capable of learning and reasoning about the acoustic properties of everyday objects. Such an ability would allow a robot to detect and classify various interactions with objects that occur outside of the robot's field of view. This paper presents a framework that allows a robot to infer the object and the type of behavioral interaction performed with it from the sounds generated by the object during the interaction. The framework is evaluated on a 7-d.o.f. Barrett WAM robot which performs grasping, shaking, dropping, pushing and tapping behaviors on 36 different household objects. The results show that the robot can learn models that can be used to recognize objects (and behaviors performed on objects) from the sounds generated during the interaction. In addition, the robot can use the learned models to estimate the similarity between two objects in terms of their acoustic properties.",

In unstructured environments, such information cannot be given to the robot a priori. It is thus critical for the robot to be able to continuously acquire task-specific information about objects. Towards this goal, we present a robust perceptual skill for identifying, tracking, and segmenting objects in a cluttered environment. We increase the robot's perceptual capabilities by closely coupling them with the robot's manipulation skills. The robot's interaction with objects in the environment creates a perceptual signal, i.e. motion, that renders segmentation and tracking robust and reliable. In addition, the resulting perceptual signal reveals the type of segmentation most relevant to manipulation, namely a segmentation of rigidly connected physical bodies. We demonstrate our approach with experiments on a real world mobile manipulation platform with multiple objects in a cluttered scene.",

Its control system and its geometry are designed for performing a wide range of trajectories that could generate cable interferences. This paper presents and analyzes computational methods for determining which cable can be released from an active actuation state while allowing control in a minimal tension state, thereby ensuring that both platforms stay in a controllable workspace. One challaging task is to develop light and fast computational algorithms for hard real time processes included in haptic display applications. Seeing that releasing a cable from an active actuation state might generate discontinuities in tension values in the other cables, this paper proposes collision prediction schemes named Interference Estimated Time of Arrival in order to reduce or completely eliminate such discontinuities.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents inverse position kinematics algorithms with real time capability for Justin, a robotic system with high redundancy and many degrees of freedom. The combination of closed form solutions for parts of the kinematic chain embedded in a nonlinear equation solver is shown to be advantageous. The algorithms are evaluated with DLR's robot Justin both in simulation and reality. Calculation times of 1 ms are achieved, including various optimization criteria for redundancy resolution. In case only a single arm with 7 DoF is considered, a fast calculation time of 250 \u00b5s is reached. With inclusion of an iterative step, reachability can be shown in more than 99% of the calculations regardless of the initial guess. The problem of weighting in multi-criteria optimization problems remains, though in the chosen approach the tool tip position is never compromised by other criteria due to the partially closed form solution. The presented algorithm can be applied to inverse position kinematics for all manipulators with serial or tree structure and redundant joints in case closed form solutions are available for parts of the kinematic chain.",

        "abstract": "In previous studies on 4-DOF parallel mechanisms with four sub-chains, only symmetric arrangement of those four chains connected to the top plate was considered. Such symmetric shape sometimes falls into a sort of architetural singularity. This work demonstrates that an asymmetric placement of the four chains on the top platform is desired to minimize the effect of such architectural singularity. A new 4-DOF parallel mechanism exhibiting 4-DOF motion (3-DOF translational motion and one rotational motion) is examined as an exemplary device. This device consists of a base plate, an upper plate, and four hybrid subchains connecting those two plates together. The position analysis and kinematic modeling for this mechanism are performed, and an optimal design with respect to the workspace size and the kinematic isotropic characteristic is conducted. A set of offset angles on the top platform is found, which significantly minimizes the architectural singularity problem within the valid workspace of the mechanism. Then, through the analysis of the workspace and kinematic isotropic property for the optimized mechanism, its high potential for real applications is confirmed. Finally, the mechanism was developed to verify the motion capability.",

An ejection-free underactuated anthropomorphic hand is of the greatest interest for the field of humanoid robots. So far, all underactuated fingers lead to ejection for certain configurations. By using a second system of actuation in a three-phalanx finger, the zone of instability of this finger is reduced and the ejection problem is prevented. Hence, the mathematical model of this finger is first introduced, followed by the choice of transmission ratios to be taken for the two pulley systems. Finally, the zone of instability of this new architecture is presented where it is proved that ejection is avoided.",

        "abstract": "In this study, kinematics design, dynamics modeling and verification of a compounded serial-parallel wheeled mobile robot is elaborated. The proposed novel kinematic structure is best suited to fulfill stable motion of the robotic system when handling heavy objects by manipulators mounted on mobile platforms. The proposed system is made of a differentially-driven wheeled platform, a planar parallel manipulator, which is called here as Star-Triangle (ST) mechanism, and a serial Puma-type manipulator arm. The suggested structure adopts the advantages of both serial and parallel robots, to move the base point of the serial robot with respect to the mobile platform to fulfill the system stability after grasping heavy objects. In order to investigate the comprehensive kinematics model of the robot, after introducing its novel structure it is divided into three modules, i.e. a mobile platform, a parallel ST mechanism, and a serial robot. Next, a closed-form dynamics model is derived for the whole hybrid system based on a combined Newton-Euler and Lagrange formulation. The proposed method presents the mutual dynamic interaction wrenches between the integrated platform and the serial manipulator which can be exploited for the tip-over stability analysis of the mobile robotic system. Then, to verify the obtained mathematical model, several benchmark actuating inputs are applied to the model and the system responses are analyzed.",

This paper is devoted to the kinematics analysis of this subassembly paying particular attention to the problem of moving the aforementioned attachments without altering the singularity locus of the platform. It is shown how this is always possible provided that some cross-ratios between lines -defined by points in the plane- are kept equal to other cross-ratios between points in the line. This result leads to two simple motion rules upon which complex changes in the location of the attachments can be performed. These rules have interesting practical consequences as they permit a designer to optimize aspects of a parallel robot containing the analyzed subassembly, such as its manipulability in a given region, without altering its singularity locus.",

With recent progress in SLAM techniques, it has become crucial for a robot to estimate the self-position in real-time with respect to a large-size map that can be incrementally build by other mapper robots. Self-localization using large-size maps have been studied in literature, but most of them assume that a complete map is given prior to the self-localization task. In this paper, we present a novel scheme for robot localization as well as map representation that can successfully work with large-size and incremental maps. This work combines our two previous works on incremental methods, iLSH and iRANSAC, for appearance-based and position-based localization.",

        "abstract": "In order to construct three-dimensional shape models of large-scale architectural structures using a laser range finder, a number of range images are taken from various viewpoints. These images are aligned using post-processing procedures such as the ICP algorithm. However, in general, before applying the ICP algorithm, these range images must be aligned roughly by a human operator in order to converge to precise positions. The present paper proposes a new modeling system using a group of multiple robots and an on-board laser range finder. Each measurement position is identified by a highly precise positioning technique called Cooperative Positioning System (CPS), which utilizes the characteristics of the multiple-robot system. Thus, the proposed system can construct 3D shapes of large-scale architectural structures without any post-processing procedure or manual registration. ICP is applied optionally for a subsequent refinement of the model. Measurement experiments in unknown and large indoor/outdoor environments are carried out successfully using the newly developed measurement system consisting of three mobile robots named CPS-V. Generating a model of Dazaifu Tenmangu, a famous cultural heritage, for its digital archive completes the paper.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Navigation and obstacle avoidance in robotics using planar laser scans has matured over the last decades. They basically enable robots to penetrate highly dynamic and populated spaces, such as people's home, and move around smoothly. However, in an unconstrained environment the two-dimensional perceptual space of a fixed mounted laser is not sufficient to ensure safe navigation. In this paper, we present an approach that pools a fast and reliable motion generation approach with modern 3D capturing techniques using a time-of-flight camera. Instead of attempting to implement full 3D motion control, which is computationally more expensive and simply not needed for the targeted scenario of a domestic robot, we introduce a ldquovirtual laserrdquo. For the originally solely laser-based motion generation the technique of fusing real laser measurements and 3D point clouds into a continuous data stream is 100% compatible and transparent. The paper covers the general concept, the necessary extrinsic calibration of two very different types of sensors, and exemplarily illustrates the benefit which is to avoid obstacles not being perceivable in the original laser scan.",

        "abstract": "We propose a learning algorithm for estimating the 3-D orientation of objects. Orientation learning is a difficult problem because the space of orientations is non-Euclidean, and in some cases (such as quaternions) the representation is ambiguous, in that multiple representations exist for the same physical orientation. Learning is further complicated by the fact that most man-made objects exhibit symmetry, so that there are multiple ldquocorrectrdquo orientations. In this paper, we propose a new representation for orientations-and a class of learning and inference algorithms using this representation-that allows us to learn orientations for symmetric or asymmetric objects as a function of a single image. We extensively evaluate our algorithm for learning orientations of objects from six categories.",

To represent an observed movement, a non-linear differential equation is learned such that it reproduces this movement. Based on this representation, we build a library of movements by labeling each recorded movement according to task and context (e.g., grasping, placing, and releasing). Our differential equation is formulated such that generalization can be achieved simply by adapting a start and a goal parameter in the equation to the desired position values of a movement. For object manipulation, we present how our framework extends to the control of gripper orientation and finger position. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated in simulation as well as on the Sarcos dextrous robot arm. The robot learned a pick-and-place operation and a water-serving task and could generalize these tasks to novel situations.",

Motor primitives offer one of the most promising frameworks for the application of machine learning techniques in this context. Employing an improved form of the dynamic systems motor primitives originally introduced by Ijspeert et al. [2], we show how both discrete and rhythmic tasks can be learned using a concerted approach of both imitation and reinforcement learning. For doing so, we present both learning algorithms and representations targeted for the practical application in robotics. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to include a start-up phase in rhythmic primitives. We show that two new motor skills, i.e., Ball-in-a-Cup and Ball-Paddling, can be learned on a real Barrett WAM robot arm at a pace similar to human learning while achieving a significantly more reliable final performance.",

Our method is based on the key idea, that attention can be learned best in concert with visual representations through automatic construction and discretization of the visual state space. The tree representing the top-down attention is incrementally refined whenever aliasing occurs by selecting the most appropriate saccadic direction.

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of estimating the incident angle of a sound, using only a single microphone. The ability to perform monaural (single-ear) localization is important to many animals; indeed, monaural cues are also the primary method by which humans decide if a sound comes from the front or back, as well as estimate its elevation. Such monaural localization is made possible by the structure of the pinna (outer ear), which modifies sound in a way that is dependent on its incident angle. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to monaural localization, using only a single microphone and an ldquoartificial pinnardquo (that distorts sound in a direction-dependent way). Our approach models the typical distribution of natural and artificial sounds, as well as the direction-dependent changes to sounds induced by the pinna. Our experimental results also show that the algorithm is able to fairly accurately localize a wide range of sounds, such as human speech, dog barking, waterfall, thunder, and so on. In contrast to microphone arrays, this approach also offers the potential of significantly more compact, as well as lower cost and power, devices for sounds localization.",

        "abstract": "Despite significant developments in the simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) problem, loop closure detection is still challenging in large scale unstructured environments. Current solutions rely on heuristics that lack generalisation properties, in particular when range sensors are the only source of information about the robot's surrounding environment. This paper presents a machine learning approach for the loop closure detection problem using range sensors. A binary classifier based on boosting is used to detect loop closures. The algorithm performs robustly, even under potential occlusions and significant changes in rotation and translation. We developed a number of features, extracted from range data, that are invariant to rotation. Additionally, we present a general framework for scan-matching SLAM in outdoor environments. Experimental results in large scale urban environments show the robustness of the approach, with a detection rate of 85% and a false alarm rate of only 1%. The proposed algorithm can be computed in real-time and achieves competitive performance with no manual specification of thresholds given the features.",

In an eight-day-long experiment, the robot autonomously detects, tracks, and segments face images during spontaneous interactions with over 500 passersby in public spaces and automatically generates a data set of over 100,000 face images. We describe and evaluate a novel face clustering algorithm using these data (without any manual processing) and also on an existing face recognition database. The face clustering algorithm yields good and robust performance despite the extremely noisy data segmented from the realistic and difficult public environment. In an incremental recognition scheme evaluation, the system is correct 74% of the time when it declares ldquoI don't know this personrdquo and 75.1% of the time when it declares ldquoI know this person, he/she is ...rdquo The latter accuracy improves to 83.8% if the system is allowed some learning curve delay in the beginning.",

In this paper we describe the use of a machine learning algorithm that utilizes signals from an artificial vestibular system that has been embedded in the robot's head. Our approach can rapidly learn to compensate for the head movements that appear when no stabilization mechanism is present. The stabilization using a Sony Aibo robot occurs in only a few gait cycles.",

Demanding performances including high power to mass ratio, capability of producing high power at low speed within a small-occupied volume are some of the key issues that required careful consideration. These criteria aimed to increase autonomy of humanoid robots. In this paper, a novel hydrostatic transmission actuator is proposed. The proposed actuator is controlled by displacement and has capacities for energy storage. This leads to an optimal solution in terms of power consumption. First, the proposed hydrostatic actuation principle is explained. A simplified hydraulic scheme to illustrate the energy storage capability is then provided. A mathematical model of the proposed solution is detailed showing our ability to access to the payload \u201cjerk\u201d. The built prototype is presented and its properties are outlined. Finally, a prototype of the actuator and the preliminary results of the actuator performance are presented, demonstrating the novelty of our solution.",

Programmable pan-and-tilt camera (PPTC) units were designed and implemented as the first step towards enhanced teleoperation control. LineArm, a dual end effector robotic arm, was specifically designed for work on bundled conductors. Design specifications and kinematics of these two subsystems are presented. Implemented application modules to be mounted on LineArm are also presented and their utilization is reported as a milestone in power line live maintenance.

Because only local information is required in determining each agent's Voronoi region, each agent can then make its decision in a distributive fashion based on its allocated Voronoi region. These Voronoi regions eliminates the occurrence of agents executing instantaneous overlapping tasks. As our method does not require a pre-processing of the map, it is also able to work well in a dynamically changing map with changing number of agents. We will show our proof of concept in the problem of exploration in an unknown environment. In our experimental evaluation, we show that our method significantly outperforms the competing algorithms: Ants algorithm and the Brick&Mortar algorithm. Our results also show that our method is near the theoretical best solution.",

In particular, the problem of determining the extrinsic parameters of a bearing sensor mounted on a mobile platform (e.g. a camera) and simultaneously estimating the parameters describing the systematic error in the odometry system is discussed. Special attention is devoted to investigate the dependence of the observability properties of these parameters on the chosen robot trajectory. The main contribution provided by this paper is the introduction of a new method to deal with estimation problems in the framework of mobile robotics. Specifically, a calibration problem has been considered. However, the same method can be adopted to solve other fundamental estimation problems. The method is based on the theory of distributions which exploits all the system Lie symmetries. Regarding the considered calibration problem this method allows analytically detecting the combinations of the calibration parameters which are observable for a given robot trajectory. Experiments are provided to validate the results.",

        "abstract": "A Gaussian Sum Filter (GSF) with component extended Kalman filters (EKF) is proposed as an approach to localize an autonomous vehicle in an urban environment with limited GPS availability. The GSF uses vehicle relative vision-based measurements of known map features coupled with inertial navigation solutions to accomplish localization in the absence of GPS. The vision-based measurements are shown to have multi-modal measurement likelihood functions that are well represented as a weighted sum of Gaussian densities and the GSF is ideally suited to accomplish recursive Bayesian state estimation for this problem. A sequential merging technique is used for Gaussian mixture condensation in the posterior density approximation after fusing multi-modal measurements in the GSF to maintain mixture size over time. The representation of the posterior density with the GSF is compared over a common dataset against a benchmark particle filter solution. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used offline to determine the representational efficiency of the particle filter in terms of an effective number of Gaussian densities. The GSF with vision-based vehicle relative measurements is shown to remain converged using 37 minutes of recorded data from the Cornell University DARPA Urban Challenge (DUC) autonomous vehicle in an urban environment that includes a 32 minute GPS blackout.",

        "abstract": "Piezoelectric-stack actuated platforms are utilized in many nanopositioning applications. Their performance is limited by their low-frequency resonance due to the mechanical construction as well as piezoelectric nonlinear effects. We propose a hybrid control scheme comprising a loop-shaping H\u221e controller and an inversion-based feedforward control scheme, capable of delivering accurate nanopositioning performance at relatively high speeds, upto 40 Hz. It is shown that the implemented control strategy is robust in the presence of uncertainty in resonance frequency due to loading. It is also shown that by employing charge actuation on the fast axis and integral tracking control on the slow axis, accurate raster scans can be obtained. Experimental results that show resonance damping, integral tracking action as well as the robustness of the implemented control scheme to resonance frequency uncertainty are presented. Finally, raster scans recorded at 10 Hz, 20 Hz and 40 Hz are presented to show the achievable positioning performance.",

        "abstract": "The MACCEPA (Mechanically Adjustable Compliance and Controllable Equilibrium Position Actuator) is an electric actuator of which the compliance and equilibrium position are fully independently controllable and both are set by a dedicated servomotor. In this paper an improvement of the actuator is proposed where the torque-angle curve and consequently the stiffness-angle curve can be modified by choosing an appropriate shape of a profile disk, which replaces the lever arm of the former design. The actuator has a large joint angle, torque and stiffness range and these properties can be made beneficial for safe human robot interaction and the construction of energy efficient walking, hopping and running robots. The ability to store and release energy is shown by simulations on a 1DOF hopping robot. Its hopping height is much higher compared to a configuration in which the same motor is used in a traditional stiff setup. The stiffness of the actuator has a stiffening characteristic so the leg stiffness resembles more a linear stiffness as found in humans.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for accurately segmenting and classifying 3D range data into particular object classes. Object classification of input images is necessary for applications including robot navigation and automation, in particular with respect to path planning. To achieve robust object classification, we propose the idea of an object feature which represents a distribution of neighboring points around a target point. In addition, rather than processing raw points, we reconstruct polygons from the point data, introducing connectivity to the points. With these ideas, we can refine the Markov Random Field (MRF) calculation with more relevant information with regards to determining ldquorelated pointsrdquo. The algorithm was tested against five outdoor scenes and provided accurate classification even in the presence of many classes of interest.",

We validate the dipole force model against published experimental data, and demonstrate its application in solving the inverse torque model of a multi-DOF spherical motor, which computes the required set of maximum current inputs for a given design specifications.",

In our view, the solution to this problem consists of two main steps: (i) making robots aware of the network connectivity; and (ii), making use of this knowledge to plan robots tasks without compromising connectivity. In this paper, we view the ad-hoc network connectivity as an abstraction that is independent from application issues. We propose a new distributed algorithm executing on individual robots to build the connectivity-awareness. The correctness and theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm are given. We also show how our solution allows checking network bi-connectivity more efficiently than existing work and can be used, for example, during distributed control motion.",

        "abstract": "We present the Constrained Bi-directional Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (CBiRRT) algorithm for planning paths in configuration spaces with multiple constraints. This algorithm provides a general framework for handling a variety of constraints in manipulation planning including torque limits, constraints on the pose of an object held by a robot, and constraints for following workspace surfaces. CBiRRT extends the Bi-directional RRT (BiRRT) algorithm by using projection techniques to explore the configuration space manifolds that correspond to constraints and to find bridges between them. Consequently, CBiRRT can solve many problems that the BiRRT cannot, and only requires one additional parameter: the allowable error for meeting a constraint. We demonstrate the CBiRRT on a 7DOF WAM arm with a 4DOF Barrett hand on a mobile base. The planner allows this robot to perform household tasks, solve puzzles, and lift heavy objects.",

        "abstract": "We present an approach to path planning for manipulators that uses Workspace Goal Regions (WGRs) to specify goal end-effector poses. Instead of specifying a discrete set of goals in the manipulator's configuration space, we specify goals more intuitively as volumes in the manipulator's workspace. We show that WGRs provide a common framework for describing goal regions that are useful for grasping and manipulation. We also describe two randomized planning algorithms capable of planning with WGRs. The first is an extension of RRT-JT that interleaves exploration using a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) with exploitation using Jacobian-based gradient descent toward WGR samples. The second is the IKBiRRT algorithm, which uses a forward-searching tree rooted at the start and a backward-searching tree that is seeded by WGR samples. We demonstrate both simulation and experimental results for a 7DOF WAM arm with a mobile base performing reaching and pick-and-place tasks. Our results show that planning with WGRs provides an intuitive and powerful method of specifying goals for a variety of tasks without sacrificing efficiency or desirable completeness properties.",

        "abstract": "Mapping opaque and confined environments such as caves and pipes is a challenging problem for mobile robots because sensor information is severely limited to the immediate proximity of the robot due to the extreme environmental conditions. The robot must also be flexible and agile in unstructured environments while still providing accurate pose estimation. This paper presents a solution to mapping a 2-dimensional tube by using only a snake robot's proprioceptive joint angle sensors. We assume that the tube is sufficiently smooth and that we know the tube width. We propose techniques for (1) pose estimation of a snake robot by using a self-posture motion model, (2) correcting error in pose estimation using only the snake's internal configuration over time, and (3) building environmental features using only self-occupancy and contact detection. Our goal is to use the minimal amount of sensor information possible to build an accurate spatial map of the environment. We have tested the proposed techniques in simulated environments and experimental results show that they are both effective and efficient for mapping tube environments. We plan to extend these techniques to deal with more complex confined environments beyond single-path tubes.",

        "abstract": "A new approach to the 3D human motion tracking problem is proposed, which combines several particle filters with a physical simulation of a flexible body model. The flexible body model allows the partitioning of the state space of the human model into much smaller subsets, while finding a solution considering all the partial results of the particle filters. The flexible model also creates the necessary interaction between the different particle filters and allows effective semi-hierarchical tracking of the human body. The physical simulation does not require inverse kinematics calculations and is hence fast and easy to implement. Furthermore the system also builds an appearance model on-the-fly which allows it to work without a foreground segmentation. The system is able to start tracking automatically with a convenient initialization procedure. The implementation runs with 10 Hz on a regular PC using a stereo camera and is hence suitable for Human-Robot Interaction applications.",

We first propose a grasp criterion that yields the best grasping position for a robot hand with two soft fingers. To examine the properties of this criterion with respect to some weighting coefficients included in the criterion, a grasping experiment is performed by humans for planar objects with various sizes and shapes. Results show that many observed grasping positions used by humans correspond to a set of weighting coefficients that equally weigh all the factors in the criterion. A grasping experiment using a robot has also been conducted using a set of coefficients corresponding to the equal weight; the effectiveness of the criterion was confirmed.",

        "abstract": "Active cannulas are a relatively new continuum robot subclass characterized by their use of preshaped tubes that transmit bending moments as they slide within one another and are axially rotated. Previous (experimentally vetted) mechanics-based models of active cannula shape assume piecewise constant precurvature of component tubes, and neglect torsion in curved sections of the device. Recently a general, coordinate-free, energy-based framework for active cannula shape has been formulated that relaxes these requirements and includes all prior models as special cases. However, only the 2-tube, constant-precurvature case has thus far been explored in detail using the framework. In this paper we consider the general case of an arbitrary number of component tubes and precurvatures that vary with arc length, deriving a set of differential equations that capture both bending and torsional effects continuously along the active cannula backbone.We then show how to solve these differential equations numerically to describe active cannula shape.",

To research human machine interaction, the head and neck combination should be able to approach the human behavior as much as possible. We present a novel humanoid neck concept that is both fast, and has a long range of motion in 4 degrees of freedom (DOFs). This enables the head to track fast objects, and the neck design is suitable for mimicking expressions. The humanoid neck features a differential drive design for the lower 2 DOFs resulting in a low moving mass and the ability to use strong actuators. The performance of the neck has been optimized by minimizing backlash in the mechanisms, and by using gravity compensation. Two cameras in the head are used for scanning and interaction with the environment.",

From the perspective of power electronics, such actuators present two challenges: high operating voltages, ranging from tens to thousands of volts, and a low electromechanical coupling factor, which necessitates the recovery of unused electrical energy. This paper explores the power electronics design problem by establishing the drive requirements of piezoelectric actuators, presenting circuit topologies and control methods suitable for driving different types of piezoelectric actuators in microrobotic applications, and demonstrating experimental realizations of sub-100 mg power electronics circuits.",

The mimetic communication consists of imitation learning for learning low level motion primitives and a higher level interaction learning stage in which also the information about the human-robot contacts is included. For the imitation learning, Cartesian marker data from a motion capture system is used. A modification of the low level marker trajectory following algorithm is presented, which allows to reshape the trajectory of the motion primitive in accordance with the human hand motion in real-time. Moreover, for performing safe contact motion, an appropriate impedance controller is integrated into the setting. All the presented concepts are evaluated in experiments with a humanoid robot.",

        "abstract": "In medical and biotechnology fields, soft devices are required because of their high safety from low mechanical impedance. FMA (Flexible Microactuator) is one of the typical soft actuators. It consists of fiber-reinforced rubber structure with multi air chambers and realizes bending motion pneumatically. It has been applied to robot hands, robot legs and so on. High potential of FMA has been confirmed by many experiments reported in several papers. However in fabrication process of the actuator, it is difficult to embed the reinforced fiber in the rubber structure. In this study, we aim at development of a fiber less FMA realizing quite large motion, which can be said curling motion, and a soft hand using the actuators. We design the actuator without fiber using nonlinear FEM (Finite Element Method) and derived efficient shape. The actuator is fabricated through micro rubber casting process including micro machining process for molds, micro vacuum rubber molding process and rubber bonding process with surface improvement by excimer light. Basic driving experiments of the actuator showed that it realized curling motion which agreed well with FEM results. And the actuator could grasp a fish egg without breaking. Additionally, we made a soft hand consisting of three curling actuators. This hand also could be manufactured by simple casting process. The developed hand works opening and closing motions well.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Although there has been an increasing interest in dynamic bipedal locomotion for significant improvement of energy efficiency and dexterity of mobile robots in the real world, their locomotion capabilities are still mostly restricted on flat surfaces. The difficulty of dynamic locomotion in rough terrain is mainly originated in the stability and controllability of gait patterns while exploiting the natural mechanical dynamics of the robots. For a systematic investigation of the challenging problem, this paper presents the simplest control architecture for the compass gait model which can be used for locomotion in rough terrain. Locomotion of the model is mainly achieved by an open-loop oscillator which induces self-stabilizing gait patterns, and we test the proposed control architecture in a real-world robotic platform. In addition, we also found that this controller is capable of varying stride length with a minimum change of control parameters, which enables locomotion in rough terrains. By using these basic principles of self-stability and gait variability, we extended the proposed controller with a simple sensory feedback about the location in the environment, which makes the robot possible to control gait patterns autonomously for traversing a rough terrain. We describe a set of experimental results and discuss how the proposed minimalistic control architecture can be enhanced for dynamic locomotion control in more complex environment.",

Determining significant places provides valuable context information in a variety of applications such as map building, vehicle tracking and user assistance.

Complex simulation models, expensive hardware setup, and a highly controlled environment are often required during various stages of robot development. There is a need for robot developers to have a more flexible approach for conducting experiments and to obtain a better understanding of how robots perceive the world. Mixed Reality (MR) presents a world where real and virtual elements co-exist. By merging the real and the virtual in the creation of an MR simulation environment, more insight into the robot behaviour can be gained, e.g. internal robot information can be visualised, and cheaper and safer testing scenarios can be created by making interactions between physical and virtual objects possible. Robot developers are free to introduce virtual objects in an MR simulation environment for evaluating their systems and obtain a coherent display of visual feedback and realistic simulation results. We illustrate our ideas using an MR simulation tool constructed based on the 3D robot simulator Gazebo.",

The environment representation and mapping system supports both user driven and data driven strategies for the acquisition of spatial information, so that a mixed initiative strategy for the learning process is realised.

        "abstract": "The ability of robotic units to autonomously navigate various terrains is critical to the advancement of robotic operation in natural environments. Next generation robots will need to adapt to their environment in order to accomplish tasks that are either too hazardous, too time consuming, or physically impossible for human-beings. Such tasks may include accurate and rapid explorations of various planets or potentially dangerous areas on Earth. Furthermore, because terrain variability typically increases as the distance that a rover traverses increases, it will be beneficial for robotic units to adapt to their surroundings. As a result, this research investigates a navigation control methodology for a multi-modal locomotive robot based upon passive perception. Surface estimation for robot reconfigurability is implemented using a region growing method, which characterizes the traversability of the terrain, in conjunction with passive perception regarding motion. A mathematical approach is then implemented that inherits human psychological aspects to direct necessary navigation behavior to control robot mobility. Physical experimentations in a simulated Mars yard are presented to validate the methodology.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The state-of-the-art in control of hand prosthetics is far from optimal. The main control interface is represented by surface electromyography (EMG): the activation potentials of the remnants of large muscles of the stump are used in a non-natural way to control one or, at best, two degrees-of-freedom. This has two drawbacks: first, the dexterity of the prosthesis is limited, leading to poor interaction with the environment; second, the patient undergoes a long training time. As more dexterous hand prostheses are put on the market, the need for a finer and more natural control arises. Machine learning can be employed to this end. A desired feature is that of providing a pre-trained model to the patient, so that a quicker and better interaction can be obtained. To this end we propose model adaptation with least-squares SVMs, a technique that allows the automatic tuning of the degree of adaptation. We test the effectiveness of the approach on a database of EMG signals gathered from human subjects. We show that, when pre-trained models are used, the number of training samples needed to reach a certain performance is reduced, and the overall performance is increased, compared to what would be achieved by starting from scratch.",

During experiments, the authors discovered that the insertion force not only depends on the shape discrepancy between the scala tympani and the inserted electrode array, but also on the insertion speed. This paper presents a friction model that describes the whole insertion process and investigates the relationship between the insertion speed and the insertion force. Experimental and statistical results show the effectiveness of the model. Applying the friction model generates safety insertion force boundaries for future insertions and gives the optimal insertion speed. It also provides predictive force information for insertion speed feedback control law design which may be applied to robot-assisted cochlear implant surgeries.",

The first method starts by building an estimated model for the visual-motor forward kinematic of the vision-robot system by a locally linear regression method. Afterwards, it uses a reinforcement learning method named Regularized Fitted Q-Iteration to find a controller (i.e. policy) for the system (model-based RL). The second method directly uses samples coming from the robot without building any intermediate model (model-free RL). The simulation results show that both methods perform comparably well despite not having any a priori knowledge about the robot.",

Traditional force controllers are typically tuned for a specific environment and invariably have instability problems when contacting stiffer environments. This paper presents a new force controller designed to use control effort to compensate for energy losses due to friction without modifying the robots underlying passive dynamics. The controller uses a lossless model of the robot's inertia to predict the robot's motion in real time based on the wave-variables flowing between robot and environment. The model motion is used as a desired input for a wave-variable based controller. To calculate the wave variables the controller uses measurements of both the contact force and the acceleration at the end-effector. The resulting controller is compared analytically and experimentally to more traditional controllers.",

The proposed probabilistic sensor model characterizes the received signal strength indication (RSSI) information as well as the tag detection events to achieve a higher modeling accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models which deal with one of these aspects only. We furthermore propose a method that is able to bootstrap such a sensor model in a fully unsupervised fashion.

        "abstract": "A hybrid controller that induces stable running gaits on a monopedal robot is developed. The robot features a rigid leg with a revolute knee and a heavy torso with center of mass located far from the hip. The torso houses a novel powertrain that provides series compliance in the compression direction of the leg. The proposed control law is developed within the hybrid zero dynamics framework and it acts on two levels. On the first level, continuous within-stride control asymptotically imposes (virtual) holonomic constraints reducing the dynamics of the robot to a lower-dimensional hybrid subsystem. On the second level, event-based control stabilizes the resulting hybrid subsystem. The controller achieves the dual objectives of working harmoniously with the system's natural dynamics and inducing provably exponentially stable running motions, while all relevant physical constraints are respected.",

When operating in high sea state, operation of such manipulators can be made more efficient and robust if these non-inertial effects are taken into account in the motion planning and control systems. Motivated by this application, we present a rigorous and singularity-free formulation of the dynamics of a robotic manipulator mounted on a non-inertial base. We extend the classical dynamics equations for a serial manipulator to include the 6-DoF motion of the non-inertial base. Then, we show two examples of a 1-DoF and a 4-DoF manipulator to illustrate how these non-inertial effects can be taken into account in the motion planning.",

However, understanding of the kinematics and dynamics of such a robotic platform is challenging due to the complex wheel/ground interactions and kinematic constraints. In this paper, we attempt to develop a kinematic and dynamic modeling scheme to analyze the skid-steered mobile robot. We model wheel/ground interaction and analyze the robot motion stability. As an application example, we present how to utilize the kinematic and dynamic modeling and analysis for robot localization and slip estimation using only low-cost strapdown inertial measurement units (IMU). The extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based localization scheme incorporates the kinematic constraints. The performance of the EKF-based localization and slip estimation scheme are presented. The estimation methodology is tested and validated on a robotic testbed.",

Classical nonlinear theory of thin shells [21, pp. 186-194] is generalized to shells with arbitrary parametric middle surfaces, using a method introduced in our earlier work [13]. An experimental study demonstrates higher modeling accuracy using the nonlinear elasticity theory than its linear counterpart. Given that many deformable objects undergo sizable shape changes when they are grasped, our result supports the application of nonlinear elasticity theory in the future design of grasp strategies for this type of objects.",

We show images from different viewpoints can be obtained by using a monocular system. In the proposed method, stereo image analysis is carried out by using a viewpoint switching iris. A prototype of the viewpoint switching iris has be developed, which can be used along with a monocular camera for distance measurement. Furthermore, we have verified that this system can be used to a moving object by using a compensation method.",

Due to signal source anonymity, short transmission durations, and dynamic transmission patterns, the robot cannot treat the radio sources as continuous radio beacons.We model the radio source behaviors using a novel spatiotemporal probability occupancy grid (SPOG) that captures transient characteristics of radio transmissions and tracks the spatiotemporal posterior probability distribution of the radio transmissions. As a Monte Carlo method, we propose a ridge walking motion planning algorithm that enables the robot to efficiently traverse the high probability regions to accelerate the convergence of the posterior probability distribution. We have implemented the algorithms and the experiment results show that our method consistently outperforms methods such as a random walk or a fixed-route patrol mechanism.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Kinematically redundant manipulators are coveted for their ability to perform more complex and a greater variety of tasks than their non-redundant counterparts. This increased utility demands that manipulator designs be carefully optimized to achieve the kinematic dexterity required to perform their numerous intended tasks. The optimization of redundant manipulator designs to improve isotropy has been studied at great length, but a vast majority of the work done focuses on planar manipulation tasks and workspaces that, unlike many modern manufacturing environments, offer few or no physical impediments to motion. In this paper we investigate the incorporation of secondary manipulation goals, in particular obstacle avoidance, into the calculation of kinematic isotropy measures. We will use these weighted isotropy measures as a performance metric for redundant manipulators working in obstacle-laden workspaces, and employ the metric as part of an objective function for a global search design optimization problem. The effectiveness of the weighted isotropy design optimization will be demonstrated by increasing the global dexterity of a sub-optimal seven degree-of-freedom manipulator design used for pick-and-place tasks within a small, enclosed workspace.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a cognitive approach for object tracking from a mobile platform. The approach is based on a biologically motivated attention system which is able to detect regions of interest in images based on concepts of the human visual system. A top-down guided visual search module of the system enables to especially favor features which fit to a previously learned target object. Here, the appearance of an object is learned online within the first image in which it is detected. In subsequent images, the attention system searches for the target features and builds a top-down, target-related saliency map. This enables to focus on the most relevant features of especially this object in especially this scene without knowing anything about a particular object model or scene in advance. The system is able to operate in real-time and to cope with the requirements of real-world tasks such as illumination variations and other moving objects.",

Dynamic and kinematic models, operational space, computed torque, discrete state space and stochastic design are addressed in the control. Inner loops are based on position and velocity signals and outer loops have force measurements. Two active observers (AOBs) are introduced for force control and motion compensation. The first AOB is responsible for model-reference adaptive control to guarantee a desired closed loop dynamics for the force. The second AOB performs control actions to compensate physiological motions. Such motions are described by a second-order stochastic equation, without apriori knowledge of signal characteristics. Simulation results are presented for sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal motions, highlighting merits of the approach.",

        "abstract": "Impedance type devices are frequently used in haptics due to their excellent rendition of free-space, low cost, and convenience. The spring drive, a recently proposed alternative to the traditional current motor driver for such devices, has been shown to improve their stiffness in rigid contact by moving the haptic coupling from the digital domain to analog circuitry. Unlike the current drive, which operates the motor as a force source, the spring drive converts the motor to a motion source. In this paper we construct a motion-based virtual environment to fully leverage the benefits of operating an impedance device with motion control. This quasi-static environment is connected to a mid-level controller which interfaces with the analog motor drive. A full system analysis and experimental demonstration verify the anticipated performance.",

Then, by utilizing the first inherence, the Rest-to-Point motion planning problem for the backswing and downswing is transformed into a reverse time symmetric Point-to-Rest motion planning problem. Finally, based on the second inherence, a Proportional plus Gravity and Coupling Torque Compensation (PGCTC) control scheme is developed to solve both the reverse time symmetric Point-to-Rest motion planning problem for the backswing and downswing and the forward time Point-to-Rest problem for the follow-through.

The proposed approach tries to mimic the real human hand motions, but reducing the dimension of the search space in order to obtain results as a compromise between motion optimality and planning complexity (time) by means of the concept of principal motion directions. Basically, the work includes the following phases: capturing the human hand workspace using a sensorized glove and mapping it to the mechanical hand workspace, reducing the space dimension by looking for the most relevant principal motion directions, and planning the hand movements using a sampling-based roadmap planner. The approach has been implemented for a four finger anthropomorphic mechanical hand, and some examples are included to illustrate its validity.",

Mouth segmentation is performed by using the normalized a* component, as in J. Gomez, et al., (October 2008). The gesture detection process is carried out by a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based classifier. After that, a state machine stabilizes the system response by restricting the number of possible movements depending on the initial state. Voice commands are modeled using a hidden Markov model (HMM) isolated word recognition scheme. The interface was designed taking into account the specific pose restrictions found in the DaVinci assisted surgery command console.",

A set of dynamically optimal leg swing motion primitives for irregular terrains is first constructed offline-this is done by generating minimum torque motions for various starting and ending ground configurations, extracting dominant principal components, and forming basis functions. Gaits are then generated online via linear interpolation of the principal component basis functions, using a distance metric on SO(3) to select the components. The algorithm is verified via dynamic simulations involving the STriDER, a three legged passive-walking robot. Our results show that gaits using only knee-actuated leg swings are able to traverse uneven terrain of bounded variation.",

        "abstract": "Motivated by two potential applications, i.e. enhancing driving safety and traffic data collection, a system has been developed using a single-layer horizontal laser scanner as the major sensor for both localization and perception of the surroundings in a large dynamic urban environment. This research focuses on a classification method, that given a stream of laser measurements, classify the moving object into either a person, a group of people, a bicycle or a car. In this research, a number of features are defined after examining the property of data appearance. A classification method is proposed after examining the likelihood measures between each pair of feature and class. Experimental results are presented, demonstrating that the algorithm has efficiency with respect to both driving safety and traffic data collection in highly dynamic environment.",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of vision-based multi-person tracking in busy pedestrian zones using a stereo rig mounted on a mobile platform. Specifically, we are interested in the application of such a system for supporting path planning algorithms in the avoidance of dynamic obstacles. The complexity of the problem calls for an integrated solution, which extracts as much visual information as possible and combines it through cognitive feedback. We propose such an approach, which jointly estimates camera position, stereo depth, object detections, and trajectories based only on visual information. The interplay between these components is represented in a graphical model. For each frame, we first estimate the ground surface together with a set of object detections. Based on these results, we then address object interactions and estimate trajectories. Finally, we employ the tracking results to predict future motion for dynamic objects and fuse this information with a static occupancy map estimated from dense stereo. The approach is experimentally evaluated on several long and challenging video sequences from busy inner-city locations recorded with different mobile setups. The results show that the proposed integration makes stable tracking and motion prediction possible, and thereby enables path planning in complex and highly dynamic scenes.",

When we manipulate complex structures such as microtools, a multi-beam optical tweezers which can manipulate multiple objects is suitable; however manipulation speed or trapping number are not so good. Therefore, we developed an integrated optical tweezers by using time-shared scanning method for high speed manipulation and generalized phase contrast method for a lot of trapping. Then, we proposed cell manipulation method which suits for the integrated optical tweezers and then we designed the shape of microtools made of SU-8. A new fabrication method of SU-8 microtools was proposed to improve productivity. At last, we made the experiment system and the effectiveness of proposed methods was confirmed.",

More specifically, given a set of robots, their initial and final configurations, and possibly some additional coordination constraints, our goal is to compute a collision-free path between the initial and final configuration that maintains the constraints. To solve this problem, our approach generalizes the social potential field method to be applicable to both convex and nonconvex polyhedra. Social potential fields are then integrated into a \u201cphysics-based motion planning\u201d framework which uses constrained dynamics to solve the motion planning problem. Our approach is able to plan for over 200 robots while averaging about 110 ms per step in a variety of environments.",

The algorithm selects correspondences between previous and current spatial features by the application of pairwise constraints, and generates the transformation function with a fast regular grid approximation which minimizes distortion. The algorithm requires minimal domain knowledge, is capable of transforming the spatial aspects of collaborative team behavior and performs better in noisy problems with large displacements than the most generally used quadratic differences method. The algorithm can be utilized for rapid plan adaptation, plan generalization or team behavior imitation. Methods are demonstrated on a multi-robot control problem in a random environment.",

The objective of MR-LDR is to find an assignment of targets to robots and a path for each robot that maximizes the surplus, which is defined to be the total reward collected by the team minus its total travel cost. We develop a mixed integer program that solves MR-LDR optimally with a flow-type formulation and can be solved faster than the standard TSP-type formulations but also show that solving MR-LDR optimally is NP-hard. We then develop an auction-based algorithm and demonstrate that it solves MR-LDR in seconds and with a surplus that is comparable to the surplus found by the mixed integer program with a 12 hour time limit.",

We believe that the algorithm performs well on any graph, and this is substantiated by simulations. For trees with n edges and radius r, the exploration time is 2n/k + O(rk-1), improving a recent method with O(n/log k + r) [1], and almost reaching the lower bound max (2n/k, 2r). The algorithm is meant to be used in indoor navigation or cave search scenarios where the environment can be modeled as a graph. In this scenario, communication is realized by the devices being dropped by the robots at explored vertices, and the states of which are read and changed by further visiting robots. Simulations on Player/Stage platform have been performed in both tree and graph exploration which corroborate the mathematical results.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a framework for generating time-optimal velocity profiles for a group of path-constrained vehicle robots that have fixed and known initial and goal locations and are required to maintain communication connectivity. Each robot must follow a fixed and known path, arrive at its goal as quickly as possible (or at least not increase the time for the last robot to arrive at its goal) and stay in communication with other robots in the arena throughout its journey. The main contribution of this paper is the formulation of the problem as a discrete time nonlinear programming problem (NLP) with constraints on robot kinematics, dynamics, collision avoidance, and communication connectivity. We develop partition elimination constraints that assist in ensuring that the communication network is fully connected (no network partitions). These constraints are enforced only when network partitions would otherwise occur, an approach which significantly reduces the problem size and the required computational effort. In addition, we introduce path-constrained jammer robots with known paths and velocity profiles into the scenario. These jammer robots have an effective jamming range and disrupt all communications within this range. Except for the jammers, all robots must remain outside this jamming range at all times. We investigate the scalability of the proposed approach by testing scenarios involving up to fifty (50) robots. Solutions demonstrate (i) the trade off between the arrival time and the communication connectivity requirements in scenarios with and without jamming; and (ii) the dependence of computation time on the number of robots.",

The objective is to find multiple fixed length paths for multiple vehicles with the following properties: (i) bounded curvature (ii) obstacle avoidant (iii) collision free. Our approach is based on polygonal approximation of a continuous curve. Using this idea, we formulate an arbitrarily fine relaxation of the path planning problem as a nonconvex feasibility optimization problem. Then, we propound a nonsmooth dynamical systems approach to find feasible solutions of this optimization problem. It is shown that the trajectories of the nonsmooth dynamical system always converge to some equilibria that correspond to the set of feasible solutions of the relaxed problem. The proposed framework can handle more complex mission scenarios for multi-vehicle systems such as rendezvous and area coverage.",

        "abstract": "Robust ego-motion estimation in urban environments is a key prerequisite for making a robot truly autonomous, but is not easily achievable as there are two motions involved: the motions of moving objects and the motion of the robot itself. We proposed a random sample consensus (RANSAC) based ego-motion estimator to deal with highly dynamic environments using one planar laser scanner. Instead of directly sampling on individual measurements, the RANSAC process is performed at a higher level abstraction for systematic sampling and computational efficiency. We proposed a multiple-model approach to solve the problems of ego-motion estimation and moving object detection jointly in a RANSAC paradigm. To accommodate RANSAC to multiple models - a static environment model for ego-motion estimation and a moving object model for moving object detection, a compact representation models moving object information implicitly is proposed. Moving objects are successfully detected without incorporating any grid maps, that are inherently time and space consuming. The experimental results show that accurate identification of static environments can help classification of moving objects, whereas discrimination of moving objects also yields better ego-motion estimation, particularly in environments containing a significant percentage of moving objects.",

The main objective of this paper is to develop a method for estimating muscle tensions without any sensors attached to the body. Muscle tension is an important information for evaluating physical load during motions. Existing approaches utilizing optimization techniques and/or electromyography (EMG) signals are not appropriate due to lack of physiological validity or usage of electrodes. In this paper, we propose to use a database of muscle tension distribution for obtaining physiologically realistic muscle tensions only from motion data. Using such database instead of direct EMG measurement is justified by the fact that muscle tension distribution is relatively highly correlated even among different subjects. For each new motion frame, we search for a similar entry in the database and use the corresponding muscle tension distribution to estimate the current muscle tensions. We demonstrate that the muscle tensions obtained by this approach is much closer to the result using the EMG data than that using pure numerical optimization, even when the database is constructed from other person's data.",

Traditionally, arm linkage and drive mechanism are first designed followed by control design. The integrated design method is proposed as a preferable technique of the traditional one. In this paper, a general framework of the integrated design method for a point-to-point control is presented. The dynamic model for a flexible planar two-link manipulator is derived by the finite element method. The PD control strategy is applied in the closed-loop system. The structural parameters and control parameters are optimized simultaneously by solving the integrated design problem. The differential evolution (DE) technique, a global optimization technique, is used to solve the optimal design problem. A simulation shows the integrated design method gives improved system performance.",

The role of this component has been completely ignored in past studies on self motion. It is shown that Jacobian pseudoinverse-based resolution - the usual resolution method for nonlinear self-motion - yields poor dynamic performance. A special type of self motion is identified based on the natural metric on the self-motion manifold and the energy conservation principle. This type of self motion is shown to have superior dynamics in terms of torque requirement and to avoid abrupt fluctuations in acceleration in the vicinity of singular points.",

        "abstract": "Stigmergy is a mechanism that allows the coordination of actions within the same agent or across different agents by means of traces left in the environment. We propose a stigmergetic approach to robot navigation in which a robot sets values in a hexagonal grid of RFID tags buried under the floor. This approach only requires minimal resources on the robot. The RFID floor will eventually contain a distance map that can guide the robot to a given goal (or set of goals) without the use of any localization system. The same map can be used or improved by other robots or by the same robot at later times. We define algorithms for building the RFID-floor map and for navigating on this map, we prove the convergence of the map building algorithm, and we show an empirical validation of our results using a small robot in a domestic environment.",

        "abstract": "In the autonomous city explorer (ACE) project a mobile robot is developed, which is capable of finding its way to a given destination in an unknown urban environment. An exemplary mission is to find the way from our institute to the Marienplatz, a public place in the center of Munich, without any prior knowledge or GPS information. Inspired by the behavior of humans in unknown environments, ACE must find its way by asking pedestrians. The route is about 1.5 kilometers far and includes heavily traveled roads and crowded public places. In order to navigate safely in an unknown urban environment, some challenges arise for the vision system. Robust human detection, tracking and the estimation of human body poses is essential for natural interaction with pedestrians. Furthermore, the robot needs to be able to detect sidewalk and crossroads. A visual odometry system is used to support the conventional navigation. Outdoor experiments were conducted twice successfully. After about 5 hours and interacting with 25 and 38 persons respectively, ACE arrived the Marienplatz. This paper describes both, an architecture of the vision system used for ACE and the algorithms used to deal with the described challenges.",

A geometric condition for the existence of singularities is extended to be used in interval analysis. Therefore, we eliminate the need of calculating the inconvenient interval form of the Jacobian's determinant. Hence, an appropriate description of the singularity-free workspace is obtained and the computational effort is reduced significantly. With the interval-based approach error sources, like manufacturing tolerances, can be considered. Consequently, regions that do not satisfy the proposed condition can be guaranteed not to have any type-two singularities. Several analysis examples demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed geometrical-based solver in comparison to existing solvers, i.e. based on the Jacobian's determinant.",

In our prior work reported at IEEE/ASME AIM 2007, we demonstrated several prototype propulsive units (with asymmetric capacitor configurations) that lift themselves into air. Using these basic propulsive units (\u201cIonic Flyers\u201d), we have recently developed an indoor flying blimp that has a propulsion system with no moving mechanical parts and thus generates no noise or vibration - the Ionic Propulsion Blimp. The key to successfully create this novel indoor flying system is the development of a power generation system that includes an 11.1V battery which is capable of generating \u223c20kV DC voltage continuously over time for a load in the M\u03a9 range. The architecture of this ionic power system will be presented. A detailed parametric analysis and an optimal design methodology of the Ionic Flyer are also discussed. Initial experimental results of the Ionic Propulsion Blimp are also summarized in this paper.",

The master handles a tool where a plate is attached at the tip of a bar, and he remotely manipulates a pizza on the plate. We found that he aggressively utilizes two DOFs (degrees of freedom), such that the linear motion along the bar and the rotational one around the bar, in order to produce quick plate motions for dynamically manipulating the object. Applying this handling mechanism to the robot system, we first show how to rotate an object by using the two DOFs of plate motion. We then reveal that the deformation of the object generated by dynamic effects can drastically contribute to high-speed and stable rotation, just like human steps for turn on the floor. By both simulation and experiment, we show that there exists the optimum plate motion leading to the maximum rotational speed of the object.",

        "abstract": "Buckling is a highly nonlinear and singular phenomenon in thin beams, and is usually an undesired characteristic that must be prevented from occurring in engineered systems. Buckling, however, can be a useful mechanism for gaining extremely large displacement amplification, since a tiny displacement in the axial direction of the beam may lead to a large defection in the middle of the beam. This paper presents a novel large-strain piezoelectric actuator exploiting the buckling of a structure with imbedded PZT stacks. Although the free displacement of a PZT stack is only 0.1% of the stack length, the buckling mechanism, controlled with an effective algorithm and strategically placed redirecting stiffness, can produce a large bi-polar displacement that is approximately 150 times larger than the original PZT displacement. Furthermore, the structural buckling produces a pronounced nonlinearity in output impedance; the effective stiffness viewed from the output port varies as a function of output displacement, which can be a useful property for those applications where actuator stiffness needs to vary.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a novel design of a 3-axis force sensor which can be applied in magnetic resonance (MR) workspaces such as that of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine. The sensor operates based on an optical sensing principle to measure forces deforming a 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) flexible structure. By detecting minute deflection of such a structure using an optical sensing scheme, the magnitude and direction of an applied force can be determined. The sensor prototype described in this document demonstrates its capability of performing force measurement in both axial and radial directions with the calibrated working ranges of +/-3 N. Because all the sensor's components are entirely fabricated from non-metallic and dielectric materials, the sensor is considered suitable for applications in MR environments.",

The paper first discusses the geometric grammar as a compact representation form for object categories with primitive parts as its constituent elements. The paper then discusses the object classification implemented as parsing of primitive parts. In particular, two approaches are discussed that constrain the search space in order to render the parsing of the primitive parts practical. The two approaches are experimentally verified, first, for a generic object category of chair applied to real range images acquired with a range camera mounted on a mobile robot and, second, for multiple generic object categories applied to synthetic range images. The experimental results show the practicability of the framework.",

The idea is to enhance real-time object handling tasks based on tactile sensing in humanoid robotics, where grasp, move and release motions are involved. We developed a novel hemisphere-shaped optical three-axis tactile sensor to mount on fingertips of the robot arm. The tactile sensor is capable of defining normal and shearing forces simultaneously. For grasp and release motions, we designed the algorithm based on slippage direction analysis consisting of coordinate transformation of the sensing element for the arm global coordinate. The robot control system uses the analysis results to determine whether an object is in contact with the ground without needing to measure the height of the ground. The algorithm was evaluated in experiments with soft and hard objects, whereby results revealed good performance for the robot fingers in handling an object at an arbitrary position.",

From the viewpoint of improving the operative efficiency of the cooperative task, we designed a novel robot control system, in which inherent dynamics of the target task and the object is conserved. The proposed control scheme differs widely from an ordinary impedance control scheme in that the inherent dynamics of the target task and the object is substituted by impedance characteristics. Under the proposed control scheme, the dynamics of the target task and that of the robot motion are uncoupled and independent. The proposed control system enables the human operator to carry out the cooperative task intuitively by only considering the inherent dynamics of the target task and the object. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control system, an experiment base on a peg insertion task involving human-robot cooperation is carried out. The experimental results show that the proposed control scheme is effective for cooperative tasks requiring precision.",

In this context, full pose estimation of relevant objects in a scene is a critical step towards the introduction of robots into household environments. In this paper, we present an approach for building metric 3D models of objects using local descriptors from several images. Each model is optimized to fit a set of calibrated training images, thus obtaining the best possible alignment between the 3D model and the real object. Given a new test image, we match the local descriptors to our stored models online, using a novel combination of the RANSAC and Mean Shift algorithms to register multiple instances of each object. A robust initialization step allows for arbitrary rotation, translation and scaling of objects in the test images. The resulting system provides markerless 6-DOF pose estimation for complex objects in cluttered scenes. We provide experimental results demonstrating orientation and translation accuracy, as well a physical implementation of the pose output being used by an autonomous robot to perform grasping in highly cluttered scenes.",

Microscopic observations for several needle-gel interactions were used to characterize the interactions at the bevel tip and along the needle shaft. The model design was guided by microscopic observations of several needle-gel interactions. The energy-based model formulation incorporates tissue-specific parameters such as rupture toughness, nonlinear material elasticity, and interaction stiffness, and needle geometric and material properties. Simulation results follow similar trends (deflection and radius of curvature) to those observed in macroscopic experimental studies of a robot-driven needle interacting with different kinds of gels. These results contribute to a mechanics-based model of robotic needle steering, extending previous work on kinematic models.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents Cramer-Rao bound-like inequalities for pose tracking, which is defined as the problem of recovering the robot displacement given two successive readings of a relative sensor. Computing the exact Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for pose tracking is hard, because the state comprises the map, which is infinite-dimensional and unknown. This paper shows that the FIM for pose tracking can be bounded by a function of the FIM for localization on a known map, thereby reducing the analysis to a finite-dimensional problem. The resulting bounds are independent of the map prior and representation. The results are valid for any relative sensor; the experimental verification is done for the particular case of pose tracking using range-finders (scan matching).",

        "abstract": "Today, pressured air and gas leaks are typically detected using in-situ sensor technology. In this contribution the application of passive IR-thermography is proposed to permit remote leak detection by assessing the resulting temperature profile disturbance due to expansion of pressured gas. Remote measurements are advantageous as they are easier and safer to conduct. Scanning high-rise objects can be achieved using a ground-bound system without requiring complex climbing. In the paper a novel method for automated leak detection by feature extraction and pattern recognition is presented. This enables autonomous mobile robots with remote leak detection capability.",

The key idea of the presented work is the demonstration that wrenches associated to any three non-aligned contact points of 3D objects form a basis of their corresponding wrench space. This result permits the formulation of a new sufficient force-closure test. Our approach works with general objects, modelled with a set of points, and with any number n of contacts (n ges 4). A quality criterion is also introduced. A corresponding algorithm for computing robust force-closure grasps has been developed. Its efficiency is confirmed by comparing it to the classical convex-hull method [26].",

The robots, each one pursuing its leading neighbor along the line of sight rotated by a common offset angle, are supposed to have a communication set described by a disk of constant radius. Given the initial position of the agents, we determine the communication radii that preserve the connectivity of the robots while they rendezvous at a point or converge to an evenly spaced circle formation. The special case that the initial condition is a linear combination of the eigenvectors of the dynamic matrix of the system, is studied in detail. On the other hand, given the communication radii, we find the set of initial conditions that guarantee the robots remain always connected. As a final contribution, once assigned a ldquonon-optimalrdquo radius, we study the stability of the hybrid system describing the dynamics of the robotic network under variable connectivity levels.",

Their mechanisms are very complicated and their roles in dynamic biped locomotion are still unclear. This paper then investigates how the gait efficiency changes with the asymmetrization through analysis of a simple rimless wheel model. We mathematically show that the symmetric configuration gives the optimal solution when the mean value of the inter-leg angles is constant in terms of kinetic energy. This is derived from two magnitude relations of the energy-loss coefficient and restored mechanical energy. We also show that the symmetric gait is not always optimal from another viewpoint.",

Given an unorganized 3D point cloud, our algorithm recreates the underlying surface's geometrical properties using data resampling and a robust triangulation algorithm in near realtime. For resulting smooth surfaces, the data is resampled with variable densities according to previously estimated surface curvatures. Incremental scans are easily incorporated into an existing surface mesh, by determining the respective overlapping area and reconstructing only the updated part of the surface mesh. The proposed framework is flexible enough to be integrated with additional point label information, where groups of points sharing the same label are clustered together and can be reconstructed separately, thus allowing fast updates via triangular mesh decoupling. To validate our approach, we present results obtained from laser scans acquired in both indoor and outdoor environments.",

In particular, we introduce a new sampling strategy that minimizes the linearization error and whose computational complexity is constant (i.e., independent of the size of the state vector). As a result, the overall computational complexity of UKF-based SLAM becomes of the same order as that of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) when applied to SLAM. Furthermore, we investigate the observability properties of the linear-regression-based model employed by the UKF, and propose a new algorithm, termed the Observability-Constrained (OC)-UKF, that improves the consistency of the state estimates. The superior performance of the OC-UKF compared to the standard UKF and its robustness to large linearization errors are validated by extensive simulations.",

        "abstract": "Physics-based animation is becoming an essential feature for any advanced simulation software. In this paper we explore potential benefits of physics-based modeling for task programming in virtual reality. Firstly, we show how realistic animation of manipulation tasks can be exploited for learning sequential constraints from user demonstrations. In particular, we propose a method where information about physical interaction is used to discover task precedences and to reason about task similarities at the goal level. A second contribution of the paper is the application of physics-based modeling to the problem of disassembly sequence planning. Experiments have been performed in a desktop virtual reality environment with dataglove and motion tracker.",

We propose a switching control method based on local sensor-based information for the group of robots. If the distance between leader and follower robots is larger than the switching threshold, a nonlinear control law is employed to make the followers move effectively toward the leader robot; otherwise, finite-time control based on feedback linearization is used to quickly stabilize the relative distance and orientation of the follower robots. Both stability analysis and simulations are provided and moreover, the formation control of Pioneer 3-AT mobile robots by the proposed method is shown.",

        "abstract": "Recent works have shown that it is possible to solve the Simultaneous Localization And Mapping problem using an Extended Kalman Filter and a single perspective camera. The principal drawback of these works is an inaccurate modeling of measurement uncertainties, which therefore causes inconsistencies in the filter estimations. A possible solution to proper uncertainty modeling is the Unified Inverse Depth parametrization. In this paper we propose the Inverse Scaling parametrization that still allows an un-delayed initialization of features, while reducing the number of needed parameters and simplifying the measurement model. This novel approach allows a better uncertainty modeling of both low and high parallax features and reduces the likelihood of inconsistencies. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that the use of the Inverse Scaling solution improves the performance of the monocular EKF SLAM filter when compared with the Unified Inverse Depth approach; experiment on real data confirm the applicability of the idea.",

Novelty of this paper is summarized as follows. (1) We employed neodium powder as the main component of MMT. The density of magnetic flux was improved about 100 times larger after magnetization. (2) We fabricated a pair of magnetic sharp needles in the chip by electroplating. MMT was placed between the needles and the density of magnetic flux was improved about 3 times larger. As a result, we succeeded in powerful actuation of MMT in a chip. Drive frequency was improved about 10 times faster (up to 180 Hz). We applied it for sorting of copolymer beads in a chip. MMT is put in the microchannel. The size of the bead was measured by image processing (15 Hz). Moving frequency of the MMT was made higher than the sampling frequency of measurement and secure sorting was achieved.",

        "abstract": "Navigation of a car-like robot in environments with unknowns requires effective on-line planning of nonholonomic trajectories. We propose a set of basic maneuver patterns based on Bezier curves that allow either forward or backward motion as building blocks to create nonholonomic trajectories quickly, given a sequence of knot positions/points (e.g., from some GPS navigator). These maneuver patterns are particularly useful for generating feasible trajectories in crowded environments with many narrow passages. We embed the above techniques in a new planner suitable for on-line planning of nonholonomic and collision-free trajectories, called the ON planner. Our ON planner enables that, given a sequence of rough knot points, a car-like robot can simultaneously plan and move in a geometrically unknown, crowded environment with local sensing towards a goal. Simulation results demonstrate the planner's nice capabilities.",

Starting from a discretized convex reformulation of time-optimal path tracking problems, a log-barrier based batch solution method is presented which allows to rapidly obtain an approximate solution with smooth actuator torques. Based on this batch method, a recursive variant is derived for on-line path tracking. By means of an experimental test case in which the path data is generated on-line by human demonstration, the results and trade-offs in calculation time, delay and path duration are compared for the batch and recursive variant of the log-barrier method as well as for an exact solution method.",

Unfortunately, this performance increase is often at the cost of time consuming, memory intensive learning and slow inference at testing time. Structured prediction for 3-D point cloud classification is one example of such an application. In this paper we present two contributions. First we show how efficient learning of a random field with higher-order cliques can be achieved using subgradient optimization. Second, we present a context approximation using random fields with high-order cliques designed to make this model usable online, onboard a mobile vehicle for environment modeling. We obtained results with the mobile vehicle on a variety of terrains, at 1/3 Hz for a map 25 times 50 meters and a vehicle speed of 1-2 m/s.",

        "abstract": "Robotic capture of a tumbling target-satellite means that the space robot's hand and the target grapple point arrive at a rendezvous point with the same velocity and then the chase vehicle mechanically connects into the target using a grapple device. This paper is focused on optimal control of the space manipulator in the postcapture phase so as to bring the tumbling non-cooperative satellite to rest in minimum time while ensuring that the magnitude of the interaction torque between the manipulator and target remains below a prescribed value. First, we seek fast detumbling maneuvers of the target satellite subjected to the torque restriction. The theory of optimal control and Pontryagin's principle are applied to obtain a closed-form solution for the optimal path planning problem, giving a great deal of insight: the vector of the interaction torque is aligned opposite to the direction of the instantaneous angular momentum vector. Second, a coordination control for combined system of the space robot and the target satellite, which acts as the manipulator payload, is developed so that the robot tracks the optimal path while regulating the attitude of the chase vehicle to a desired value. A preliminary illustrative example is appended.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a distributed control strategy for deploying hovering robots with multiple downward facing cameras to collectively monitor an environment. Information per pixel is proposed as an optimization criterion for multi-camera placement problems. This metric is used to derive a specific cost function for multiple downward facing cameras mounted on hovering robot platforms. The cost function leads to a gradient-based distributed controller for positioning the robots. A convergence proof using LaSalle's invariance principle is given to show that the robots converge to locally optimal positions. The controller is demonstrated in experiments with three flying quad-rotor robots.",

        "abstract": "For haptic devices, compensation of the robot's gravity is a frequent strategy with the aim to reduce interaction forces between robot and human in zero-impedance control. However, a closer look at the composition of these interaction forces may reveal that the net effect of uncompensated gravitational components of the robot actually reduces interaction forces during dynamic movements, because inertial and gravitational components at least partially compensate each other. This is the case in lower extremity exoskeletons, where less user force is necessary to swing the robot's leg when gravity helps. Here, we go one step further by shaping optimal passive dynamics for arbitrary haptic devices. The proposed method of generalized elasticities uses conservative force fields to improve haptic transparency for certain movements types. In an example realization, these force fields are generated by elasticities spanning multiple joints. Practical experiments with the Lokomat lower extremity exoskeleton show the success of the proposed method in terms of reduced interaction torques and more physiological user motion compared to gravity compensation.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Stereo camera systems are widely used in many real applications including indoor and outdoor robotics. They are very easy to use and provide accurate depth estimates on well-textured scenes, but often fail when the scene does not have enough texture. It is possible to help the system work better in this situation by actively projecting certain light patterns to the scene to create artificial texture on the scene surface. The question we try to answer in ths paper is what would be the best pattern(s) to project. This paper introduces optimized projection patterns based on a novel concept of (symmetric) non-recurring De Bruijn sequences, and describes algorithms to generate such sequences. A projected pattern creates an artificial texture which does not contain any duplicate patterns over epipolar lines within certain range, thus it makes the correspondence match simple and unique. The proposed patterns are compatible with most existing stereo algorithms, meaning that they can be used without any changes in the stereo algorithm and one can immediately get much denser depth estimates without any additional computational cost. It is also argued that the proposed patterns are optimal binary patterns, and finally a few experimental result using stereo and space-time stereo algorithms are presented.",

        "abstract": "Utilizing micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) techniques and a solvent-assisted bonding process, a new generation of diffuser peristaltic polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) micropumps was optimized and fabricated. The main purpose of this study is to compare the performance of optimized and un-optimized micopump which have the same diffuser throat/inlet area (i.e. 16000 mum2). Furthermore, an additional optimized design which has smaller diffuser inlet area was considered to validate and analyze the effect of diffuser inlet area to the micropump performance. The experimental results were validated by comparing with previous generation which had not been optimized the diffuser element. Specifically, the experimental results showed that, with similar diffuser element inlet area (i.e. 160000 mum2), with and without optimized micropumps yield maximum flow rates of 246.4 muL/min and 194.8 muL/min, respectively. Furthermore, it is shown that the back pressure in the optimized micropump is 6.9 kPa, while that in the un-optimized pump is 5.69 kPa. The effect of diffuser element throat/inlet area to pump flow rate and back pressure was investigated by comparing the experimental results of two optimized designs, one with 80 mum times 80 mum and the other with 127 mum times 127 mum cross-sectional area. The results indicated that, the design with larger inlet area gave higher flow rate. However, the rate of reduction in the maximum flow rate with increasing back-pressure increases at the higher inlet area design, which is due to the greater pressure dissipation/loss associated with a larger channel cross-sectional area.",

In this article new arguments are suggested to show how different homoclinic curves can be preplanned for dynamics of the passive-link of the robot. This is done by reparameterizing the motion according to geometrical relations among the generalized coordinates. It is also shown that under certain conditions there exist periodic solutions surrounding such homoclinic orbits. These trajectories admit designing feedback controllers to ensure exponential orbital stabilization. The method is illustrated by simulations and supported by experimental studies.",

Using a new MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) microgripper, this technique employs a controllable plunging mechanism for the micro object to gain sufficient momentum to overcome adhesion forces. Experimental results also confirmed that this technique is not substrate dependent. Theoretical analyses were conducted to understand the release principle. Based on this preliminary study, the technique may also prove to be an effective solution to active release of sub-micron objects in robotic pick-place.",

The robot dynamics is modeled as an autonomous system of a three-dimensional inverted pendulum by applying the PDAC concept that is based on the assumption of point contact of the robot foot and the virtual constraint as to robot joints. Due to autonomy, there are two conservative quantities named ldquoPDAC constantrdquo, that determine the velocity and direction of the biped walking. We also propose the convergence algorithm to make PDAC constant converge to arbitrary value, so that walking velocity and direction is controllable. Numerical simulation results validate proposed algorithm.",

The parking task is defined by a reference image taken at the target location. The proposed control law is based on the essential matrix, but unlike traditional methods, it is not used to compute pose parameters. Instead, the control law is defined directly in terms of individual entries of the essential matrix by means of the input-output linearization of the system. Here we solve the problem of degeneracies due to short baseline by taking advantage of the planar motion constraint of the robot. Thus, a virtual target is defined providing a stable estimation of the essential matrix without degeneracies despite short baseline.",

The method is based on the passive extrapolative compression strategy proposed in the work of Kuschel et al. (2006). The innovation is that the extrapolations do not have a stiff horizon, but are triggered by considerable changes (events) in the target environment. This enables longer average extrapolation horizons and thus, higher compression. Experiments are conducted using two DLR light weight robots. The results indicate that the method outperforms older implementations.",

In passive grasping, the contact forces rely on the physical compliance of the system which is usually described by complex contact mechanics models. The purpose of this paper is to study the properties of a type of contact model, the linear elastic contact model, so that it is possible to determine the passive force closure condition and to understand the essential characteristics of the passive grasping. The formula to solve the passive grasping forces is derived. Properties of the passive grasping is studied. The kinematic compatibility equation which describes the requirement of the coordination of contact forces is discovered, which is unique to the passive grasping. The algorithm to find the range of the preload to guarantee the passive force closure is deduced. The algorithm is demonstrated with two examples.",

        "abstract": "The goal of motion planning is to find a feasible path that connects two positions and is free from collision with obstacles. Path sets are a robust approach to this problem in the face of real-world complexity and uncertainty. A path set is a collection of feasible paths and their corresponding control sequences. A path-set-based planner navigates by repeatedly testing each of these robot-fixed paths for collision with obstacles. A heuristic function selects which of the surviving paths to follow next. At each step, the robot follows a small piece of each path selected while simultaneously planning the subsequent trajectory. A path set possesses high path diversity if it performs well at obstacle-avoidance and goal-seeking behaviors. Previous work in path diversity has tacitly assumed that a correlation exists between this dynamic planning problem and a simpler, static path diversity problem: a robot placed randomly into an obstacle field evaluates its path set for collision a single time before following the chosen path in entirety. Although these problems might intuitively appear to be linked, this paper shows that static and dynamic path diversity are two distinct properties. After empirically demonstrating this fact, we discuss some of the factors that differentiate the two problems.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the path following problem of an omnidirectional mobile robot has been studied. Given the error dynamic model derived from the robot state vector and the path state vector, model predictive control (MPC) is employed to design the control law, which can deal explicitly with the rate of progression of a virtual vehicle to be followed along the path. The distinct advantage over other control strategies is that input and system constraints are able to be handled straightforwardly in the optimization problem so that the robot can travel safely with a high velocity. Unlike nonholonomic mobile robots, omnidirectional mobile robots, which we focus on in this paper, have simultaneously and independently controlled rotational and translational motion capabilities. Then, our purposed MPC controller was validated by experiments with a real omnidirectional mobile robot.",

        "abstract": "The reduction of the kinematics and/or dynamics of a high-DOF robotic manipulator to a low-dimension ldquotask spacerdquo has proven to be an invaluable tool for designing feedback controllers. When obstacles or other kinodynamic constraints complicate the feedback design process, motion planning techniques can often still find feasible paths, but these techniques are typically implemented in the high-dimensional configuration (or state) space. Here we argue that providing a Voronoi bias in the task space can dramatically improve the performance of randomized motion planners, while still avoiding non-trivial constraints in the configuration (or state) space. We demonstrate the potential of task-space search by planning collision-free trajectories for a 1500 link arm through obstacles to reach a desired end-effector position.",

The experimental work consists in measuring the differential thresholds of force perception applied to the hand-arm system. These findings support our claim that the human perception of forces and torques depends on force intensity and works differently along different directions, thus suggesting that perception can be enhanced by suitable scaling. We have identified a scaling function for each direction and we have shown that this variable scalings can be safely embedded in a passivity based teleoperation system in order to improve the feeling perceived by the user during the interaction with remote environments.",

The aim of this work is to evaluate those human factors most relevant to surface contact task in a bilateral teleoperation system characterized by a low stiffness environment. Three psychophysical experiments are conducted using an high performance haptic device and a virtual environment. In the first experiment we measure the capability of the human hand in terms of absolute force detection. The second experiment takes into account the time required by the neuro-muscular-skeletal system to stabilize the hand displacement in the presence of an external force. In the third one, a task of surface detection is involved to measures the smallest penetration depth that can be used to reliably perceive the contact surface. These perceptual factors are evaluated to build a perceptual model of a surface detection task. Results show the effectiveness of our model, which can be useful in applications where it is crucial to be aware of the interplay among perceptual factors.",

        "abstract": "Visual servoing consists of positioning a robot end-effector based on the matching of some object features in the image. However, due to the presence of image noise, this matching can never be ensured, hence introducing an error on the final location of the robot. This paper addresses the problem of estimating the worst-case location error introduced by image points matching. In particular, we propose some strategies for computing upper bounds and lower bounds of such an error according to several possible measures for certain image noise intensity and camera-object configuration. These bounds provide an admissible region of the sought worst-case location error, and hence allow one to establish performance limitation of visual servo systems. Some examples are reported to illustrate the proposed strategies and their results.",

A simple model which captures the essential features of the system is used to compute the reference trajectory as the solution of an optimal control problem. Based on a lifted domain description of that same model an iterative learning controller is synthesized by solving a linear least-squares problem. The non-causality of the approach makes it possible to anticipate recurring disturbances. Computational requirements are modest, allowing controller update in real-time. The experience gained from successful maneuvers can be used to significantly reduce transients when performing similar motions. The algorithm is successfully applied to a real quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle. The results are presented and discussed.",

Using this feature, the teacher can perform a procedure in the haptic simulator and record her actions. The trainee is then able to observe the recorded procedure and follow the correct trajectory in the position and force. Several haptic playback techniques are reviewed and the procedure implemented in the simulator is described in detail.

Various person recognition systems have been proposed so far, and one of the recently introduced human characteristics for the person identification is gait. Although the shape of one's body has not been considered much as a characteristic, it is closely related to gait and it is difficult to disassociate them. So, the proposed technique introduces a new hybrid biometric, combining body shape (physiological) and gait (behavioral). The new biometric is the full spatio-temporal volume carved by a person who walks. In addition to this biometric, we extract unique biometrics in individuals by the following way: creating the average image from the spatio-temporal volume and forming the new spatio-temporal volume from differential images which are created by subtracting an average image from original images. Affine moment invariants are derived from these biometrics, and classified by a support vector machine. We used the leave-one-out cross validation technique to estimate the correct classification rate of 94 %.",

To do that, we use as visual features the luminance of all pixels in the image as we did in our previous work [4]. An important issue of this approach is that it does not rely at all on a any matching nor tracking process, contrary to all the approaches based on geometric visual features (points, straight lines, pose, homography, etc.). However, we consider in this paper a complete illumination model contrary to [4] where the temporal luminance constancy hypothesis was assumed. The main issue of this paper is thus the analytical computation of the interaction matrix related to the luminance from the Phong illumination model. Experimental results on specular objects validate our approach.",

Some of them exhibit rheological behaviors when they are subject to external force, such as human tissues, human organs, and food. If we want to simulate or control such behaviors, we have to know the physical parameters of the object in advance. In this paper, we propose an approach to identify these parameters based on 2D finite element (FE) simulation and measurement of deformation and force. At first, 2D FE model used to simulate rheological deformation was described. Then, identification method was presented according to the analysis of simulation results. Identification results for simulation were also given. Finally, this method was applied to a object made of clay. Deformation and force were measured by camera and tactile sensor respectively. The identification results show the validity and effectiveness of this method.",

        "abstract": "Flexible endoscopes are used in many surgical procedures and diagnostic exams. They have also been used recently for new surgical procedures using natural orifices called NOTES. While these procedures are really promising for the patients, they are really awkward for the surgeons. In order to assist the surgeon, physiological motion cancellation has been successfully applied on a robotized endoscope in L. Ott, et al., (May 19-23, 2008), by using a prototype repetitive controller (PRC) and a repetitive generalized predictive controller (R-GPC). Both controllers showed to be powerful tools to cancel periodic disturbances but with poor transient response to non-periodic disturbances. Contrary to the R-GPC, the PRC is unsuitable for handling non-periodic reference changes. We propose in this paper, as a first improvement, a model-based control scheme using the PRC which allows to decouple the reference tracking from the periodic output disturbance rejection. The response to nonperiodic disturbance is also improved by this technique but a repetition appears caused by the repetitive controller. As a second improvement, a switching control scheme is proposed to avoid the repetition.",

        "abstract": "To improve on current methods of minimally invasive surgery, research is being carried out on systems that will permit procedures to be conducted on the micro-scale using remotely operated micro-robots. One of the major stumbling blocks to meeting this need has been the absence of a practical micromotor with a volume of less than 1 mm3 with which to drive these devices. To rectify this, we present a piezoelectric ultrasonic resonant micromotor with a volume of approximately 0.75 mm3. The motor uses a novel helically cut stator that matches axial and torsional resonant frequencies, excited by a lead zirconate titanate element 0.03 mm3 in volume. An earlier motor using the same stator design, but a larger overall volume, achieved a start-up torque of 47 nNm and no load angular velocity of 830 rad/s. This performance is on the order necessary to propel a swimming microbot in small human veins.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the design, fabrication, and application of an piezoelectrically driven microgripper integrated sidewall piezoresistive force sensor for measuring the gripping force. Surface and bulk micromachining technology is employed to fabricate end-effectors and sensor of the microgripper from a single crystal silicon wafer. Vertical sidewall surface piezoresistor etching technique is used to form the side direction sensors. The end-effectors of the gripper are four-bar structures. Two fixed cantilever beams integrated with piezoresistive sensor are designed to sense the gripping force, and a piezoelectrically driven microactuator is designed to provide the force to operate the other two movable bars. The piezoelectrically driver adhered with the silicon end-effectors generates a linear horizontal motion 9 mum, which is amplified to 30 mum at the bar tip of the microgripper. Then the range of the operation is 25 mum - 140 mum. Testing results verify that the vertical sidewall surface piezoresistor etching technique is effective. The sensitivity of the piezoresistive sensors is better than 72 V/N, and the resolution is better than 3 muN.",

Robot setup planning, force feedback control and nullspace handling with three robotic arms are considered. The planning software is separated into sequentially executed planning and registration procedures. An optimal setup is first planned in virtual reality and then adapted to variations in the operating room. The real time control system is structured in hierarchical layers. Functions are arranged in the layers with respect to their domain and maximum response time. The design is flexible and expandable while performance is maintained. Structure, functionality and implementation of planning and control are described. The prototypic robotic system provides intuitive bimanual bilateral teleoperation within the planned working space.",

Robotic playmates capable of physically manipulating toys have the potential to engage children in therapeutic play and augment the beneficial interactions provided by overtaxed care givers and costly therapists. To date, assistive robots for children have almost exclusively focused on social interactions and teleoperative control. Within this paper we present progress towards the creation of robots that can engage children in manipulative play. First, we present results from a survey of popular toys for children under the age of 2 which indicates that these toys share simplified appearance properties and are designed to support a relatively small set of coarse manipulation behaviors. We then present a robotic control system that autonomously manipulates several toys by taking advantage of this consistent structure. Finally, we show results from an integrated robotic system that imitates visually observed toy playing activities and is suggestive of opportunities for robots that play with toys.",

Such estimates are typically a prerequisite for any human-aware robot navigation, which is the basis for effective and time extended interaction between a mobile robot and a human. The robot uses observed information from a laser range finder to detect persons and their position relative to the robot. This information together with the motion of the robot itself is fed through a Kalman filter, which utilizes a model of the human kinematic movement to produce an estimate of the person's pose. The resulting pose estimates are used to identify humans who wish to be approached and interacted with. The behaviour of the robot is based on adaptive potential functions adjusted accordingly such that the persons social spaces are respected. The method is tested in experiments that demonstrate the potential of the combined pose estimation and adaptive behaviour approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with a tracked robot that consists of the proposed crawler module, in which a planetary gear reducer is used as the power transmission device to give two different outputs with just one actuator. This under-actuated system could perform posture control through the interaction between the front and rear modules. On occasion, the posture that the front module is lifted up can make the robot overcome obstacles actively and easily. To find out the controllable postures, the static analysis of the robot has been conducted. In this paper, we provide the control strategy for performing the posture control, and propose the control methods including direct, indirect, and cooperative control to conduct the posture control. Experimental tests show the effectiveness of the control methods.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the posture of the manipulator that has redundant DOF similar to human upper extremity. The human arm naturally takes a posture with no wandering although it has one or two DOF redundancy. The authors consider that the posture will be determined in task-oriented, which means that human unconsciously takes a posture of his/her upper extremities, which is suitable for the task that the endpoint is about to do. This study also assumes that all joints are capable to adjust the joint stiffness so that the stiffness of the endpoint in the task space is also adjustable. Hence our study aims to establish the theoretical method to make the manipulator take a posture that provides a stiffness of the endpoint suitable for the task. The new formula for shaping the manipulator's posture to provide a desired stiffness of the endpoint is presented followed by the simulation study to verify it.",

        "abstract": "Analysis of the power consumption of a robotic ground vehicle (RGV) is important for planning since it enables motion plans that do not violate the power limitations of the motors, energy efficient path planning, prediction of the ability to complete a task based upon the vehicle's current energy supply, and estimation of when the vehicle will need to refuel or recharge. Power modeling is particularly difficult for skid steered vehicles because of the complexities of properly taking into account the skidding that is used for vehicle turning. This paper begins with a 2-dimensional, second order differential equation of a skid steered, wheeled RGV and shows that the power model is terrain dependent and is a function of both the turning radius and linear velocity of the vehicle. This model was verified experimentally, and a comprehensive set of experiments was performed to describe the power consumption of a skid steered RGV on asphalt.",

        "abstract": "The paper presents an alternative to CNC machining, based on a proposed method for creating very large and precise replicas of prototype shapes using material-removal and/or material-adding mechanisms that need not be calibrated. The method is based upon the creation of a \u201cvirtual mold\u201d, which is created in the two-dimensional image planes of two or more stationary, uncalibrated cameras. The cameras are placed so as to view portions of the prototype surface and remain stationary while multiple-beam laser pointers cast their light toward the prototype shape and the resulting laser-spot reflections are registered and matched among the cameras. Large numbers of images can be acquired with slightly offset pan and tilt angles of laser-pointer-bearing units, resulting in collected laser-spot-centroid indications that may number in the thousands. The spot-centroid coordinates in camera space are matched in such a way that individual, physical spot-centroid indications are registered in memory in accordance with correspondence among those cameras able to view any one particular spot. This forms the basis of the \u201cvirtual mold\u201d. Subsequent reproduction of the shape, as with a CNC machine, relies upon action of a robot to remove material from a blank. This blank is placed so as to occupy the region where the prototype had been during laser spot casting. Camera-space manipulation is used to guide the robot in consecutive passes of material removal, with laser spots cast upon each newly revealed intermediate surface and reflected up into the original cameras. The paper presents the use of a FANUC M16-iB industrial robot, in order to obtain experimental evidence on how the original surface regions can be replicated with extremely high precision despite no need for calibration either of the cameras or the manipulator.",

Our model includes three approaches: (i) projection of a self-forward model for predicting phenomena in the external environment (other individuals), (ii) ldquotriadic relationrdquo that is mediation by a physical object between self and others, (iii) introduction of infant imitation by a parent. The recurrent neural network with parametric bias (RNNPB) model is used as the robot's self forward-inverse model. A group of hierarchical neural networks are attached to the RNNPB model as ldquoconversion modulesrdquo. Experiments demonstrated that a robot with our model could imitate a human's motions by translating the viewpoint. It could also discriminate known/unknown motions appropriately, and associate whole motion dynamics from only one motion snap image.",

        "abstract": "Advanced operated-work machines, which have been designed for complicated tasks and which have complicated operating systems, requires intelligent systems that can provide the quantitative work analysis needed to determine effective work procedures and that can provide operational and cognitive support for operators. Construction work environments are extremely complicated, however, and this makes state identification, which is a key technology for an intelligent system, difficult. We therefore defined primitive static states (PSS) that are determined using on-off information for the lever inputs and manipulator loads for each part of the grapple and front and that are completely independent of the various environmental conditions and variation in operator skill level that can cause an incorrect work state identification. To confirm the usefulness of PSS, we performed experiments with a demolition task by using our virtual reality simulator. We confirmed that PSS could robustly and accurately identify the work states and that untrained skills could be easily inferred from the results of PSS-based work analysis. We also confirmed in skill-training experiments that advice information based on PSS-based skill analysis greatly improved operator's work performance. We thus confirmed that PSS can adequately identify work states and are useful for work analysis and skill improvement.",

This algorithm can be summarized as a sequence of optimal resolutions for each linear system following their priority order. We propose an optimality criterion that is adapted to linear inequality systems and characterize the resulting optimal sets at every priority level. We have successfully applied our method to plan local motions for the humanoid robot HPR-2. We will demonstrate the validity of the method using an original scenario where linear inequality constraints are solved at lower priority than equality constraints.",

Sensors are described with a footprint and a false negative probability, i.e. the probability of failing to report a target within their sensing range. The model implements a probabilistic extension to our formerly developed deterministic approach for modeling surveillance tasks in large environments with large robot teams known as Graph-Clear. This extension leads to a new algorithm that allows to answer new design and performance questions, namely 1) how many robots are needed to obtain a certain confidence that the environment is free from intruders, and 2) given a certain number of robots, how should they coordinate their actions to minimize their failure rate.",

        "abstract": "Recent research has shown that robots can model their world with Multi-Level (ML) surface maps, which utilize dasiapatchespsila in a 2D grid space to represent various environment elevations within a given grid cell. Though these maps are able to produce 3D models of the environment while exploiting the computational feasibility of single elevation maps, they do not take into account in-plane uncertainty when matching measurements to grid cells or when grouping those measurements into dasiapatches.psila To respond to these drawbacks, this paper proposes to extend these ML surface maps into Probabilistic Multi-Level (PML) surface maps, which uses formal probability theory to incorporate estimation and modeling errors due to uncertainty. Measurements are probabilistically associated to cells near the nominal location, and are categorized through hypothesis testing into dasiapatchespsila via classification methods that incorporate uncertainty. Experimental results comparing the performances of the PML and ML surface mapping algorithms on representative objects found in both indoor and outdoor environments show that the PML algorithm outperforms the ML algorithm in most cases including in the presence of noisy and sparse measurements. The experimental results support the claim that the PML algorithm produces more densely populated, conservative representations of its environment with fewer measurements than the ML algorithm.",

The resulted extended strong tracking filter (ESTF) is then combined with a probabilistic multi-component evolving mechanism and finally forms the MESTer localization method. Real robot experiments and comparisons with existing methods show that MESTer has high convergence speed, computational efficiency and definite robustness to sensor noises, kidnapped robot problem, system nonlinearities, and symmetric environments.",

Dynamic objects of type ldquoneutralrdquo or ldquotargetrdquo move through a discretized environment. Probabilistic representation of the current level of situational awareness - knowledge or belief of object locations and identities - is updated with imperfect observations. Optimization of search is formulated as a mixed-integer program to maximize the expected number of targets found and solved efficiently in a receding horizon approach. The search effort is conducted in tandem with object identification and target interception tasks, and a method for assignment of these missions among agents is developed. The proposed framework is demonstrated in simulation studies, and an implementation of its decision support capabilities in a recent field experiment is reported.",

This requires dealing with temporal context, handling multiple and ambiguous interpretations, and accounting for various sources of uncertainty. In this paper we propose a probabilistic approach to modeling and recognizing situations. We define a situation as a distribution over sequences of states that have some meaningful interpretation. Each situation is characterized by an individual hidden Markov model that describes the corresponding distribution. In particular, we consider typical traffic scenarios and describe how our framework can be used to model and track different situations while they are evolving. The approach was evaluated experimentally in vehicular traffic scenarios using real and simulated data. The results show that our system is able to recognize and track multiple situation instances in parallel and make sensible decisions between competing hypotheses. Additionally, we show that our models can be used for predicting the position of the tracked vehicles.",

The haptic interface studied in this article has three degrees of freedom (3 DOF) and acts as a sword-fighting simulator. In order to obtain sharp impacts with this interface, an impact generating reel is proposed to transmit forces across the cables to a user holding the end-effector (sword). A prototype is presented in order to demonstrate the concept. As a method of quantifying the credibility of these impacts, an accelerometer was mounted on the end-effector, where the cables are attached in order to measure the vibrations caused by these impacts. These vibrations are compared with the vibrations caused by an impact with a rigid material such as steel in order to classify the stiffness of the impacts generated by the mechanism.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Recently, cognitive psychologists and others have turned their attention to the formerly neglected study of shadows, and the information they purvey. These studies show that the human perceptual system values information from shadows very highly, particularly in the perception of depth, even to the detriment of other cues. However with a few notable exceptions, computer vision systems have treated shadows not as signal but as noise. This paper makes a step towards redressing this imbalance by considering the formal representation of shadows. We take one particular aspect of reasoning about shadows, developing the idea that shadows carry information about a fragment of the viewpoint of the light source. We start from the observation that the region on which the shadow is cast is occluded by the caster with respect to the light source and build a qualitative theory about shadows using a region-based spatial formalism about occlusion. Using this spatial formalism and a machine vision system we are able to draw simple conclusions about domain objects and egolocation for a mobile robot.",

        "abstract": "The emerging field of medical robotics is aiming in introducing intelligent tools to perform medical procedures. In particular, robotic researchers have been proposed advanced medical training systems to enhance motor dexterities of trainees. An efficient medical training system should be designed to simulate real-world conditions and to assure their effectiveness as the representation of the motor skills often differs among trainees. Up to now, several training simulators have been developed by medical companies designed to reproduce with high fidelity the human body. However, such devices are not designed to provide any information to trainees. Therefore, we have proposed the development of a patient robot which embeds sensors and actuators into a conventional human model. Due to its complexity, as a first approach; we are presenting the development of a suture training system designed to simulate the real-world task conditions as well as providing quantitative assessments. In particular; the Waseda-Kyotokagaku Suture No.2 Refined II is presented, which includes a new evaluation function to provide more detailed information of the task. A set of experiments were proposed to analyze the performance of trainees. From the experimental results, we could confirm its effectiveness to detect differences of the performance of trainees.",

The method exploits the anisotropy of the antenna gain to determine the bearing of the robot relative to reference radio nodes. This method is not only more precise than the mapping of the RSSI to distance only, it also allows to estimate the orientation of the robot and to monitor the integrity of the measurement. The integrity measure is also incorporated into the RSSI to distance mapping and a thorough error analysis is presented. The paper describes the localization concept and presents experimental results for mobile robot localization in an outdoor environment. The achieved accuracy is significantly increased compared to previously developed RSSI based localization methods.",

The objective of the trajectory-generation algorithm is to optimise a cost function out to a limited time horizon. The space of control trajectories is searched by expanding a tree using randomised sampling, in a manner similar to an RRT. The algorithm is improved by seeding the tree using the best control trajectory from the previous iteration, and by pruning branches based on a bound to the cost function and the best trajectory found so far. Performance of the algorithm is analysed in simulation. In addition, the algorithm has been implemented on two kinds of vehicles: the Segway RMP and a four-wheel-drive. The algorithm has been used to drive autonomously for a combined total on the order of hundreds of hours.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the localization of a mobile robot while simultaneously mapping the position of the nodes of a Wireless Sensor Network using only range measurements. The robot can estimate the distance to nearby nodes of the Wireless Sensor Network by measuring the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of the received radio messages. The RSSI measure is very noisy, especially in an indoor environment due to interference and reflections of the radio signals. We adopted an Extended Kalman Filter SLAM algorithm to integrate RSSI measurements from the different nodes over time, while the robot moves in the environment. A simple pre-processing filter helps in reducing the RSSI variations due to interference and reflections. Successful experiments are reported in which an average localization error less than 1 m is obtained when the SLAM algorithm has no a priori knowledge on the wireless node positions, while a localization error less than 0.5 m can be achieved when the position of the node is initialized close to the their actual position. These results are obtained using a generic path loss model for the transmission channel. Moreover, no internode communication is necessary in the WSN. This can save energy and enables to apply the proposed system also to fully disconnected networks.",

This robot, the RiSE V3 climbing machine-mass 5.4 kg, length 70 cm, excluding a 28 cm tail appendage-includes several novel mechanical features, including novel linkage designs for its legs and a non-backdrivable, energy-dense power transmission to enable high-speed climbing. We summarize the robot's design and document a climbing behavior that achieves rapid ascent of a wooden telephone pole at 21 cm/s, a speed previously unachieved-and, we believe, heretofore impossible-with a robot of this scale. The behavioral gait of the robot employs the mechanical design to propel the body forward while passively maintaining yaw, pitch, and roll stability during climbing locomotion. The robot's general-purpose legged design coupled with its specialized ability to quickly gain elevation and park at a vertical station silently with minimal energy consumption suggest potential applications including search and surveillance operations as well as ad hoc networking.",

The field of nonlinear \"rational\" systems is first shown to constitute a sound and versatile framework to the problem. The fundamentals of a solution based on Lyapunov theory are overviewed next, together with the noteworthy difficulties raised by robotics.

Obstacle fields with tunnels, or tubes are notoriously difficult, as are systems with differential constraints, because the tree grows inefficiently at the boundaries. Here we present a new sampling strategy for the RRT algorithm, based on an estimated feasibility set, which affords a dramatic improvement in performance in these severely constrained systems. We demonstrate the algorithm with a detailed look at the expansion of an RRT in a swing up task, and on path planning for a nonholonomic car.",

        "abstract": "Scan matching, the problem of registering two laser scans in order to determine the relative positions from which the scans were obtained, is one of the most heavily relied-upon tools for mobile robots. Current algorithms, in a trade-off for computational performance, employ heuristics in order to quickly compute an answer. Of course, these heuristics are imperfect: existing methods can produce poor results, particularly when the prior is weak. The computational power available to modern robots warrants a re-examination of these quality vs. complexity trade-offs. In this paper, we advocate a probabilistically-motivated scan-matching algorithm that produces higher quality and more robust results at the cost of additional computation time. We describe several novel implementations of this approach that achieve real-time performance on modern hardware, including a multi-resolution approach for conventional CPUs, and a parallel approach for graphics processing units (GPUs). We also provide an empirical evaluation of our methods and several contemporary methods, illustrating the benefits of our approach. The robustness of the methods make them especially useful for global loop-closing.",

        "abstract": "Tracking the pose of human face has long been an important research topic which has many important applications, and it is particularly challenging with a monocular camera because the depth information is lost due to the perspective projection. This work adopts particle filter with partitioned sampling to decompose the state space of face pose tracking into two subspaces for increasing the sampling efficiency, thus achieving satisfactory performance with fewer particles. The parameters in the first subspace describe the target on image plane, and the parameter in the second subspace is used for the estimate of the face pose in yaw angle direction. For the evaluation of each hypothesis in the second subspace, a statistical learning algorithm called relevance vector machine (RVM) is used to map a face containing image to the pose of the face. The training of RVM is tailored to each detected frontal face, and it takes less than half second, which is suitable for a real-time application. The learning based regression model also presents the insensitive ability to expression variation and unmodeled degree of freedom. The experimental results verify that the combination of particle filter and RVM can efficiently reduce the processing time and add robustness to the performance of the system, thus making this algorithm applicable to human-machine interface with low-cost webcams.",

It is exclusively based on the visual information provided by both a low-cost wide-angle stereo camera and a low-cost GPS. Our approach divides the whole map into local sub-maps identified by the so-called fingerprint (reference poses). At the sub-map level (low level SLAM), 3D sequential mapping of natural landmarks and the vehicle location/orientation are obtained using a top-down Bayesian method to model the dynamic behavior. A higher topological level (high level SLAM) based on references poses has been added to reduce the global accumulated drift, keeping real-time constraints. Using this hierarchical strategy, we keep local consistency of the metric sub-maps, by mean of the EKF, and global consistency by using the topological map and the MultiLevel Relaxation (MLR) algorithm. GPS measurements are integrated at both levels, improving global estimation. Some experimental results for different large-scale urban environments are presented, showing an almost constant processing time.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a system capable of recovering the trajectory of a vehicle from the video input of a single camera at a very high frame-rate. The overall frame-rate is limited only by the feature extraction process, as the outlier removal and the motion estimation steps take less than 1 millisecond with a normal laptop computer. The algorithm relies on a novel way of removing the outliers of the feature matching process.We show that by exploiting the nonholonomic constraints of wheeled vehicles it is possible to use a restrictive motion model which allows us to parameterize the motion with only 1 feature correspondence. Using a single feature correspondence for motion estimation is the lowest model parameterization possible and results in the most efficient algorithms for removing outliers. Here we present two methods for outlier removal. One based on RANSAC and the other one based on histogram voting. We demonstrate the approach using an omnidirectional camera placed on a vehicle during a peak time tour in the city of Zurich. We show that the proposed algorithm is able to cope with the large amount of clutter of the city (other moving cars, buses, trams, pedestrians, sudden stops of the vehicle, etc.). Using the proposed approach, we cover one of the longest trajectories ever reported in real-time from a single omnidirectional camera and in cluttered urban scenes, up to 3 kilometers.",

Tiji is geared towards complex dynamic systems subject to differential constraints, such as wheeled vehicles, and its efficiency warrants it can be used in real-time. Above all, Tiji is able to compute a trajectory that reaches the goal state at a prescribed final time in order to avoid collision with the moving objects of the environment. The method proposed, which relies upon a parametric trajectory representation, is variational in nature. The trajectory parameters are incrementally updated in order to optimize of a cost function involving the distance between the end of the trajectory computed and the (goal state, final time) pair. Should the goal state be unreachable (if the final time is ill-chosen), the method returns a trajectory that ends as close as possible to the (goal state, final time) pair, which can be useful in certain applications.",

        "abstract": "Distance measurement using an ultrasonic wave is suitable for environment recognition in autonomous mobile robots. Ultrasonic distance measurement with the pulse-echo method is based on determining the time-of-flight (TOF) of the reflected echoes. The pulse-echo method with pulse compression, the cross-correlation method, can improve the distance resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the reflected echo. However, cross correlation of the cross-correlation method requires the high-cost digital signal processing. A sensor signal processing method of cross correlation using a delta-sigma modulated single-bit digital signal has been proposed. Cross correlation by single-bit signal processing reduces the calculation cost of cross correlation. Furthermore, cross correlation by single-bit signal processing improves the time resolution of digital signal processing. In this paper, the distance resolution of cross correlation by single-bit signal processing is evaluated by computer simulations and experiments of ultrasonic distance measurement. Distance measurement from the high-time-resolution cross-correlation function obtained by single-bit signal processing realized high distance resolution from experimental results, despite the low calculation costs.",

Whereas robots can plan their paths more effectively when they utilize the information about the deformability of objects, they also need to consider the influence of the interaction with the deformable objects on their measurements during the execution of their navigation task. In this paper, we present a probabilistic approach to identify the measurements influenced by the deformable objects. Based on a learned statistics about the influence of the deformable objects on the measurements, the robot is able to perform a sensor-based collision avoidance of unforeseen objects. We present experiments carried out with a real robot that illustrate the practicability of our approach.",

We are developing one of the unmanned bike robot systems with a balancer and it can do a wheelie and move to track the path in the ground plane. In this paper, we propose a control strategy to perform an acrobatic turn with wheelie motion, which can be quick and require minimum contact space for a bicycle by using nonlinear control based on the output-zeroing controller. The dynamic models of the bicycle with the balancer are derived from Lagrangian's equations and they are combined by Lagrange's multiplier according to nonholonomic and holonomic constraints between subsystems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by several numerical simulations using a detail model of a bicycle.",

Navigation systems using artificial pheromones have not been extensively developed. Therefore, this paper presents a model for realizing an artificial pheromone system by using data carriers and autonomous robots. By introducing an artificial pheromone system composed of data carriers and autonomous robots, a robotics system creates a potential field for navigation. First, we develop pheromone density in a discrete nominal model. Then, we extend the model to deal with a random layout that is suitable for real conditions of data carriers. For demonstration of the effectiveness of our proposed model, computer simulations and hardware implementations are performed. The artificial pheromone potential field constructed using our proposed model can be used for the navigation of autonomous robots.",

This paper presents an algorithm for realtime segmentation of a continuous stream of incoming range data. The method is an extension of the previously developed RBNN algorithm and proceeds in two phases: Firstly, the normal vector of each incoming point is estimated from its neighborhood, which is continuously monitored. Secondly, new points are clustered according to their Euclidean and angular distance to previously clustered points. An outline of the algorithm complexity as well as the parameters that influence the segmentation performance is provided. Three benchmark scenarios in which the algorithm is deployed on a mobile robot with a laser range finder confirm that the method can robustly segment incoming data at high rates.",

We adopt pivoting manipulation for the humanoid robot to move a bulky object without lifting in a stable and dexterous manner. In order to carry the object to a desired place, the humanoid should sometimes move through narrow areas surrounded by obstacles. We propose a roadmap multiplexing planning to allow the robot to leave the object near narrow places and to regrasp it from another position to continue carrying. We utilize visibility probabilistic roadmap (PRM) method as a preprocessing to capture the critical configurations for regrasping. Then a diffusion method is employed to plan the overall manipulation path including regrasping. The proposed method is verified through planning simulation including whole-body motions.",

        "abstract": "Relative bearing between robots is important in applications like pursuit-evasion [11] and SLAM [7]. This is also true in sensor networks, where the bearing of one sensor node relative to another has been used for localization [5], [18], [20] and topology control [14], [21], [6]. Most systems use dedicated sensors like an IR array or a camera to obtain relative bearing. We study the use of radio signal strength (RSS) in commodity radios for obtaining relative bearing. We show that by using the robot's mobility, commodity radios can be used to obtain coarse relative bearing. This measurement can be used for a suite of applications that do not require very precise bearing measurement. We analyze signal strength variations in simulation and experiment and also show an algorithm that uses this coarse bearing computation in a practical setting.",

        "abstract": "A reliable control method is proposed for multiple loop control systems. If a feedback loop fails (e.g., as a result of a sensor breakdown), the control system develops an unstable fluctuation. To cope with this problem, the proposed method uses an equivalent transfer function (ETF) for active redundancy compensation after loop failure. The ETF is used to maintain the transfer function of the entire system the same before and after loop failure. In this study, the characteristics of a reliable control system that uses an ETF were examined experimentally. A position servo system including a disturbance observer is used in the experiment. In case of feedback loop failure, the control system could not be stabilized using the disturbance observer alone; however, the ETF stabilized the control system after feedback loop failure.",

We address the problem of defining such sets and to find simple tests to verify if an orientation lies within a given set. The unit quaternion is used to represent the orientation of the rigid body and we develop three different sets of orientations that can easily be described by simple constraints in quaternion space. The three sets discussed can also be described as convex cones in Ropf3 defined by different norms. By describing the sets as convex cones and using certain properties of dual cones, we are able find simpler representations for the set of orientations and computationally faster and more accurate tests to verify if a quaternion lies within the given set.",

The proposed controller achieves trajectory tracking while optimizing stiffness of elastic elements installed in each joint of the robots. Even though the multi-joint robots have nonlinear dynamics and multi degree-of-freedom, the stiffness optimization realizes high energy efficiency as if we utilized resonance. An advantage of the proposed control is to work well without using exact parameter values of the robots. Since it seems that adaptive control and iterative learning control have not been used simultaneously, this paper newly proposes a methodology to appropriately combine stiffness adaptation and iterative learning control. This combination enables trajectory tracking and convergence of the stiffness to the optimal one. These properties can not be achieved by our previous controllers.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we utilize a recently studied more accurate range noise model for 3D sensors to derive from scratch the expressions for the optimum plane which best fits a point-cloud and for the combined covariance matrix of the plane's parameters. The parameters in question are the plane's normal and its distance to the origin. The range standard-deviation model used by us is a quadratic function of the true range and is a function of the incidence angle as well. We show that for this model, the maximum-likelihood plane is biased, whereas the least-squares plane is not. The plane-parameters' covariance matrix for the least-squares plane is shown to possess a number of desirable properties, e.g., the optimal solution forms its null-space and its components are functions of easily understood terms like the planar-patch's center and scatter. We verify our covariance expression with that obtained by the eigenvector perturbation method. We further compare our method to that of renormalization with respect to the theoretically best covariance matrix in simulation. The application of our approach to real-time range-image registration and plane fusion is shown by an example using a commercially available 3D range sensor. Results show that our method has good accuracy, is fast to compute, and is easy to interpret intuitively.",

The mobile robotics scientific community makes use of Linux based OSs to avoid the lack of stability that affects Microsoft OSs, especially when real time conditions must be satisfied. In this paper we present the Linux distribution RoboBuntu, acronym formed by the union of ROBOt and uBUNTU, to overcome the almost totally independent robotic software platforms existing today. The key idea behind RoboBuntu is the integration of different tools for mobile robotics into an embedded Ubuntu distribution. Another important characteristics of RoboBuntu is that every ldquohard steprdquo, like installation and configuration of OS and tools, is hidden to common users. In particular, RoboBuntu can be used either by students or researchers, as LiveCd, permanent installation on standard hard drive or, more interesting, on a USB storage flash disk.",

        "abstract": "Ball dribbling is a central element of basketball and a main challenge for creating basketball robots is to achieve stability of the periodic dribbling task. In this paper two control designs for ball dribbling with an industrial robot are compared. For the two strategies, the ball position is determined either through force/torque or visual sensor feedback and the ball trajectory is predicted with a recursive least squares algorithm. The end effector trajectory for each dribbling cycle is generated based on the predicted ball position/velocity at the dribbling height and the estimated coefficient of restitution. For both tracking approaches, dribbling for multiple cycles is achieved. The vision-based approach performs better as compared to the force/torque-based approach, in particular for imprecise estimates of the coefficient of restitution.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In order to perform activities of daily living (ADL), a person with an amputation(s) must use a greater than normal range of movement from other anatomical body joints to compensate for the loss of movement caused by the amputation, this is called compensatory motion. By studying the compensatory motion of prosthetic users the mechanics of how they adapt to the loss of range of motion in a given limb for can be analyzed for select tasks. The purpose of this study is to create a robotic based kinematic model that can simulate the compensatory motion of a given task using given subject data. This paper reviews the use of the model to simulate compensatory motion of a transradial amputee performing two bilateral tasks: turning a steering wheel, and lifting a box. The simulation operates by changing a set of prosthetic configurations that are represented by parameters that consist of the joint degrees of freedom (DoF) provided by each prosthesis in the set. The task information is inputted into the model by defining a trajectory which the hand or prosthesis must follow to perform the task. The inclusion of the ability to model bilateral tasks is accomplished by giving control of the proximal joints to the prosthetic side. Analysis of tasks is completed by running the simulation with prosthetic and anatomical constraints attached to the left arm of the model, the right arm maintains an anatomical configuration. By running the model through this simulation the compensatory motions can be determined. Results obtained from the model can be used to select the best prosthesis for a given user, design prostheses that are more effective at selected tasks, further analyze previous studies, or to determine areas of interest for further human study.",

        "abstract": "Ice has long been used by humankind for utilitarian purposes, and more recently for artistic and entertainment purposes. Nowadays, the field of ice construction is becoming more commercially relevant, with increased interest in ice modeling at the small scale, and in ice tourism, specifically ice hotels at the large scale. As a result, there is a market for automating ice construction, and building detailed structures that would otherwise require a significant amount of manual work. To address this demand, the authors are currently developing experimental robotic systems for building ice structures: the Fab@home, for building small-scale structures, and the Adept Cobra 600 robot, for building medium-scale structures. Further software and hardware development is needed for the Cobra, since it was not designed for rapid prototyping, and certainly not for rapid prototyping using ice as the working material. The authors have designed and built fluid delivery systems for each machine to permit the use of water as the building material. A signal-processing subsystem permits control of the water-delivery flow rate and synchronization with the robot motion. Additionally, we have developed a slicing algorithm to generate toolpaths for the Cobra using stereolithography (STL) files as the input. We also intend to develop a larger robotic system for producing ice sculptures and buildings at the architectural scale.",

In such applications, control algorithms of exoskeletons are often inspired by nature for natural and effective assistance for patients. In this paper, a control algorithm is inspired by aquatic therapy. Aquatic therapy has various benefits for rehabilitation processes based on useful properties of water, e.g. buoyancy and drag. However, realization of such effects is challenged by limitations in hardware, such as mechanical impedance or impreciseness of actuator forces. Therefore, the resistive forces generated by actuators, which cause serious discomfort to patients, are precisely modeled and compensated to realize the control algorithm inspired by aquatic therapy effectively.

The dynamics of the Stewart platform driven by the linear voice coil motors is developed with the Newton-Euler method. By fully considering the characteristics of vibration isolation, the properties of the dynamics of the Stewart platform are applied to transform the coupled dynamics into six independent single-input single-output (SISO) channels. Furthermore, in the procedure of controller design, the influence factors of vibration isolation are taken into account, such as the parameter perturbation and the unmodeled dynamics, etc. Meanwhile, high-gain design method is employed to deal with the problem introduced by input unmodeled dynamics of the system. It is demonstrated that a sufficiently small L2 gain from disturbance to output can be obtained in Lyapunov synthesis. The simulation results show that the controller can effectively attenuate low frequency vibrations in six degrees of freedom (DOFs) and a satisfactory vibration isolation performance can be achieved.",

In range image preprocessing stage, the method enhances object edges by using surface normal information; and it employs the Hough Transform to detect straight line features in the Normal-Enhanced Range Image (NERI). Due to the noise in the sensor's range data, a NERI contains corrupted object surfaces that may result in unwanted edges and greatly encumber the extraction of linear features.

        "abstract": "The present paper proposes the motion planning based on \u201cthe dynamics shaping\u201d for a robotic arm to hit the target robustly toward the desired direction, of which the concept is to shape the robot dynamics appropriately in order to accomplish the desired motion. According to the linear system theory, the positional error of the end-point converges onto near the singular vector corresponding to its maximum singular value of the output controllability matrix of the robotic arm. Therefore, if we can control the direction of the singular vector by applying the dynamics shaping, we will be able to control the direction of the positional error of the end-effector caused by the disturbance. We propose a novel motion planning based on the dynamics shaping and verify numerically and experimentally that the robotic arm can robustly hit the target toward the desired direction with a simple open-loop control system even though the disturbance is applied.",

        "abstract": "We present an application of machine learning to the semi-automatic synthesis of robust servo-trackers for underwater robotics. In particular, we investigate an approach based on the use of Boosting for robust visual tracking of color objects in an underwater environment. To this end, we use AdaBoost, the most common variant of the Boosting algorithm, to select a number of low-complexity but moderately accurate color feature trackers and we combine their outputs. The novelty of our approach lies in the design of this family of weak trackers, which enhances a straightforward color segmentation tracker in multiple ways. From a large and diverse family of possible filters, we select a small subset that optimizes the performance of our trackers. The tracking process applies these trackers on the input video frames, and the final tracker output is chosen based on the weights of the final array of trackers. By using computationally inexpensive, but somewhat accurate trackers as members of the ensemble, the system is able to run at quasi real-time, and thus, is deployable on-board our underwater robot. We present quantitative cross-validation results of our spatio-chromatic visual tracker, and conclude by pointing out some difficulties faced and subsequent shortcomings in the experiments we performed, along with directions of future research in the area of ensemble tracking in real-time.",

        "abstract": "There has been an increasing interest in a kind of underactuated mechanical systems, mobile wheeled inverted pendulum (MWIP) models, which are widely used in the field of autonomous robotics and intelligent vehicles. Robust velocity tracking problem of MWIP systems is investigated in this study. In the velocity control problem, model uncertainties accompany uncertain equilibriums, which make the controller design become more difficult. A sliding mode control (SMC) method based on a novel sliding surface is proposed for the systems, which are capable of handling both parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. By assuming the specially designed sliding surface, the proposed SMC controller is capable of eliminating the steady velocity tracking error. The asymptotical stability of the closed-loop system is achieved through selecting sliding surface parameters in terms of some rules. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is finally confirmed by numerical simulations.",

This paper presents design principles for our modular robots, called Roombots, as future building blocks for furniture that moves and self-reconfigures. The reconfiguration is done using dynamic connection and disconnection of modules and rotations of the degrees of freedom. We are furthermore interested in applying Roombots towards adaptive behaviour, such as online learning of locomotion patterns. To create coordinated and efficient gait patterns, we use a Central Pattern Generator (CPG) approach, which can easily be optimized by any gradient-free optimization algorithm. To provide a hardware framework we present the mechanical design of the Roombots modules and an active connection mechanism based on physical latches. Further we discuss the application of our Roombots modules as pieces of a homogenic or heterogenic mix of building blocks for static structures.",

        "abstract": "A new method for bipedal walking on rough terrain by using ZMP criteria map is proposed. The rough terrain walking is classified to \u201cstep up\u201d and \u201cstep down\u201d by landing timing of a swing leg. The walking pattern is modified in real-time according to the difference between the ideal timing and the measured timing by a force sensor on the foot. In the case of \u201cstep up\u201d, the landing timing is faster than the ideal, and the swing leg trajectory should be change to follow the step so that the ZMP based balance of the sudden caused double support phase is kept. In the case of \u201cstep down\u201d, the landing timing is later than the ideal, and the swing leg trajectory should be change to seek the ground so that the balance of the unknown future double support phase is kept. The modified walking pattern is decided based on the ZMP criteria map. The ZMP criteria map can indicate a safe landing timing and landing position of a swing leg. By referring the ZMP criteria map, the robust walking pattern can be planned. The proposed method is implemented to HRP-2, and the effectiveness is confirmed through experiments.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a framework for synchronization based control (SBC) using neural oscillators for motion assist. A neural oscillator is used to accomplish synchronization and entrainment between periodic motions by the human and robot. The mutual joint torque between the human and robot is used as an external input signal for the neural oscillator, which generates the desired trajectory of a robot joint angle, so that the robot motion synchronizes with the external mutual joint torque. The validity and feasibility of the proposed method is examined from three points of view. The first is whether synchronization of action between human and robot can be realized. The second is whether the assist effect can be obtained, and the third is whether the proposed method has an acceptable level of usability for the user. We explored those three points of view by conducting computer simulations on a human-motion assist system and experiments with a joint torque sensing robot suit.",

However, the majority of the proposed techniques for SLAM rely on the use of accurate and dense measurements provided by laser rangefinders to correctly localize the robot and produce accurate and detailed maps of complex environments. Little work has been done on the use of low-cost but noisy and sparse sonar sensors for SLAM in large indoor environments involving large loops. In this paper, we present our approach to SLAM with sonar sensors by applying particle filtering and a line-segment-based map representation with an orthogonality assumption to map indoor environments much larger and more challenging than those previously considered with sonar sensors. Results from robotic experiments demonstrate that it is possible to produce good maps of large indoor environments with large loops despite the inherent limitations of sonar sensors.",

        "abstract": "Although fall is a rare event in the life of a humanoid robot, we must be prepared for it because its consequences are serious. In this paper we present a fall strategy which rapidly modifies the robot's fall direction in order to avoid hitting a person or an object in the vicinity. Our approach is based on the key observation that during \u201ctoppling\u201d the rotational motion of a robot necessarily occurs at the leading edge or the leading corner of its support base polygon. To modify the fall direction the robot needs to change the position and orientation of this edge or corner vis-a-vis the prohibited direction. We achieve it through intelligent stepping as soon as a fall is detected. We compute the optimal stepping location which results in the safest fall. Additional improvement to the fall controller is achieved through inertia shaping techniques aimed at controlling the centroidal inertia of the robot. We demonstrate our results through the simulation of an Asimo-like humanoid robot. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a controller that attempts to change the fall direction of a humanoid robot.",

Different approaches have been proposed so far. Some require the localisation of each vehicle and a communication infrastructure, others called near-to-near approach only needs vehicle on-board sensors. However, to our knowledge, they do not provide any proof of non collision. We propose a novel near-to-near longitudinal platooning building a collision-free platooning whatever the number of vehicles. The model is derived from the study of the most dangerous interaction between two vehicles, i.e. considering the maximum acceptable acceleration when the previous vehicles brakes at maximum capacity. Collision avoidance of this model is proved. Finally, we show that this model can be combined to existing ones, keeping this collision-free property while allowing more various behaviors.",

        "abstract": "Motion databasing is an important topic in robotics research. Humanoid robots have a large number of degrees of freedom and their motions have to satisfy a set of constraints (balance, maximal joint torque velocity and angle values). Thus motion planning cannot efficiently be done on-line. The computation of optimal motions is performed off-line to create databases that transform the problem of large computation time into a problem of large memory space. Motion planning can be seen as a Semi-Infinite Programming problem (SIP) since it involves a finite number of variables over an infinite set of constraints. Most methods solve the SIP problem by transforming it into a finite programming one using a discretization over a prescribed grid. We show that this approach is risky because it can lead to motions which may violate one or several constraints. Then we introduce our new method for planning safe motions. It uses Interval Analysis techniques in order to achieve a safe discretization of the constraints. We show how to implement this method and use it with state-of-the-art constrained optimization packages. Then, we illustrate its capabilities for planning safe motions dedicated to the HOAP-3 humanoid robot.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Collision safety between humans and robots has drawn much attention since service robots are increasingly being used in human environments. A safe robot arm based on passive compliance can usually provide faster and more reliable responses for dynamic collision than an active one involving sensors and actuators. Since both positioning accuracy and collision safety of the robot arm are equally important, a robot arm should have very low stiffness when subjected to a collision force greater than the injury tolerance, but should otherwise maintain very high stiffness. To implement these requirements, a novel safe joint mechanism (SJM-II) which has much smaller size and lighter weight than the previous model, is proposed in this research. The SJM-II has the advantage of nonlinear spring which is achieved using only passive mechanical elements such as linear springs and a double-slider mechanism. Various analyses and experiments on static and dynamic collisions show that stiffness of the SJM-II is kept very high against an external torque less than the predetermined threshold torque, but abruptly drops when the input torque exceeds this threshold, thereby guaranteeing positioning accuracy and collision safety. Furthermore, a robot arm with two SJM-IIs is verified to achieve collision safety in 2D space.",

        "abstract": "For physical human-robot interaction, safety and dependability are of utmost importance due to the potential risk a relatively powerful robot poses for human beings. From the control standpoint, it is possible to increase this level of safety by guaranteeing that the robot will never exhibit any unstable behaviour. However, stability is not the only concern in the design of a controller for such a robot. During human-robot interaction, the resulting cooperative motion should be truly intuitive and should not restrict in any way the human performance. For this purpose, we have designed a new variable admittance control law that guarantees the stability of the robot during constrained motion and also provides a very intuitive human interaction. The first characteristic is provided by the design of a stability observer while the other is based on a variable admittance control scheme that uses the force derivative as a way to predict human intention. The stability observer is based on a previous stability investigation of cooperative motion which implies the knowledge of the interaction stiffness. A method to accurately estimate this stiffness online using the data coming from the encoder and from a multi-axis force sensor at the end effector is also provided. The stability and intuitivity of the control law were verified in a user study during a cooperative drawing task with a 3 degree-of-freedom (dof) parallel robot.",

        "abstract": "One of the key factors that affect the success and efficiency of sampling-based path planners is the obtention of samples in the more relevant regions of the workspace. This is known as importance sampling, and different approaches have already been proposed in this direction. This paper proposes a novel method to bias sampling by means of geometric constraints that reduces the sampling space to sets of lower dimensional submanifolds. These constraints may be imposed by the kinematic structure of the actuation system, by the task specification, or provided by a human user as an intuitive way to include problem knowledge to the planner. The method has been implemented and tested on a probabilistic roadmap planner giving promising results. A variant using a deterministic sampling source is also reported.",

Given a start and goal position, we consider the problem of generating a complete joint trajectory that will result in the legged robot successfully moving from the start to the goal. We decompose the problem into two main phases: an initial global planning phase, which results in a footstep trajectory; and an execution phase, which dynamically generates a joint trajectory to best execute the footstep trajectory. We show how R* search can be employed to generate high-quality global plans in the high-dimensional space of footstep trajectories. Results show that the global plans coupled with the joint controller result in a system robust enough to deal with a variety of terrains.",

Modular robots with similar properties can potentially achieve self-adaptation tasks robustly. Inspired by this principle, we present a generalized distributed consensus framework for self-adaptation tasks in modular robotics. We demonstrate that a variety of modular robotic systems and tasks can be formulated within such a framework, including (1) an adaptive column that can adapt to external force, (2) a modular gripper that can manipulate fragile objects, and (3) a modular tetrahedral robot that can locomote towards a light source. We also show that control algorithms derived from this framework are provably correct. In real robot experiments, we demonstrate that such a control scheme is robust towards real world sensing and actuation noise. This framework can potentially be applied to a wide range of distributed robotics applications.",

Long-term experiments can be conducted for in-situ culture and analysis of cells by the semi-closed microchip. The semi-closed microchip has a bath in the middle of microchannel to allow the insertion of micropipettes into the microchip. The bath is sealed off by thin oil film to prevent the evaporation of the solution in the bath. The seal by the oil film can maintain even if micropipettes are inserted into the bath and pulled out from the bath because the oil film can fill the hole by its surface tension. The seal by the oil film was evaluated by measuring the weight of the bath after 12/24 hours. To use the semi-closed microchip for cell culture and cell analysis, the exchange of the solution in the bath was demonstrated. It was also demonstrated that the cell fixation with the thermo sensitive gel in the proposed semi-closed microchip by fabricating the ITO electrodes as heaters in the bath. Cell culture and the target cell harvesting were conducted by the semi-closed microchip. The proposed semi-closed microchip can be used for cell culture, cell analysis and cell harvesting under a microscope as the biological applications for single cell analysis.",

        "abstract": "Recent applications of robotics often demand two types of spatial awareness: 1) A fine-grained description of the robot's immediate surroundings for obstacle avoidance and planning, and 2) Knowledge of the robot's position in a large-scale global coordinate frame such as that provided by GPS. Although managing information at both of these scales is often essential to the robot's purpose, each scale has different requirements in terms of state representation and handling of uncertainty. In such a scenario, it can be tempting to pick either a body-centric coordinate frame or a globally fixed coordinate frame for all state representation. Although both choices have advantages, we show that neither is ideal for a system that must handle both global and local data. This paper describes an alternative design: a third coordinate frame that stays fixed to the local environment over short time-scales, but can vary with respect to the global frame. Careful management of uncertainty in this local coordinate frame makes it well-suited for simultaneously representing both locally and globally derived data, greatly simplifying system design and improving robustness. We describe the implementation of this coordinate frame and its properties when measuring uncertainty, and show the results of applying this approach to our 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge vehicle.",

This work proposes a framework that simultaneously localizes the mobile robot and multiple sound sources using a microphone array on the robot. First, an eigenstructure-based generalized cross correlation method for estimating time delays between microphones under multi-source environments is described. A method to compute the far field source directions as well as the speed of sound using the estimated time delays is proposed. In addition, the correctness of the sound speed estimate is utilized to eliminate spurious sources, which greatly enhances the robustness of sound source detection. The arrival angles of the detected sound sources are used as observations in a bearings-only SLAM procedure. As the source signals are not persistent and there is no identification of the signal content, data association is unknown which is solved using FastSLAM. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.",

For example, retracting an internal organ with a slender instrument is often a difficult task. To remove this limitation, we have proposed \u201cassemblable instruments\u201d, that is, parts are inserted through trocars and assembled inside the abdominal cavity to become a large instrument and we have developed assemblable hands. However they use two trocars for assembling, which require positioning and alignment of two assembled parts. This paper presents a simple three fingered hand whose function is limited to retracting. We propose a much simpler assembling method \u201csingle trocar assembling\u201d for the hand. Experimental results verify that the hand can be assembled easily and that it can withstand a force of 25N enough to rectract a pancreas.",

        "abstract": "For mobile platforms with steerable standard wheels it is necessary to precisely coordinate rotation and steering angle of their wheels. An established approach to ensure this is to represent the current state of motion in form of the Instantaneous Centre of Motion (ICM) and to derive a trajectory within this space. However, while control in the ICM space does guarantee adherence to the system's nonholonomic constraints, it does not avoid the system's singular configurations. Within this work we address the problem of singularity avoidance within the ICM space. Singularities related to the mathematical representation of the ICM are reduced by a reformulation of this representation. Furthermore, a controller based on artificial potential fields avoiding singular configurations of the robot by representing them as obstacles in the derived ICM space is designed. The resulting controller is particularized and analyzed w.r.t. the Care-O-bot 3 demonstrator.",

In such scenarios, robots must be able to maneuver in crowded spaces, partially filled with static and dynamic obstacles (such as people). Our approach produces smooth, complex maneuvers over large distances through the use of an anytime graph search algorithm applied to a novel multi-resolution state lattice, where the resolution is adapted based on both environmental characteristics and task characteristics. In addition, we present a novel approach for generating fast globally optimal trajectories in constrained spaces (i.e. rooms connected via doors and hallways). This approach exploits offline precomputation to provide extremely efficient online performance and is applicable to a wide range of both indoor and outdoor navigation scenarios. By combining an anytime, multi-resolution lattice-based search algorithm with our precomputation technique, globally optimal trajectories in up to four dimensions (2D position, heading and velocity) are obtained in real-time.",

In particular, given a queue of prioritized object delivery tasks, we wish to find a sequence of actions in real time to accomplish these tasks efficiently. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning algorithm called Smoothed Sarsa that learns a good policy for these delivery tasks by delaying the backup reinforcement step until the uncertainty in the state estimate improves. The state space is modeled by a Dynamic Bayesian Network and updated using a Region-based Particle Filter. We take advantage of the fact that only discrete (topological) representations of entity locations are needed for decision-making, to make the tracking and decision making more efficient. Our experiments show that policy search leads to faster task completion times as well as higher total reward compared to a manually crafted policy. Smoothed Sarsa learns a policy orders of magnitude faster than previous policy search algorithms. We demonstrate our results on the Player/Stage simulator and on the Pioneer robot.",

        "abstract": "Mobile robot could navigate in unknown environment autonomously with the help of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Recently, SLAM based on information matrix enjoys much popularity since it is naturally sparse. However, the computational burden related to information matrix balloons with respect to the increase of the mapped landmarks. In this paper, by considering the features of information matrix, we present a novel method which wipes off nearly half of the elements in information matrix. The errors that come from sparsification decrease apparently by loop-closure. Furthermore, the relationship between sparsification and SLAM accuracy is analyzed theoretically. A large scale simulation and experiment conducted on a real robot suggest that the technique is effective for a robot's SLAM in real-world applications.",

We show, for constant external conditions, maximum productivity can be achieved by a single species swarm with carefully chosen operational parameters.

        "abstract": "Hybrid maps combine metric and topological information for efficiently managing large-scale environments. In a feature-based mapping framework, this paper describes the application of a spectral clustering approach for automatically detecting the transitions between subsequently traversed local maps. Contrary to recently proposed approaches, this algorithm considers each individual map feature as a node of a graph whose edges link two nodes if they are simultaneously observed. Thus, given a sequence of observations, an auxiliary graph is incrementally built whose edges carry non-negative weights according to the locality of the features. Given a feature, its locality defines the set of features that has been observed simultaneously with it at least once. At each execution of the mapping approach, the feature-based graph is split into two subgraphs using a normalized spectral clustering algorithm. If the graph partition is validated, the algorithm determines that the robot is moving into a new area and a new local map is generated. We have tested the proposed approach in real environments where features are obtained using 2D laser sensors or vision. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the proposal.",

Due to the capability of robot motor, a robot may not be able to perform skills to satisfy both task spatial and temporal constraints. To determine the robot motor capability, this paper formulates the skill for accomplishing a task as an optimization problem subject to the spatial and temporal conditions of the task, and proposes to develop a speed-accuracy constraint suitable for the optimization problem. The proposed speed-accuracy constraint is derived from the kinematics, dynamics, and control of a robot motor system. By solving the optimization problem, a robot can perform the skill to achieve a task by its fastest speed without violating the spatial and temporal conditions of the task. Computer simulations were performed on a PUMA 560 robot to demonstrate a skill on a typical task to validate the proposed speed-accuracy optimization.",

With a common sense of feedback control, we stress that improvement of the dynamics of the sensing unit is important for a stable visual servoing. We propose a method to improve dynamics in visual recognition, with compensating the fictional motion of the target in the camera images based on kinematics of the manipulator, by extracting the real motion of the target. We named it as hand-eye motion feedforword (MFF) method. The enhanced dynamics of recognition gave further stability and precision to the total visual servoing system, evaluated by full 6-DoF servoing experiment using 7-link manipulator. The convergence time in step response was about 10[s] and precise visual servoing to a moving target object has been achieved.",

        "abstract": "It is generally accepted that locomotion in animals is based on a trade-off between energy consumption and stability. However, this trade-off is the result of the interaction between complex mechanical and control systems. To gain insight into that issue, a step-by-step approach is needed. In this study, as a first step to investigate three dimensional quadrupedal walking, we aim at establishing a control system as \u201cminimal\u201d as possible, able to realize stable dynamic walk. Using a simple mechanical structure, we realized dynamic walk with a distributed control system, made of four independent leg controllers whose swing and stance phases durations are modulated based on leg loading information. Phase modulations contribute to stabilize the posture in the frontal plane via automatic duty ratios adjustments that tend to compensate perturbations of the body rolling motion. By applying lateral perturbations, we found that the control system withstands well perturbations increasing the rolling motion amplitude, but is sensible to perturbations that suddenly decrease it, as the foreleg on the more loaded side is prevented to swing. Hence, we implemented an ascending coordination mechanism where the transition to swing in a hind leg promotes the same event in the foreleg. The duration of the subsequent foreleg swing phase is reduced to prevent excessive increase of the rolling motion amplitude. The resultant control system, although extremely simple, was able to realize dynamic walk resistant to small disturbances (lateral perturbations and terrain irregularities).",

        "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to answer (i) how the stabilization performance of a biped controller can be evaluated on a certain invariant supporting region, (ii) how the standing stabilizer which performs the best on a given supporting region can be designed, (iii) how the system can be judged if it is stabilizable by the best standing stabilizer without deforming the current supporting region, and (iv) how the supporting region should be deformed if it is judged to be necessary. In order to answer these question, the stable standing region is defined. It gives a criterion to design the best standing stabilizer, to judge if the deformation of the supporting region is necessary to stabilize the system, and to maneuver the stepping motion in accordance with the standing stabilizability condition, which is also defined in the paper. It is found that the best standing stabilizer can be designed by a simple pole-assignment technique. This framework unifies the standing stability and the stepping stability of bipedalism, which have been separately considered in conventional studies. The discussion goes on an approximate planar COM-ZMP model, in which the total mass is concentrated at the center of mass, and the position of ZMP is regarded as the input. Though it is the simplest dynamical model of bipeds, it can conceal differences of body constitutions and represent the macroscopic dynamics. Therefore, this paper contributes to not only the biped robot controller design but also the biomechanical analyses.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the linguistic model based on symbolization of motion patterns for humanoid robots. The model consists of two kinds of stochastic models : the motion language model and the natural language model. The motion language model stochastically connects the symbols of motion patterns to the morpheme words through the latent states which represent the underlying linguistic structure such as semantic contents. The natural language model represents the dynamics of the word classes. The motion language model and the natural language model correspond to semantics and syntax respectively. The integration of the motion language model and the natural language model allows robots not only to linguistically interpret the motion patterns as sentences but also to generate the motions from the sentences. The two kinds of linguistic processes of the interpretation and the generation can be obtained by solving search problems: search for a sequence of morpheme words and a symbol of motion pattern. The proposed approach to interpretation of motion patterns as sentences and generation of motion patterns from the sentences through integration of the motion language model and the natural language model is validated by the experiment on the human behavioral data.",

        "abstract": "Local linearization techniques are an important class of nonparametric system identification. Identifying local linearizations in practice involves solving a linear regression problem that is ill-posed. The problem can be ill-posed either if the dynamics of the system lie on a manifold of lower dimension than the ambient space or if there are not enough measurements of all the modes of the dynamics of the system. We describe a set of linear regression estimators that can handle data lying on a lower-dimension manifold. These estimators differ from previous estimators, because these estimators are able to improve estimator performance by exploiting the sparsity of the system - the existence of direct interconnections between only some of the states - and can work in the ldquolarge p, small nrdquo setting in which the number of states is comparable to the number of data points. We describe our system identification procedure, which consists of a pre smoothing step and a regression step, and then we apply this procedure to data taken from a quadrotor helicopter. We use this data set to compare our procedure with existing procedures.",

        "abstract": "Legged robots offer the potential to navigate highly challenging terrain, and there has recently been much progress in this area. However, a great deal of this recent work has operated under the assumption that either the robot has complete knowledge of its environment or that its environment is suitably regular so as to be navigated with only minimal perception, an unrealistic assumption in many real-world domains. In this paper we present an integrated perception and control system for a quadruped robot that allows it to perceive and traverse previously unseen, rugged terrain that includes large, irregular obstacles. A key element of the system is a novel terrain modeling algorithm, used for filling in the occluded models resulting from on-board vision systems. We apply our approach to the LittleDog robot, and show that it allows the robot to walk over challenging terrain using only on-board perception.",

        "abstract": "We present a decentralized, scalable approach to assembling a group of heterogeneous parts into different products using a swarm of robots. While the assembly plans are predetermined, the exact sequence of assembly of parts and the allocation of subassembly tasks to robots are determined by the interactions between robots in a decentralized fashion in real time. Our approach is based on developing a continuous abstraction of the system derived from models of chemical reactions and formulating the strategy as a problem of selecting rates of assembly and disassembly. These rates are mapped onto probabilities that determine stochastic control policies for individual robots, which then produce the desired aggregate behavior. This top-down approach to determining robot controllers also allows us to optimize the rates at the abstract level to achieve fast convergence to the specified target numbers of products. Because the method incorporates programs for assembly and disassembly, changes in demand can lead to reconfiguration in a seamless fashion. We illustrate the methodology using a physics-based simulator with examples involving 15 robots and two types of final products.",

In this paper, we propose a new 2-dof joint mechanism for the small ACM. A usual joint mechanism has the same number of rotational axes as that of the actuators, but the proposed mechanism has 4 rotation axes against 2 actuators. This joint mechanism has relatively large range of motion and it can improve the capability of ACM in a narrow environment. We verified the specification of the proposed mechanism and the result showed that it is suitable for the small ACM. In addition, we developed the ACM with the proposed joint mechanism, and it realized a sidewinding motion, which is a kind of snakes' locomotion style. We think this result shows that the proposed mechanism will contribute to the study of the small ACM.",

However, there are several problems in this method. 1) The end-effector must be located at the specific point where laser displacement meter can measure oscillation. 2) The adhesion state can not be checked if something blocks the light/laser or the target leaves the measuring point. 3) The total system becomes very large. To resolve these problems, this paper firstly presents a method for checking the adhesion state by piezo-transducer. Next, to achieve more precise manipulation, we propose a method to deform the end-effector by adding DC input to the piezo actuator which is also oscillated simultaneously to reduce adhesion forces. Furthermore, we find that the first mode resonance frequency shifts with the increase of the pushing force applied to the object by the end-effector. Using the shift amount, we develop a method for checking the adhesion state.",

Eight features in time and frequency domains are used for classification. Results show that for ten type of indoor and outdoor surfaces, reliable identification can be achieved (90.0 and 94.6 percent for a 1 and 4 seconds time-window, respectively), using a non-sophisticated classifier (artificial neural network). Demonstration is done on how such a sensor and a simple control strategy can be used to guide a blind robot, using a simulation and a real differential drive robot.",

        "abstract": "A points surface reconstruction algorithm of 3D object models from multiple silhouettes is proposed in this paper. Some images of the target object are taken from a circular trajectory by a robot with a camera mounted in an eye-in-hand configuration. The silhouettes of the observed object are evaluated for each view using a blob analysis process, and from those a set of points that sample a reconstruction sphere surrounding the target object are estimated. The sphere sample points are attracted by the object center of mass using a variable step according to the distance from the silhouettes contours. For each point, the iterative process of constriction is stopped when all the back-projections of the point are within the corresponding silhouettes. Moreover, a new method based on a rough estimation of object dimension is proposed to reduce the disturbances due to projection and shadow cones. Simulations and experiments are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a recent study in which an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with a high resolution stereo-imaging system was used to document nocturnal camouflage behaviour in cuttlefish at a well known spawning site in Whyalla, South Australia. The AUV's ability to fly at low altitude during day and night while closely following a desired survey pattern provided improved data collection compared to divers and previous work with a small ROV. Over the course of the week long expedition, the AUV Sirius was deployed on 38 dives at three sites in the survey area and collected tens of thousands of stereo images. Of these, nearly a thousand were seen to contain cuttlefish during post cruise analysis, with a large proportion showing evidence of camouflage. The distribution of images containing cuttlefish suggest that the animal concentrations were substantially higher closer in to shore in shallow waters, where the flat rocky substrate occurs; females lay their eggs on the underside of these rocks. Results demonstrate the strengths of using an AUV for surveying near-shore benthic habitats of ecological interest, with a particular emphasis on the ability to operate during both day and night time operations.",

The main idea is the notion of survivability, which measures the likelihood that numerous paths are obstructed by the same obstacle. This helps to improve robustness with respect to collision, which is an important challenge in the design of real-time planning algorithms. Efficient algorithms are presented for computing the survivability criterion and for selecting a subset of paths that optimize survivability from a larger collection. The algorithms are implemented and solutions are illustrated for two different systems. Chi-square tests are used to show uniform coverage obtained by using the computed paths in a simple breadth-first search. Random obstacle placement is used to show superior robustness of these primitives compared to uniform sampling of the control space.",

        "abstract": "As engineered systems that have traditionally been controlled centrally become more modular, distributed, and autonomous, techniques are needed to maintain control coordination among independent elements, often across a network with delays and bandwidth limitations. In particular, manufacturing systems may require tight coordination, or synchronization, among components acting on the same physical object. This paper addresses the problem of controller synchronization in such a system. We present an implementation of exact controller synchronization for independent controllers in a highly modular printing domain. Our approach, which allows networked controllers to join and leave a task dynamically, has produced excellent results on a high-speed printer prototype.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a new non-invasive brain-actuated wheelchair that relies on a P300 neurophysiological protocol and automated navigation. In operation, the subject faces a screen with a real-time virtual reconstruction of the scenario, and concentrates on the area of the space to reach. A visual stimulation process elicits the neurological phenomenon and the EEG signal processing detects the target area. This target area represents a location that is given to the autonomous navigation system, which drives the wheelchair to the desired place while avoiding collisions with the obstacles detected by the laser scanner. The accuracy of the brain-computer interface is above 94% and the flexibility of the sensor-based motion system allows for navigation in non-prepared and populated scenarios. The prototype has been validated with five healthy subjects in three experimental sessions: screening (an analysis of three different interfaces and its implications on the performance of the users), virtual environment driving (training and instruction of the users) and driving sessions with the wheelchair (driving tests along pre-established circuits). On the basis of the results, this paper reports a technical evaluation of the device and a variability study. All the users were able to successfully use the device with relative ease showing a great adaptation.",

        "abstract": "Many studies have explored the use of tactile cues, however they were confined to the unilateral display device. Although lots of bilateral haptic devices have been developed to provide a guiding force on an input handle, however, a vibrotactile stimuli has not been tried to present directional information on the handle. This research introduces an attempt to combine a tactile display with an input device. A new 6DOF bilateral haptic device, which provides a spatial sensation on the handle using vibrotactile display, is proposed in this research. The sphere-shape handle is specially designed to be covered with several pieces of vibrating panels. When a specific panel is activated, the user perceives the spatial location of the vibrotactile stimulus during an input operation. This paper introduces the design of the proposed device, including the selection guide of the dimension, location, and number of vibrotactile panels. The method for combination of vibrotactile stimulus and the way to achieve fine resolution with small number of tactors are discussed. Experimental results show that the users can reliably perceive the directional information using the proposed device. An application for teleoperation of a robot proves the effectiveness and the usefulness of the proposed bilateral device.",

The sensor data preprocessing is embedded into the hand's hardware structure and is fully integrated. The sensor system is able to gather tactile pressure profiles and to measure vibrations in the sensor's cover. Additionally to the introduction of the hardware, the signal processing and the classification of the acquired sensor data will be explained in detail. These algorithms make the tactile sensing system capable to detect contact points, to classify contact patterns and to detect slip conditions during object manipulation and grasping.",

        "abstract": "Tankbot is a miniature, energy efficient, lightweight (60 g), and robust climbing robot. It uses the continuous detachment force (peeling) of the flat, bulk tacky elastomer tread to climb. An optimum peeling angle with a preliminary analysis of the pretension effect, and the tread force distributions are presented. A passive tail transfers the peeling force from the rear wheel to the front and ensures intimate continuous contact with the surface. Tankbot works in any orientation on smooth surfaces, such as glass and acrylic, of all slope angles (0 \u2013 360 degrees). However, the robot can only work vertically on relatively rough surfaces in any direction, such as wood, metal, painted wall, and painted brick. Tankbot can carry a payload of up to 40 g and 100 g on inverted and vertical surfaces, respectively. In addition, the robot can go over obstacles up to 15 mm tall on smooth vertical surfaces. Internal transitioning from horizontal to vertical and vertical to horizontal and external transitioning from vertical to the horizontal are also achieved. The potential applications of this robot include inspection, exploration, maintenance, cleaning, repair, and search and rescue.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this work is to enhance man-machine collaboration in cell production by task modeling approach. Task modeling provides a method to define and study the collaboration between man and machine. Six requirements have been derived as basis of development. In this work, the task modeling has extended classical HTA method to represent collaborative operation in a hierarchical structure with the classification of operation task levels and extended operation details as task properties. A modeling tool is developed to provide a development and data management platform. The man-machine collaboration is well defined in a structural format by the ability of task analysis method to address human task in a more flexible way. The collaboration modeling and operation resources information have significantly facilitated operation planning in both assembly and control levels. From the case study, the improvement in safety aspect has proven the ability of this approach in assisting safety design and development of production system. The integration with operation control system has shown the execution potential in real-time operation. The unique development of operation data management has expanded this work into operation information support. Through the multimodal information support system, the human operator is well guided by the operation information corresponded to the task components. The operation information also can work as evaluation functions to measure the human working performance and system performance as a whole.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study the kinematics of a legged robot with half-circular leg morphology. In particular, our focus is on the RHex hexapod platform. A new kinematic model for RHex is developed considering the leg shape and its consequences, which was over simplified in the previous models seen in literature. The formulation is an accurate kinematic representation of the robot in the sagittal plane that is based on a four-link mechanism analogy. When only pure rolling motion of the legs are considered, it is found that when front and rear pairs of legs are in contact with the ground, the robot becomes a one degree-of-freedom mechanism and position of the middle pair of legs are redundant. The problem is solved in two steps; the first one being the determination of the initial configuration of the leg angular positions which defines the initial value of the variable distance of the front and rear leg and ground contact points. After the initial configuration of the system is set, pitch angle of the robot body can be manipulated by controlling one of the leg angular positions and the results are presented on an example case; positioning a body fixed unactuated sensor by controlling robot body pitch angle through the actuation of one of the legs. The results are a good display of the multi-functional aspect of the legs in addition to their use for locomotion.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in the field of humanoid robotics increase the complexity of the tasks that such robots can perform. This makes it increasingly difficult and inconvenient to program these tasks manually. Furthermore, humanoid robots, in contrast to industrial robots, should in the distant future behave within a social environment. Therefore, it must be possible to extend the robot's abilities in an easy and natural way. To address these requirements, this work investigates the topic of imitation learning of motor skills. The focus lies on providing a humanoid robot with the ability to learn new bi-manual tasks through the observation of object trajectories. For this, an imitation learning framework is presented, which allows the robot to learn the important elements of an observed movement task by application of probabilistic encoding with Gaussian Mixture Models. The learned information is used to initialize an attractor-based movement generation algorithm that optimizes the reproduced movement towards the fulfillment of additional criteria, such as collision avoidance. Experiments performed with the humanoid robot ASIMO show that the proposed system is suitable for transferring information from a human demonstrator to the robot. These results provide a good starting point for more complex and interactive learning tasks.",

        "abstract": "In conventional task-space control problem of robots, a single task-space information is used for the entire task. When the task-space control problem is formulated in image space, this implies that visual feedback is used throughout the movement. While visual feedback is important to improve the endpoint accuracy in presence of uncertainty, the initial movement is primarily ballistic and hence visual feedback is not necessary. The relatively large delay in visual information would also make the visual feedback ineffective for fast initial movements. Due to limited field of view of the camera, it is also difficult to easure that visual feedback can be used for the entire task. Therefore, the task may fail if any of the features is out of view. In this paper, we present a new task-space control strategy that allows the use of dual task-space information in a single controller. We shall show that the proposed task-space controller can transit smoothly from Cartesian-space feedback at the initial stage to vision-space feedback at the end stage when the target is near.",

The method uses convex optimization techniques, and is therefore very fast and suitable for real-time re-planning and control. Second, we apply this approach to the tasks of planning foot and body trajectory for a quadruped robot, the ldquoLittleDog,rdquo and show that the proposed approach improves over previous work on this robot.",

In dynamic environments, where trajectories are evolving online, this is not a trivial task. The dynamical systems approach to robotics provides a framework for robust incorporation of fluctuating sensor information, but control of movement time is usually restricted to rhythmic motion and realized through stable limit cycles. The present work uses a Hopf oscillator to produce discrete motion and formulates an online adaptation rule to stabilize total movement time against a wide range of disturbances. This is integrated into a dynamical systems framework for the sequencing of movement phases and for directional navigation, using 2D-planar motion as an example. The approach is demonstrated on a Khepera mobile unit in order to show its reliability even when depending on low-level sensor information.",

        "abstract": "Tendon-based transmission systems present many positive aspects and greatly simplify the mechanical design of small robotic devices, such as robotic fingers. On the other hand, they introduce several nonlinear effects that must be properly considered by the control algorithms to achieve a suitable performance level in the regulation of the finger joint torques. In this paper, the model of the tendons-based driving system and of the nonlinear effects arising from the use of sliding paths instead of pulleys for the tendon routing are discussed, and control algorithms aiming at compensating these nonlinearities are presented. Both models and control algorithms have been validated by experiments. In particular, in order to gain a better insight on the force distribution along the tendon, an experimental setup for the measurement of the tension in some intermediate points has been developed. After the identification of the tendon characteristics, a suitable control law for the compensation of the nonlinear effects due to the friction acting on the transmission system has been applied. The proposed compensation scheme is based on a sliding-mode controller with boundary layer, where the boundary threshold is modulated as a function of the desired tendon tension.",

        "abstract": "Almost all commercially available haptic interfaces share a common pitfall, a small shoebox-sized workspace; these devices typically rely on rigid-link manipulator design concepts. In this paper we outline our design for a new kinesthetic haptic system that drastically increases the usable haptic workspace. We present a proof-of-concept prototype, along with our analysis of its capabilities. Our design uses optical tracking to sense the position of the device, and air jet actuation to generate forces. By combining these two technologies, we are able to detach our device from the ground, thus sidestepping many problems that have plagued traditional haptic devices including workspace size, friction, and inertia. We show that optical tracking and air jet actuation successfully enable kinesthetic haptic interaction with virtual environments. Given an appropriately large volume high-pressure air source, and a reasonably high speed tracking system, this design paradigm has many desirable qualities when compared to traditional haptic design schemes.",

In this respect, the Autonomous City Explorer (ACE) project aims to combine the research fields of autonomous mobile robot navigation and human robot interaction. A robot has been created that is capable of navigating in an unknown, highly populated, urban environment, based only on information extracted through interaction with passers-by and its local perception capabilities. This paper describes the algorithms and architecture that make up the navigation subsystem of ACE. More specifically, the algorithms used for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), path planning in dynamic environments and behavior selection are presented, as well as the system architecture that integrates them to a complete working system. Results from an extended field experiment, where the robot navigated autonomously through the downtown city area of Munich, are analyzed and show that the robot is capable of long-term, safe navigation in real-world settings.",

Using this database, we demonstrate a novel grasp planning algorithm that exploits geometric similarity between a 3D model and the objects in the database to synthesize form closure grasps.

In particular, the proposed solution aims at managing actuator velocity saturations by dynamically scaling task velocity commands so that the hierarchy of task priorities is preserved in spite of actuator velocity saturations.

The approach is validated by numerical simulations and by experimental results with a non-holonomic mobile robot.",

The mechanical structure consists of a neck with four degrees of freedom (DOFs) and two eyes (a stereo pair system) which tilt on a common axis and rotate sideways freely providing a three more DOFs. The motion control algorithm is designed to receive, as an input, the output of a biological-inspired vision processing algorithm and to exploit the redundancy of the joints for the realization of the movements. The expressions of the humanoid head are implemented by projecting light from the internal part of the translucent plastic cover.",

        "abstract": "A simple, compact, yet powerful robotic winch, called ldquoWinch-Bot,rdquo is presented in this paper. The Winch-Bot is an underactuated robot having only one controllable axis. Although hanging a load with merely one cable, it is capable of moving it in a large workspace by swinging the load dynamically based on parametric self-excitation. The generated trajectories can be used for a variety of tasks, from moving material to cyclic inspection of surfaces. The basic principle and design concept of the Winch-Bot are first described, followed by dynamic modeling and analysis. Two trajectory generation problems are solved. One is point-to-point transfer of a load, and the other is the tracking of a continuous path. It will be shown that the system can track a given geometric trajectory, although the tracking velocity cannot be determined arbitrarily due to the underactuated nature of dynamics. A prototype Winch-Bot is designed and built, and point-to-point, continuous path, and parametric excitation control are implemented.",

To improve such human-robot interaction, a system is presented that provides dialog structure and engages the human in an exploratory teaching scenario. Thereby, we specifically target untrained users, who are supported by mixed-initiative interaction using verbal and non-verbal modalities. We present the principles of dialog structuring based on an object learning and manipulation scenario. System development is following an interactive evaluation approach and we will present both an extensible, event-based interaction architecture to realize mixed-initiative and evaluation results based on a video-study of the system. We show that users benefit from the provided dialog structure to result in predictable and successful human-robot interaction.",

        "abstract": "Wings of insects are flexible structures. Although there has been much recent progress in the area of insect flight aerodynamics, very little is known about how wing flexibility influences aerodynamic forces during flapping flight. We investigated this question using a dynamically scaled mechanical model of insect wings. Using a suite of wings with varying flexural stiffness (EI) values, we generated aerodynamic polar plots to characterize the force coefficients of flexible wings. These polar plots showed that the aerodynamic performance of the wings varied with wing flexibility. In general, aerodynamic force production decreased with increasing flexibility. Both lift and drag coefficients of wings are greater when wings are more rigid. However, at very high angles of attack, flexible wings generated greater lift than a rigid wing. In addition, the ratio of lift-to-drag also decreased with increasing flexibility. These data show that flexible wings offer no aerodynamic advantage over a rigid wing under steady state circumstances. Because wing material in insects is usually flexible but reinforced by wing veins, we tested the hypothesis that wing veins enhance the aerodynamic performance of wings by increasing their effective stiffness. Our data suggests that even a very basic framework of appropriately placed wing veins can substantially increase the functional rigidity of the wings thereby enhancing its aerodynamic performance.",

Solutions to the routing problem require the robot to have a good estimate of its own pose. We present a novel security system that uses metrics generated by the localisation algorithm to perform adaptive anomaly detection. The localisation algorithm is a vision-based SLAM solution called RatSLAM, based on mechanisms within the hippocampus. The anomaly detection algorithm is based on the mechanisms used by the immune system to identify threats to the body. The system is explored using data gathered within an unmodified office environment. It is shown that the algorithm successfully reacts to the presence of people and objects in areas where they are not usually present and is tolerised against the presence of people in environments that are usually dynamic.",

        "abstract": "Viscoelasticity is the phenomenon of time-dependent strain and/or stress in elastic solids. Various contact interfaces with anthropomorphic end-effectors and polymeric solids found in robots and manipulators are intrinsically viscoelastic. It is therefore important to model such behavior and to study the effects of such time-dependent strain and stress on the stability and sustainability of grasping and manipulation. Various models have been proposed over the years to describe such behavior of time-dependent strain and stress. Furthermore, viscoelastic solids also display typically nonlinear elastic response. Built upon a variety of literature, a new and practical latency model is proposed in this paper for the application of contact interface involving viscoelasticity in robotics. Latency model can describe various features of viscoelastic materials, such as stress relaxation, creep, and material clock. The theoretical modeling was supported by experiments in which we found two types of relaxation, depending on the loading and unloading of grasping or contact. One type is well documented in existing literature; but the other type has not been, to our best knowledge, presented before. The proposed theory can unify both types of time-dependent relaxation responses.",

        "abstract": "With the goal of developing human-like dextrous manipulation, we investigate how the central nervous system uses the redundant control space of the human hand to perform tasks with force-stiffness requirements. Specifically, while the human hand is actuated by several muscles with varying mechanical advantage (called the moment arm), it is unclear how each muscle is used. Using the anatomically correct testbed (ACT) robotic hand to compute the control solution space and human-subject experiments with surface electromyography to measure biological control strategy, we identified that there is significant redundancy in the control spaces of both muscles with large moment arms and muscles with small moment arms. However, the central nervous system was selective about the solution for muscles with large moment arms, while it chose to span large regions of the available control space for muscles with small moment arms. Furthermore, the biological solution used low-moment-arm muscles at relatively high actuation levels. We summarize by making inferences on why the central nervous system chooses such a strategy and how this can help robotic manipulation.",

A thermal model, verified using empirical data, predicts the motor's winding temperature based on measured case temperature and input current.

When observing objects in water through a camera contained in a waterproof housing or observing objects in an aquarium tank filled with preserving liquid, we should solve a problem of light refraction at the boundary surfaces of refractive index discontinuity which gives image distortion. The proposed method uses a space encoding method which does not have a problem of corresponding point detection as a stereo vision system has, and is faster than spot light projection or slit light projection methods. A ray tracing technique solves the problem of image distortion caused by refractive index discontinuity. It should be noted that monochromatic light projection onto objects gives more accurate measurement than white light projection because the refractive index depends on the wavelength of the light. Then, in order to measure colored objects, we should project red, green and blue light patterns onto them separately. Experimental results show the validity of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "For vehicles navigating initially unknown cluttered environments, current state-of-the-art planning algorithms are able to plan and re-plan dynamically-feasible paths efficiently and robustly. It is still a challenge, however, to deal well with the surroundings that are both cluttered and highly dynamic. Planning under these conditions is more difficult for two reasons. First, tracking and predicting the trajectories of moving objects (i.e., cars, humans) is very noisy. Second, the planning process is computationally more expensive because of the increased dimensionality of the state-space, with time as an additional variable. Moreover, re-planning needs to be invoked more often since the trajectories of moving obstacles need to be constantly re-estimated. In this paper, we develop a path planning algorithm that addresses these challenges. First, we choose a representation of dynamic obstacles that efficiently models their predicted trajectories and the uncertainty associated with the predictions. Second, to provide real-time guarantees on the performance of planning with dynamic obstacles, we propose to utilize a novel data structure for planning - a time-bounded lattice - that merges together short-term planning in time with longterm planning without time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in both simulations with up to 30 dynamic obstacles and on real robots.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The authors have recently proposed the method of rolling indentation over soft tissue to rapidly identify soft tissue properties for localization and detection of tissue abnormalities, with the aim of compensating for the loss of haptics information experienced during robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS). This paper investigates the concept of rolling indentation using finite element modeling. To obtain ground truth data, rolling indentation experiments are conducted on a silicone phantom which contains three simulated tumours. The tissue phantom is modeled as hyperelastic material using ABAQUStrade. The identification of tumours includes two parts: firstly, when the spatial location of tumour is known, identify the tumour's mechanical properties (initial shear modulus); secondly if the mechanical properties of tumour are known, identify the tumour's spatial location. The results show that the proposed method can identify information of tumours accurately and robustly. The identified tumour mechanical properties and tumour locations are in good agreement with experimental measurements.",

        "abstract": "Manual palpation of tissue and organs during a surgical procedure provides clinicians with valuable information for diagnosis and surgical planning. In present-day robotassisted minimally invasive surgery systems, lack of perceptible haptic feedback makes it challenging to detect a tumor in an organ or a calcified artery in heart tissue. This study presents an automated tissue property estimation method and a real-time graphical overlay that allow an operator to discriminate hard and soft tissues. We first evaluate experimentally the properties of an artificial tissue and compare seven possible mathematical tissue models. Self-validation as well as cross-validation confirm that the Hunt-Crossley model best describes the experimentally observed phantom tissue properties and is suitable for our purpose. Second, we present the development of a system in which the phantom tissue is palpated using a teleoperated surgical robot, and the stiffness of the Hunt-Crossly model is estimated in real time by recursive least squares. A real-time visual overlay representing tissue stiffness is created using a hue-saturation-luminance representation on a semi-transparent disc at the tissue surface. Hue depicts the stiffness at a palpated point and saturation is calculated based on distance from the point. A simple interpolation technique creates a continuous stiffness color map. In an experiment, the graphical overlay successfully shows the location of an artificial calcified artery hidden in phantom tissue.",

All fingers are 90 mm in length and the weight of the hand is 941 g. The hand can generate a large grasp force with a force-magnification mechanism whereas all joints can perform a high speed motion of over 200 deg/s with a high-speed driving mechanism. The high-speed driving mechanism consists of a feed screw and nut with a low reduction ratio. We propose a simple and small three-dimensional toggle mechanism for the force-magnification mechanism. The toggle mechanism thrusts the feed screw and nut of the high-speed driving mechanism when the finger is in contact with an object. It can maintain a large grasp force without energy consumption. We experimentally verify the force and speed performances.",

Approximate cell decomposition and normalized graph cut are applied to sonar gridmap to extract graphical model of the environment. The extracted model represents spatial relation of the environment appropriately by segmenting several subregions. Moreover, node classification is achieved by applying template matching method to a local gridmap. Rotational invariant matching is used to obtain candidate location for each node and the true node can be classified by considering detail distance information. The proposed method extracts well-structured topological model of the environment and classification also results in reliable matching even under the uncertain and sparse sonar data. Experimental results verify the performance of proposed environmental modeling and classification in real home environment.",

The algorithm produces the possible topologies, given the design constraints, desired performance, and available modules, such that all constraints are satisfied for every point in the desired workspace. This is achieved through the use of interval analysis methods and branch-and-bound loop that searches through the end-effector pose and the design parameter spaces. The resulting algorithm is demonstrated through an example of a serial chain manipulator made of the reconfigurable modules of the surgical robot for the application. The results are presented and discussed.",

By rotating and extending the tubes with respect to each other, the position and orientation of the needle tip, as well as the shape of the inserted length, can be controlled. Prior models neglected torsional twisting in the curved portions of the tubes. This paper presents a mechanics model that includes torsion, applies to any number of tubes and allows curvature and stiffness to vary with arc length. While the general model is comprised of differential equations, an analytic solution is given for two tubes of constant curvature. This solution enables analytic prediction of ldquosnap throughrdquo instability based on a single dimensionless parameter. Simulation and experiments are used to illustrate the results.",

The dynamics leading to (or recovering from) ischemia is a good index for evaluating the vitality of tissue. This paper discusses the ischemia dynamics by using a newly developed active sensing system composed of an air jet nozzle for imparting an air pulse to tissue and a high-speed camera for capturing the change of color of tissue with respect to time. Through experiments, we found that the ischemia dynamics is particularly characterized by the recovery phase where the time constant changes depending upon the local physical condition of tissue. We also showed a map on color changing rate conveniently utilized for quickly understanding the location of ischemia area which is a candidate replaced by regenerated tissue.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a system for in situ atmospheric sensing using an aerial robot system in the presence of a strong wind field. The geostatistical concept of the variogram is used to characterize regions of the environment with high variability, which is assumed to correlate with scientific interest. After regions of interest are identified, ordered upwind methods are used to generate feasible trajectories in the face of strong background wind. The feasible trajectories are combined with the variogram characterization to select feasible paths that travel through the regions of highest interest. The system is tested in simulation using data from a simulated severe storm.",

More specifically, we show that it is possible to embed within such microrobots, photovoltaic cells supplying \u223c4\u00b5W necessary to power an internal microelectronic circuit providing embedded intelligence with the capability to communicate commands and data wirelessly to an external computer. We also show that such data or commands transmitted wirelessly could be used to instruct an external computer to send a swarm of flagellated bacteria to move such microrobots towards a specific target based on various sensory information acquired with specific sensors embedded in each microrobots. Similar to chemotaxis used by several species of flagellated bacteria, the algorithms used to move such microrobots could be governed by a larger range of sensory means, leading to what we refer to here as sensotaxis-based hybrid microrobots. The possibility of transmitting a request to a central computer to send a swarm of flagellated magnetotactic bacteria to provide propulsion and steering in order to move accurately to desired locations would allow such microrobots to perform collective tasks. A simple example suggesting the possibility of implementing accurate collective tasks by such hybrid microrobots is demonstrated experimentally where a microstructure emulating a V-shaped microrobot is moved and rotated autonomously using a swarm of approximately 3000 flagellated bacteria towards another similar V-shaped microstructure to form the character \u2018M\u2019 as in Microrobot.",

The tracked mechanism is of circular cross-section and has active rolling axes at the center of the circles. Conventional tracked mechanisms can support massive loads, but cannot produce sideways motion. Additionally, previous crawler edges sink undesirably on soft ground, particularly when the vehicle body is subject to a sideways tilt. The proposed design solves these drawbacks by adopting a circular cross-section crawler. A prototype has been developed to illustrate the concept. Motion experiments confirm the novel properties of this mechanism: sideways motion and robustness against edge-sink. Motion experiments, with a test vehicle are also presented.",

        "abstract": "People in densely populated environments typically form groups that split and merge. In this paper we track groups of people so as to reflect this formation process and gain efficiency in situations where maintaining the state of individual people would be intractable. We pose the group tracking problem as a recursive multi-hypothesis model selection problem in which we hypothesize over both, the partitioning of tracks into groups (models) and the association of observations to tracks (assignments). Model hypotheses that include split, merge, and continuation events are first generated in a data-driven manner and then validated by means of the assignment probabilities conditioned on the respective model. Observations are found by clustering points from a laser range finder given a background model and associated to existing group tracks using the minimum average Hausdorff distance. Experiments with a stationary and a moving platform show that, in populated environments, tracking groups is clearly more efficient than tracking people separately. Our system runs in real-time on a typical desktop computer.",

        "abstract": "Successful ophthalmic surgeries using intraocular untethered microrobots or tethered robotic microtools require methods to robustly track the microdevices in the posterior of the human eye. The dimensions and specularities of the microdevices are major obstacles for accurate tracking. In addition, the optical structure of the human eye makes it challenging to keep the objects of interest constantly in focus, resulting in blurred images. In this paper, the advantages of using different colorspaces for intraocular tracking are examined. After selection of the appropriate colorspace, thresholds that ensure maximum separation of the device from the background are calculated. Based on trained color histograms, level sets are used to track in real time, and the use of statistical shape information is incorporated in the existing tracking framework. The efficacy of the algorithm is demonstrated by tracking a microrobot in a model eye, using a custom made ophthalmoscope and off-the-shelf ophthalmoscopy lenses. With the appropriate colorspace and threshold selection, tracking errors are minimized and are further diminished using shape information.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel methodology for detection and tracking of facial features like eyes, nose and mouth in image sequences. The proposed methodology is intended to support natural interaction with autonomously navigating robots that guide visitors in museums and exhibition centers and, more specifically, to provide input for the analysis of facial expressions that humans utilize while engaged in various conversational states. For face and facial feature region detection and tracking, we propose a methodology that combines appearance-based and feature-based methods for recognition and tracking, respectively. For the stage of face tracking the introduced method is based on least squares matching (LSM), a matching technique able to model effectively radiometric and geometric differences between image patches in different images. Thus, compared with previous research, the LSM approach can overcome the problems of variable scene illumination and head in-plane rotation. Another significant characteristic of the proposed approach is that tracking is performed on the image plane only wherever laser range information suggests so. The increased computational efficiency meets the real time demands of human-robot interaction applications and hence facilitates the development of relevant systems.",

The proposed force distribution algorithm is aimed to enhance the vehicle stability with minimum cost. The algorithm avoids the use of any feedback information of vehicle motion such as linear velocity as this information is difficult to measure accurately and the price of the measuring equipment is very high. As a result, the implementation cost can be reduced and at the same time avoid improper force distribution due to the inaccurate measured information. Moreover, the proposed algorithm does not involve any parameter tuning. It makes the algorithm easy to implement. The proposed algorithm can also be applied to any steering types of 4WID vehicle such as typical two wheel steering (2WS) as 4WIS is the general case of any steering configuration. Simulation results reveal that the performance of the proposed force distribution is superior to the uniform force distribution which is commonly used in 4WID vehicle.",

        "abstract": "In a previous paper, we developed a robotic finger equipped with optical three-axis tactile sensors, of which the sensing cell can separately detect normal and shearing forces. With appropriate precision, the robotic finger was able to perform three tasks: scanning flat specimens to obtain the friction coefficient, following the contour of objects, and manipulating a parallelepiped case put on a table by sliding it on the table. In the present study, designed as a follow-up to the above study, a robotic hand is composed of two robotic fingers. Not only tri-axial force distribution directly obtained from the tactile sensor but also the time derivative of the shearing force distribution are used for the hand control algorithm: if grasping force measured from normal force distribution is lower than a threshold, grasping force is increased; the time derivative is defined as slippage; if slippage arises, grasping force is enhanced to prevent fatal slippage between the finger and an object. In the verification test, the robotic hand screws a bottle cap to close it. Although input finger trajectories were a rectangular roughly decided to touch and screw the cap, a segment of the rectangular was changed from a straight line to a curved line to fit the cap contour. We concluded that higher order tactile information such as tri-axial tactile data can reduce the complexity of the control algorithm.",

The ballbot is an underactuated system with nonholonomic dynamic constraints. The authors propose an offline trajectory planning algorithm that provides a class of parametric trajectories to the unactuated joint in order to reach desired static configurations of the system with regard to the dynamic constraint. The parameters of the trajectories are obtained using optimization techniques. A feedback controller is proposed that ensures accurate trajectory tracking. The trajectory planning algorithm and tracking controller are validated experimentally. The authors also extend the offline trajectory planning algorithm to a generalized case of motion between non-static configurations.",

        "abstract": "In this study, a tactile-roughness transmission system applicable to master-slave systems with a communication time delay is developed. The master-side system constructs a local model of target objects placed in the slave-side environment. Tactile feedbacks presented to an operator at the master side are produced by combining the physical properties of target objects in the local model and the kinetic information of the operator. The time delay between the operator's motion and the tactile feedback is cancelled because the stimuli are synchronized with the exploratory motions. The proposed system is applied to the transmission of tactile-roughness. The tactile stimuli presented to the operator are vibratory stimuli whose amplitude and frequency are controlled. These stimuli are locally synthesized by combining the surface wavelength of target objects and the operator's hand velocity. Using the developed tactile-roughness transmission system, an experiment for transmitting the perceived roughness of grating scales was conducted. As a result, the roughness perceived by the operators was found to highly correlate with the roughness of the scales in the slave-side environment with a coefficient of 0.83.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Many terrains in outdoor robot navigation problems have paths that are distinct and continuous compared to the non-traversable regions. In image space these paths correspond to continuous segments that can be thought of as clusters embedded in image feature space. These segments very often translate directly to traversable ground plane. In this paper we build the intuition for semi-supervised methods in path identification and present a Markov random walk based approach that requires very few labeled points. The method creates a nearest neighbor graph representation of the current image frame using features deemed suitable for the task and propagates labels based on the concept of absorbing Markov chains. We extend this formalism to the task of dynamically identifying traversable and non-traversable regions in the incoming image frames. We present results on actual terrains corresponding to test courses used by the LAGR test team. The results demonstrate that with minimal initial supervision the robot can navigate to the goal. We also conduct comparisons of our path labeling technique against other machine learning techniques including nonlinear support vector machines on hand labeled data. The results demonstrate that our semi-supervised approach is proficient in the domain of path traversal in unstructured domains.",

He needs special tools manipulated through robotic systems. Therefore, force feedback devices are the only solution to provide him a sense of touch. However, the quality of the rendering strongly influences his ability to perform a given task. Stability is the main requirement that the system must fulfil to be usable. As the choice of the controller and its tuning are critical issues, a general method to tune the parameters of two haptic controllers is presented. A theoretical study is carried out and the methodology is validated with an experiment composed of several phases with high dynamic phenomena. Intrinsic limitations of the two controllers are also pointed out.",

        "abstract": "We investigated whether flapping flight has an inherent stability by analyzing the inertial and aerodynamic effects of flapping wings on body dynamics. Based on wing and body kinematics of free flying fruit flies during rapid maneuvers, we found a passive counter torque due to body rotation. It is identified both in simulation through quasi-steady state aerodynamic model and through experiments on a dynamically scaled robotic wing. An analytical form is derived correspondingly. In the turning yaw axis, the estimated damping coefficient of flapping wings is significantly higher than body frictional damping; this indicates a passive deceleration during turning. By simulating insect to rotate about each principal axis of inertial and body frames, we calculated the corresponding damping coefficients, and further analyzed the attitude stability. The result reveals that, passive damping of flapping flight, while does not necessarily lead to a stable full body dynamics, provides a considerable passive restoring torque that could be critical for flight stabilization and control in the design of micro aerial vehicles. Preliminary analysis on the scaling parameters of passive damping was also performed.",

There are currently no reliable, off-the-shelf, commercially-available force sensors to measure forces at this scale, that can be easily integrated into standard microrobotic test-beds. Our design consists of a planar, elastic mechanism with known force-deflection characteristics. A CCD camera is used to track the deformation of the mechanism as it is used to manipulate objects in a micro/meso-scale robotic manipulation test-bed. By observing the displacements of select points in the mechanism, the manipulation forces can be estimated. The modeling, design, microfabrication, calibration and experimental validation of the force sensor are presented with a brief discussion of an application to a robotic manipulation tasks such as microassembly.",

A pursuit-evasion strategy aims at optimizing the visibility of the pursuer UAV after having predicted the best action for the evading target. This is achieved by using two iterative methods that optimise various mission based criteria: obstacle avoidance and visibility maximisation for the UAV and stealthy motions for the target.",

        "abstract": "The present paper explores the effect of the mechanism-substrate frictional interface on the locomotion characteristics of robotic mechanisms employing traveling waves for propulsion. For these investigations, an extended class of undulatory robotic locomotors is considered, termed pedundulatory, which augment lateral body undulations by coordinated dorso-ventral oscillations of multiple pairs of lateral paddle-shaped appendages (parapodia). We examine how, the same robotic prototype, allows the implementation of four distinct bio-inspired undulatory and pedundulatory modes of locomotion, by modifying the motion control strategy depending on the mechanism-substrate frictional interface. These modes employ retrograde or direct body waves, either standalone (giving rise to eel-like and ochromonas-like undulatory locomotion modes, respectively), or combined with appropriately coordinated substrate contact by the parapodial appendages (giving rise to centipede-like and polychaete-like pedundulatory modes, respectively). These four modes are investigated and comparatively assessed, both in simulation and via extensive experiments on granular substrates with the Nereisbot prototype. Our results validate the identified locomotion principles and also highlight the enhanced performance and gait repertoire of pedundulatory systems, compared to purely undulatory ones.",

The contribution of this paper is a deterministic motion planning algorithm to envelop multiple obstacles in an admissible set of goal configurations while eliminating the risk of module collision or deadlock.

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of forming appropriate heterogeneous robot teams to solve tightly-coupled, potentially multi-robot tasks, in which the robot capabilities may vary over the environment in which the task is being performed. Rather than making use of a permanent tightly-coupled robot team for performing the task, our approach aims to recognize when tight coupling is needed, and then only form tight cooperative teams at those times. This results in important cost savings, since coordination is only used when the independent operation of the team members would put mission success at risk. Our approach is to define a new semantic information type, called environmentally dependent information, which allows us to capture certain environmentally-dependent perceptual constraints on vehicle capabilities. We define locations at which the robot team must transition between tight and weak cooperation as critical junctures. Note that these critical juncture points are a function of the robot team capabilities and the environmental characteristics, and are not due to a change in the task itself. We calculate critical juncture points by making use of our prior ASyMTRe approach, which can automatically configure heterogeneous robot team solutions to enable sharing of sensory capabilities across robots. We demonstrate these concepts in experiments involving a human-controlled blimp and an autonomous ground robot in a target localization task.",

This model can be queried for any of over 25,000 naturally occurring objects in the world and is trained from labeled data acquired from the captions of photos on the Flickr Website. We show that these simple models based on object co-occurrences perform surprisingly well at localizing arbitrary objects in an office setting. In addition, we show how to compute paths that minimize the expected distance to the query object and show that this approach performs better than a greedy approach. Finally, we give preliminary results for grounding our approach in object classifiers.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A main difficulty that arises in the context of probabilistic localization is the design of an appropriate observation model, i.e., determining the likelihood of a sensor measurement given the pose of the robot and a map of the environment. Many successful approaches to localization rely on data provided by range sensors, e.g., laser range scanners. When using such data one normally has to deal with erroneous maximum-range readings that occur due to poor-reflecting surfaces. In general, these readings cannot be distinguished from readings obtained when no obstacle is within the measurement range of the sensor. Therefore, existing localization techniques treat these readings alike in the observation model. In this paper, we present a novel approach that explicitly considers the reflection properties of surfaces and thus the expectation of valid range measurements. In addition to the expected range measurement, we compute the probability of reflectance for a beam given the relative pose of the robot to the obstacle taking into account the angle of incidence of the beam. We estimate the reflection properties of surfaces using data collected with a mobile robot equipped with a laser range scanner. As we demonstrate in experiments carried out with a real robot, our technique leads to significantly improved localization results compared to a state-of-the-art observation model.",

Contrary to existing approaches, we took into account the four sub-images existence in the design of this method, in order to exploit redundancy.

        "abstract": "Flexible, lightweight manipulators offer some advantages in contrast to rigid arms, such as compact and lighter drives, energy efficiency, reduced masses and costs. This paper presents a novel approach for vibration damping of a multi-link flexible arm. The strain of the elastic arms is measured with Fiber-Bragg-Grating (FBG) sensors and provides the feedback signal to dampen their flexural dynamics. A dynamic model of a three link arm is derived that accounts for the rigid and flexural dynamics including gravity. The arm vibrations are damped by nonlinear strain feedback. The controller is general and robust and its design does not require a model of the flexural dynamics. In the context of closed loop vibration control FBG sensors offer a better signal to noise ratio compared to strain gauges, which allows a higher static gain in the feedback loop with more efficient dissipation of vibrational energy. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed vibration control scheme in conjunction with FBG sensors is verified and analyzed in simulations and confirmed in experiments with a flexible three link robot arm.",

The unmanned aircraft system ground operations management system (UGOMS) described here combines measurements from a computer vision system and inertial sensors with an airport layout database to provide real-time position determination on the airfield surface. UGOMS provides both absolute position of the aircraft as well as relative position to airport surface elements such as runway hold lines and taxiway edges. The key technical components of UGOMS are computer vision algorithms that classify image regions, Markov localization using particle filters, and a navigation architecture which incorporates the localization information. An overview of the overall UGOMS architecture is presented as well as preliminary test results using an uncertain airfield map to highlight the performance capabilities of the system.",

It consists of a transparent flexible sheet and a computer display; the display is placed behind the sheet. The user feels the softness of the object by pushing the sheet, and sees the stereoscopic CG image of the deformed object through the sheet. In the present study we propose a new method of detecting finger touch on the sheet and measuring the indentation of the contact point; the method is specialized for this haptic device. A camera is placed behind the sheet. A checkered pattern is reflected on the backside of the sheet like a two-way mirror. The camera monitors this reflected pattern. When the finger pushes the sheet, the sheet is deformed. Then the reflected pattern near the fingertip, seen from the camera, is distorted. Monitoring this distortion makes it possible to detect finger touch on the sheet. As the indentation of the contact point increases, the reflected pattern is more distorted. Thus measuring the amount of the distortion allows the measurement of the indentation. The proposed method is ascertained by some experiments.",

Without external sensing, an estimation system that relies only on integrating inertial data will have rapidly drifting position estimates. Micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) are stringently weight-constrained, leaving little margin for additional sensors beyond the mission payload. The approach taken in this paper is to introduce an architecture that exploits a common mission payload, namely a video camera, as a dual-use sensor to aid in navigation. Several core algorithms, including a fast environment mapper and a novel heuristic for obstacle avoidance, are also presented. Finally, drift-free hover and obstacle avoidance flight tests in a controlled environment are presented and analyzed.",

Formation schemes in straight lines and diagonal formations are introduced which are both stable and observable in the presence of limited views. The algorithms are novel since they only use local image measurements through a pinhole camera to estimate the leader's position. This approach does not require specialized markings nor extensive robot communications. The algorithms are also decentralized. We apply an input-output feedback linearization for system stability and utilize an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for estimation. Simulations illustrate how the proposed formation controls work. Real experiments utilizing multiple miniature robots are also presented and illustrate the challenges associated with noisy images in real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an approach for integrating vision, tactile and force sensors in a robotic manipulation framework. Having an initial estimation of the object pose in the environment, a position-based visual servoing loop controls the hand for task execution, based on the input received from a model-based articular pose estimator following the Virtual Visual Servoing approach. The visual control is combined with another control signal obtained from tactile feedback, through a set of selection matrices that can be modified at runtime in order to select the best modality for a given cartesian degree of freedom. The result of the preliminary integration is modified by an impedance force controller, in charge of performing the task motion along the task direction, at the same time that forces are regulated on the rest of directions. The design of the controller allows to perform the task even if a sensor is not available or provides inaccurate data. Several experiments are performed, first by considering only force feedback, and then adding vision and, finally, tactile information. Errors in the estimation of the object initial position are manually introduced in the experiments, and results show how the vision-tactile-force combination is able to deal with them, performing much better than the vision-force and force-alone approaches.",

In this paper, we propose a scheme for visual surprise detection in cognitive mobile robots. With the robot's observation and a set of reference images previously acquired near its current viewpoint, a pixel-wise surprise trigger is computed using Bayesian probabilistic inference techniques. With appropriate mathematical approximations this algorithm can be implemented on modern graphics hardware which nearly allows for real-time surprise detection. In order to refer to prior observations, a mobile robot has to be able to re-localize itself with respect to its environment. Thus, we also present two online image-based homing algorithms which both facilitate the computation of location-independent surprise triggers. Experiments show acceptable results in terms of robust and fast detection of unexpected changes in the environment.",

        "abstract": "Wireless resonant magnetic micro-actuators have been previously described as highly effective propulsion mechanisms for untethered mobile microrobots. The discussion thus far has been primarily relegated to a characterization of stationary devices and the de facto observation of their mobility. Before applications of microrobots can be more fully explored, devices are required that can operate reliably and repeatably in a host of operating environments. In this paper, we analyze the in situ performance of resonant magnetic actuators for microrobotic locomotion to better understand their durability, substrate requirements, and driving characteristics.",

        "abstract": "Visual localization and mapping for mobile robots has been achieved with a large variety of methods. Among them, topological navigation using vision has the advantage of offering a scalable representation, and of relying on a common and affordable sensor. In previous work, we developed such an incremental and real-time topological mapping and localization solution, without using any metrical information, and by relying on a Bayesian visual loop-closure detection algorithm. In this paper, we propose an extension of this work by integrating metrical information from robot odometry in the topological map, so as to obtain a globally consistent environment model. Also, we demonstrate the performance of our system on the global localization task, where the robot has to determine its position in a map acquired beforehand.",

        "abstract": "Hopping is a very efficient locomotion method for a robot in an unconstructed environment or a complicated terrain. Small hopping robots have many interesting properties in comparison to the larger ones. However, relatively little research has been reported on hopping microrobot, while most of existing designs of hopping robots are not suitable to scale down. In this paper we propose a novel hopping mechanism that is based on the working principle of voice coil actuator. This mechanism is relatively easy to miniaturize and the hopping performance improves in a smaller scale. Two prototypes are developed based on electromagnetic simulation and an analytic model of hopping process. The first prototype has a dimension of \u03a630 mm \u00d7 10 mm and a mass of 41.59 g, with a hopping height of about 45 mm. The second one has a dimension of \u03a614 mm \u00d7 6 mm and a mass of 4.94 g, and achieves a hopping height of about 65 mm.",

We cannot fully capture the essence of motion without tactile information, and sometimes the lack of such information causes critical problems. To achieve a better understanding of motion behavior, we developed a wearable motion capture suit with full-body tactile sensors. We also developed a motion sensor which can estimate its orientation with its inner CPU. We also built a tactile sensor module which can fit many kinds of body shapes. With this system, we can measure a user's movement and tactile information simultaneously. By integrating tactile data with motion data, we can achieve many kinds of meaningful insights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this system with experiments. We captured two motions: stretching after sitting on a chair and laying down on a bed. By recognizing the contact point from the tactile data and fitting it into the environment, we were able to estimate the motion trajectories.",

In this paper, we describe an integrated robotic architecture that can achieve the above steps by translating natural language instructions incrementally and simultaneously into formal logical goal description and action languages, which can be used both to reason about the achievability of a goal as well as to generate new action scripts to pursue the goal. We demonstrate the implementation of our approach on a robot taking spoken natural language instructions in an office environment.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "An important component of human-robot interaction is that people need to be able to instruct robots to move to other locations using naturally given directions. When giving directions, people often make mistakes such as labelling errors (e.g., left vs. right) and errors of omission (skipping important decision points in a sequence). Furthermore, people often use multiple levels of granularity in specifying directions, referring to locations using single object landmarks, multiple landmarks in a given location, or identifying large regions as a single location. The challenge is to identify the correct path to a destination from a sequence of noisy, possibly erroneous directions. In our work we cast this problem as probabilistic inference: given a set of directions, an agent should automatically find the path with the geometry and physical appearance to maximize the likelihood of those directions. We use a specific variant of a Markov Random Field (MRF) to represent our model, and gather multi-granularity representation information using existing large tagged datasets. On a dataset of route directions collected in a large third floor university building, we found that our algorithm correctly inferred the true final destination in 47 out of the 55 cases successfully followed by humans volunteers. These results suggest that our algorithm is performing well relative to human users. In the future this work will be included in a broader system for autonomously constructing environmental representations that support natural human-robot interaction for direction giving.",

        "abstract": "In general, a mobile robot that operates in unknown environments has to maintain a map and has to determine its own location given the map. This introduces significant computational and memory constraints for most autonomous systems, especially for lightweight robots such as humanoids or flying vehicles. In this paper, we present a novel approach for learning a landmark selection policy that allows a robot to discard landmarks that are not valuable for its current navigation task. This enables the robot to reduce the computational burden and to carry out its task more efficiently by maintaining only the important landmarks. Our approach applies an unscented Kalman filter for addressing the simultaneous localization and mapping problems and uses Monte-Carlo reinforcement learning to obtain the selection policy. Based on real world and simulation experiments, we show that the learned policies allow for efficient robot navigation and outperform handcrafted strategies. We furthermore demonstrate that the learned policies are not only usable in a specific scenario but can also be generalized towards environments with varying properties.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach for motion primitive segmentation from continuous full body human motion captured on monocular video. The proposed approach does not require a kinematic model of the person, nor any markers on the body. Instead, optical flow computed directly in the image plane is used to estimate the location of segment points. The approach is based on detecting tracking features in the image based on the Shi and Thomasi algorithm [1]. The optical flow at each feature point is then estimated using the Lucas Kanade Pyramidal Optical Flow estimation algorithm [2]. The feature points are clustered and tracked on-line to find regions of the image with coherent movement. The appearance and disappearance of these coherent clusters indicates the start and end points of motion primitive segments. The algorithm performance is validated on full body motion video sequences, and compared to a joint-angle, motion capture based approach. The results show that the segmentation performance is comparable to the motion capture based approach, while using much simpler hardware and at a lower computational effort.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents wiping motion as a task during which the movement and deformation of a deformable object occur simultaneously. During the wiping motion of a deformable object, there is contact, but no relative movement, between the manipulator and the object, while there is both contact and relative movement between the object and the floor during the displacement of the object. We first describe wiping motion and distinguish wiping slide from wiping deformation by displacement of the internal points of an object. In addition, we show that a wiping motion is an extended system of pushing and sliding of rigid objects. As an example of wiping motion, we utilize grasping of a fabric, and we demonstrate the grasping motion of a fabric using a single-armed gripper.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a reconfigurable modular robotic system is proposed to augment the dexterity of endoluminal interventions in the gastrointestinal tract. In the proposed system, miniaturized robotic modules are ingested and assembled in the stomach cavity. The assembled robot can change its configuration according to the target location, thus enabling complicated surgical tasks. The robotic assembly, the robotic configuration and the surgical tasks are controlled via wireless bidirectional communication. Based on this concept, early prototypes of the robotic modules were designed and fabricated. The developed module has 2DOF (\u00b190\u00b0 of bending and 360\u00b0 of rotation), measures 15.4 mm in diameter and 36.5 mm in length. It weighs 5.6 g and contains a Li-Po battery, two brushless DC motors, and a custom-made control board capable of wireless communication. The performance of the bending and rotational motion was evaluated and the future work has been discussed.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "When a mobile robot does not have perfect knowledge of its position, conventional controllers can experience failures such as collisions because the uncertainty of the position is not considered in choosing control actions. In this paper, we show how global planning and local feedback control can be combined to generate control laws in the space of distributions over position, that is, in information space. We give a novel algorithm for computing \u201cinformation-constrained\u201d linear quadratic Gaussian (icLQG) policies for controlling a robot with imperfect state information. The icLQG algorithm uses the belief roadmap algorithm to efficiently search for a trajectory that approximates the globally-optimal motion plan in information space, and then iteratively computes a feedback control law to locally optimize the global approximation. The icLQG algorithm is not only robust to imperfect state information but also scalable to high-dimensional systems and environments. In addition, icLQG is capable of answering multiple queries efficiently. We demonstrate performance results for controlling a vehicle on the plane and a helicopter in three dimensions.",

        "abstract": "Probabilistic path planning techniques have proven to be vital for finding and validating solutions for difficult industrial assembly tasks. Nevertheless, the failure of a path planner to find a solution to a task does not suggest how to correct the error. We suggest a methodology to identify possible bottlenecks and present an algorithm to analyze the extent to which the design must be modified in order for the task to complete successfully. We validate our algorithm on two industrial problems involving design errors, and explain how to interpret the results in order to improve the design.",
