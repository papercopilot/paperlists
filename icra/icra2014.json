        "abstract": "We present a novel dynamic gait to control in-plane locomotion [1] (forward, back, clockwise and counter clockwise rotations) of a compliant legged hexapedal robot using a single actuator. The gait exploits the compliance disparity between alternate stance tripods, to generate rotation by controlling the acceleration of the robot [2]. The direction of turning depends on the configuration of the legs \u2014 tripod left or right- and the direction of the acceleration. Alternating acceleration in successive steps allows for continuous rotation in the desired direction. A simplified model of a robot is made and a numerical simulation was performed to analyze the behavior and optimize robot parameters. The robot is capable of rotating with a coefficient of friction as low as 0.2 but its performance improves as the COF increases up to 0.6. Beyond that, little change is noticed.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method to perform the outlier rejection task between two different views of a camera rigidly attached to an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Only two feature correspondences and gyroscopic data from IMU measurerments are used to compute the motion hypothesis. By exploiting this 2-point motion parametrization, we propose two algorithms to remove wrong data associations in the feature-matching process for case of a 6DoF motion. We show that in the case of a monocular camera mounted on a quadrotor vehicle, motion priors from IMU can be used to discard wrong estimations in the framework of a 2-point-RANSAC based approach. The proposed methods are evaluated on both synthetic and real data.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we proposed the implementation of 3D Set Partitioning In Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT) algorithm to a multi-lead ECG signal compression. The implementation of 3D SPIHT decorrelates three types of redundancy that commonly found on a multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signal i.e. intra-beat, inter-beat, and inter-lead redundancies. To optimize overall compression performance we also proposed beat reordering and residual calculation technique. Beat reordering rearranges beat order in 2D ECG array based on the similarity between adjacent beats. This rearrangement reduces variances between adjacent beats so that the 2D ECG array contains less high frequency component. Residual calculation optimizes required storage usage further by minimizing amplitude variance of 2D ECG array. The experiments on selected records from St Petersburg INCART 12-lead Arrhythmia Database show that proposed method gives relatively low distortion at compression rate 8 and 16.",

In this paper, a novel rail-guided multi-microrobotic system was proposed for the assembly of cellular structure. The cellular 2-dimensional (2D) module was fabricated by UV illumination of the crosslinkable hydrogel. The coordinated manipulation among the micromanipulators was performed with newly designed concentric movement along the rail, which realized the arbitrary change of micromanipulator posture. Through the rotation of the end-effectors around the specimen without swapping out the visual field, the manipulation flexibility was improved. The distance information between the micromanipulator and the module was acquired from vision feedback system and utilized for the automatic pick-up of the microstructure. Through the cooperation among multi-manipulators with hybrid motors, the micromanipulation to assemble the 3D structure with 30 nm operation resolution was achieved. Finally, the rail-guided DeSCom system realized the bottom-up fabrication of cellular vascular-like microtube with vision feedback.",

The method segments a 3D point set into a number of planar patches and extracts the Inter-Plane Relationships (IPRs) for all patches. Based on the IPRs, the method determines the High Level Feature (HLF) for each patch. A Gaussian-Mixture-Model-based plane classifier is then employed to classify each patch into one belonging to a certain model object. Finally, a recursive plane clustering procedure is performed to cluster the classified planes into the model objects. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has high success rates in object recognition with real-world data. Also, the method can be implemented for real-time operation.",

Using high resolution STereo Lithography (STL) models of the original decayed tooth and the target preparing shape as the input, our method consists of a fast slicing algorithm and an optimized path generating algorithm, which realized a high efficient layer-by-layer cutting for laser ablation. Theoretical analysis on the geometric distortion and surface roughness was carried out to model the influence of the path planning algorithms on the accuracy of the prepared tooth. Experimental results on a real tooth indicate that the path planning method can maintain the accuracy for the laser ablation process.",

However, to the best of the authors7 knowledge, no robotic prototype has been presented so far that combines additive layer manufacturing techniques with aerial robotics. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of such a hybrid approach and present the design and characterisation of an aerial 3D printer; a flying robot capable of depositing polyurethane expanding foam in mid-flight. We evaluate various printing materials and describe the design and integration of a lightweight printing module onto a quadcopter, as well as discuss the limitations and opportunities for aerial construction with flying robots using the developed technologies. Potential applications include ad-hoc construction of first response structures in search and rescue scenarios, printing structures to bridge gaps in discontinuous terrain, and repairing damaged surfaces in areas that are inaccessible by ground-based robots.\u2217",

For overcoming the problem of the different poses a person can assume, we exploit the information provided by skeletal tracking algorithms for warping every point cloud frame to a standard pose in real time. Then, the warped point clouds are merged together to compose the model. Re-identification is performed by matching body shapes in terms of whole point clouds warped to a standard pose with the described method. We compare this technique with a classification method based on a descriptor of skeleton features and with a mixed approach which exploits both skeleton and shape features. We report experiments on two datasets we acquired for RGB-D re-identification which use different skeletal tracking algorithms and which are made publicly available to foster research in this new research branch.",

The MASA is designed for safer and more effective physical human-robot interaction with patients in rehabilitation. The MASA consists of cantilever springs, a double-tripod parallel mechanism, and a torque limiter. Using the double-tripod parallel mechanism and two identical actuators, the effective length and the resting position of the cantilever springs are controlled independently. Changes of the effective length of the cantilever springs result in variation of the stiffness of the MASA. One end of each cantilever springs is attached to an axis via the torque limiter. When an external torque beyond the preset threshold is applied from and to the axis, the torque limiter is released so the axis rotates freely regardless of the position of the actuators. The MASA is used for a knee rehabilitation robot. Due to the springs and the torque limiter, physical safety of the patients is guaranteed in case of unexpected involuntary muscle activities (i.e. spasticity) during a therapy session. With changing stiffness of the MASA, the amount of assistance by the robot is possible to be adjusted.",

We present a collection of handheld RGB-D camera sequences within synthetically generated environments. RGB-D sequences with perfect ground truth poses are provided as well as a ground truth surface model that enables a method of quantitatively evaluating the final map or surface reconstruction accuracy. Care has been taken to simulate typically observed real-world artefacts in the synthetic imagery by modelling sensor noise in both RGB and depth data. While this dataset is useful for the evaluation of visual odometry and SLAM trajectory estimation, our main focus is on providing a method to benchmark the surface reconstruction accuracy which to date has been missing in the RGB-D community despite the plethora of ground truth RGB-D datasets available.",

In this paper, a two-dimensional body weight support system extension is presented which reduces lateral forces induced on the subject by means of linearly translating the cable pulley according to lateral movements of the subject. It is demonstrated that the system accurately tracks lateral movements of the pelvis at different levels of vertical support load and thereby lowers the induced lateral forces. The system will be used in advanced robotic body weight supported treadmill walking incorporating a balance training element.",

This lack of interaction with peers leads to emotional problems in children with special needs, behavior disorders, and social maladjustment. These social problems continue even when these children become adults. Hence, it is important to promote social skills at a very early age. In this study, we suggest a new training paradigm for young infants and toddlers seated on mobile robots, using force feedback joystick, to bring them closer to their peers so that it can facilitate interaction. Four healthy children participated in a game as they chase a caregiver. A haptic force feedback strategy teaches how to follow the caregiver. The force feedback guidance strategy is tested as a training tool to bring the children in close proximity to their peers.",

Here, the paper presents a comparative study on electromyography (EMG) pattern recognition based on PCA and LDA for an anthropomorphic robotic hand. Four channels of surface EMG (sEMG) signals were recorded from the subject's forearm. Time-domain analysis, frequency-domain analysis, wavelet transform analysis, nonlinear entropy analysis and fractal analysis were done and fourteen kinds of features were extracted from sEMG signals. The features were divided into four groups, and the performances of the four groups were compared and analyzed. In the feature projection stage, three schemes were proposed and their performances were compared with each other. The first one only used the principal component analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction. And the second one only used the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for dimension reduction. The third one used PCA for the first step of dimensionality reduction, and then used LDA for the next step of dimensionality reduction. In the classification stage, minimum distance classifier (MDC) was employed for identifying nine kinds of hand/wrist motions in the projected space. Comparative experiments of four groups of features and three projection schemes were done and evaluated. The online experiment of real-time myoelectric control for an anthropomorphic robotic hand was done as well.",

The current state of the art in RO SLAM is mainly focused on the filtering approach, while the study of smoothing approach with RO sensors is quite incomplete. This paper presents a comparison between a filtering algorithm, the EKF, and a smoothing algorithm, the SAM (Smoothing And Mapping). Experimental results are obtained, first in an outdoor environment using two types of RO sensors and then in an indoor environment with WiFi sensors. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the smoothing approach with WiFi sensors in indoors.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of quickly building the 3D model of an outdoor environment from measurements obtained by a robot equipped with a solar panel. The robot knows the angle of the sun and the locations of the objects in the environment. It does not know, however, the height of the objects. For example, it might be possible to use satellite images to obtain locations of trees in a field but not their heights. In order to compute the height of an object, the robot must find the projection of the object's highest point. This is where the shadow of the object ends. The robot can find it by tracing the shadow (moving parallel to the sun) until the measurement switches from shadow to sun or vice versa. The robot's goal is to compute the height of every object as quickly as possible using only solar measurements. We formulate this as an online optimization problem. The optimal offline algorithm is given by the Traveling Salesman path of the transition points. The robot does not know these locations a priori. It must search for each of them. We present an algorithm with the property that for n objects, our distance traveled is guaranteed to be within a factor O(log n) of this optimal offline tour. In addition to analytical proofs, we demonstrate the algorithm with simulations using solar data collected from field experiments, and examine its performance for uniformly distributed sites.",

The input for our algorithm is an environment represented as a doubly-connected edge list and the initial positions of the pursuers. The output is a joint strategy for the pursuers that guarantees that the evader has been captured, or a statement that no such strategy exists. We create a Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition(CAD) of the joint configuration space by using polynomials that capture where critical changes can occur to the region of the environment hidden from the pursuers. Then after computing the adjacency graph for the CAD we construct a Pursuit Evasion Graph(PEG) induced by the adjacency graph. A search through the PEG can produce one of the following outcomes; the search can reach a vertex where the pursuers' motions up to this point ensure that the evader has been captured, or the search terminates without finding a solution and produces a statement recognizing that no solution exists.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A novel compliant robot is proposed for traversing on unstructured terrains. The robot consists of modules, each containing a link and an active wheel-pair, and neighboring modules are connected using a passive joint. This type of robots are lighter and provide high durability due to the absence of link-actuators. However, they have limited climbing ability due to tendency of tipping over while climbing big obstacles. To overcome this disadvantage, the use of compliant joints is proposed in this work. Stiffness of each compliant joint is estimated by formulating an optimization problem with an objective to minimize link joint moments while maintaining static-equilibrium. This is one of the key novelties of the proposed work. A design methodology is also proposed for developing an n-module compliant robot for climbing a given height on a known surface. The efficacy of the proposed formulation is illustrated using numerical simulations of the three and five module robots. The robot is successfully able to climb maximum heights upto three times and six times the wheel diameter using three and five modules, respectively. A working prototype was developed and the simulation results were successfully validated on it.",

Tendon routing and joint stiffnesses are designed to provide ease of closure while maintaining finger rigidity, allowing the hand to pinch small objects, as well as secure large objects, without diminishing strength. While the hand is designed to grasp a range of objects, the addition of light suction flow to the fingertips is especially effective for small, low-friction (slippery) objects. Numerical simulations confirm that changing suction parameters can increase the object acquisition region, providing guidelines for future versions of the hand.",

In particular, this study quantifies the effect of the relative phase between wing degrees of freedom \u03b4 on lift and drag production. The computational model also identifies unsteady effects such as wake capture and downwash that are not accounted for in classical quasi-steady models. To examine the accuracy of our computational model, we fabricate millimeter-scale wings through the SCM fabrication processes and measure flapping kinematics and dynamics. The experiments show 2D computational model is 44% more accurate than the quasi-steady model and can be further used to improve wing morphology for better aerodynamic performance.",

We modify this static model to be usable in time-crucial real-world scenarios by applying methods for optimization from signal detection theory, information theory, signal processing and linear algebra. Our system is more robust to clutter and supports object localization by approaching the binding problem in contrast to previous models. We show that our model outperforms the preceding model and that by our modifications we created a robust and fast system which integrates the capabilities of biological-inspired object recognition in a technical application.",

Firstly, the problem of a previously proposed dynamic model, average dynamic model, is analyzed. It shows that the effectiveness of the average dynamic model is limited to robots under a certain class of configurations. To overcome this problem, we first derive the switching conditions of MY wheel-II. Then a continuous dynamic modeling method, using adaptive continuous curves instead of the real discontinuous contact radius in the discontinuous dynamic model, is proposed based on the switching conditions. The resulting dynamic model is a smooth NLPV model, which may then be used as one solution for the model-based control design. The effectiveness of the proposed NLPV model is verified and compared through open-loop simulations against the average model.",

The proposed frequency-based approach offers a dynamic and robust solution able to adapt to changes in the area size and robot capabilities, and even to total robot failures. The algorithm can run properly under communication constraints and there is no robot which rules the others.

It relies on the distributed model predictive control framework to coordinate, in an optimal way, several objectives. The effectiveness of this control technique to maintain postural stability of a biped against strong external disturbances is shown. Control of the horizontal dynamics of the center of mass can withstand limited perturbations. Thus postural stability criteria are specified with respect to the robot center of mass vertical and horizontal dynamics, and to the angular dynamics of its torso. Formulating the balance problem in a predictive form and distributing at different time scales significantly increases the robustness of the system to external disturbances, in terms of both tip-over and slippage risks. This original control architecture is validated through the simulation of an iCub robot performing a walking activity under unknown external actions.",

We propose an uncalibrated Lyapunov-based algorithm that iteratively estimates the deformation Jacobian matrix, with no prior knowledge of the deformation and camera models. With this new method we show how, by combining pose information of the grippers with several visual measurements, we can independently control elastic deformations of unknown objects. We report experiments with a 6-DOF robot manipulator to validate this control approach.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The in-situ exploration of small Solar System bodies (such as asteroids or comets) is becoming a central objective for future planetary exploration. Such bodies are characterized by very weak gravitational fields, which make hopping mobility platforms one of the preferred mobility strategies for microgravity surface exploration, as recognized by space agencies worldwide. However, little is known about the dynamical behavior of hopping platforms in low gravity environments, where small bodies' rotational dynamics can have a critical effect. Accordingly, the objective of this paper is to study in detail the \u201cdynamic envelope\u201d of hopping microgravity rovers, with a focus on internal actuation. Specifically, we first perform a static analysis with the goal of determining regions of a small body where an internally-actuated hopping rover can stably remain at rest. Then, we perform a dynamic analysis and discuss the actuation and instrument pointing performance of hopping microgravity platforms as a function of a number of system and environmental parameters (e.g., rover shape, body rotation rate). Finally, we tailor our analysis to a potential mission to Mars' moon Phobos. Collectively, our results show that internally-actuated rovers, from an actuation standpoint, are a viable mobility solution for a vast class of small Solar System bodies. Also, our analysis represents a key first step to develop path planning algorithms for microgravity explorers to safely explore dynamically feasible regions.",

        "abstract": "A Personal Robot should be able to handle unknown objects in unknown environments. For a manipulation task the question what to do with an object once it had been grasped is one of the most essential ones beside the grasping task itself. Moreover, the planning time should be at least as fast as the time the robot needs for its motions. We propose a fast placement planner for sensor-modelled objects in complex environments. The planner computes a stable position and orientation for the object in the environment. The algorithm uses only geometric information, most notably no force or torque sensor is required. In particular, we introduce a novel approach regarding the pose computation. By means of experiments with various household objects the robustness and performance are validated. Further on, we compare our approach with a pose computation using a physics simulation framework.",

We compared a number of state-of-the-art 2D and 3D feature descriptors to be used with our signature on two newly acquired public datasets for people re-identification with RGB-D sensors. Moreover, we tested our approach against the best re-identification methods in the literature and on a widely used public video surveillance dataset. Our approach proved to be robust to strong illumination changes and occlusions. It achieved very high performance also on low resolution images, overcoming state-of-the-art methods in terms of recognition accuracy and efficiency. These features make our approach particularly suited for mobile robotics.",

The validity of the verification depends on the coverage metric. But not all state spaces can be specified in a simulation. Model checking can overcome the shortcomings of simulation, because all of the state spaces can be traversed. Robot control system is an important part of the robot, used in the control of the manipulator to perform specific tasks. Therefore, in this paper a verification framework is presented for design correctness of robotic manipulator, which combines simulation and model checking. The framework is also applied to other control system or control hardware. Model checking guides the generating of test vectors, and makes the functional coverage reach 100% quickly. In this paper, a manipulator designed with six degrees of freedom is verified. The results of the verification of the manipulator show that the verification framework is effective for checking the design correctness of robotic manipulator.",

Since the human motions in a daily life consist of multiple phases, such as walking, sitting and standing, controllers for assistive robots are required to be able to cope with different motion phases. For this reason, hybrid control which is able to occasionally switch control algorithms according to the motion phases has been preferred in the assistive robots, in particular wearable robots. In this paper, a generalized control framework is proposed as a fundamental framework for the hybrid assistive control and its stability is analyzed using the framework.

        "abstract": "Known as \u201cthe art of strokes\u201d, Chinese calligraphy expresses its aesthetic through the strokes. A calligraphy learner practise the strokes and compose a calligraphic character by the strokes thereafter. Following the same process, the calligraphy robot, Callibot [2] needs to extract the strokes from a character. Therefore, we propose an approach to extract strokes using the geometric properties on the contour(s) of a character. A key discovery is that if two strokes intersect, the contour is concave; otherwise it is convex. The curvature vector defined in [1] is used to locate the vertexes whose interior angles are greater than 180\u00b0 (these vertexes are named as C-points). C-points separate the contours into sub-contours. The corresponding sub-contours then form the basic strokes (i.e. dot stroke, horizontal stroke, vertical stroke, left-falling stroke and right-falling stroke). The experimental results show that this approach is feasible of extracting strokes from characters. This research is also useful for Chinese character recognition and calligraphic styles classification.",

More specifically, we consider the problem of making the end-effector of a planar manipulator attached to a nonholonomic mobile platform reach a set-point or equivalently follow a given path in workspace by means of kinematic actuation. A switched control strategy allows the robot to avoid singular joint configurations and execute a pseudo-inverse based feedback using bounded and continuous control signals. The switching scheme is also utilized to maintain feasible joint configurations. Numerical examples provide an intuitive understanding of the algorithm's workings.",

The natural human tendency to increase arm stiffness to stabilize motion increases the overall stiffness and reduces stability. Controllers commonly address this with increased damping, which slows the device and decreases operator efficiency. Previous research designed a system to estimate operator arm stiffness by measuring muscle activity and compensate accordingly, modifying the robot's motion based on operator interactions. This achieved the goal of reducing oscillations and increasing performance, but encountered drawbacks related to the unpredictable way in which humans modulate the dynamic parameters of their arm. Controllers designed to be robust to stochastic variation of system parameters are explored, and their effectiveness is validated experimentally. This could further increase the operator performance and reduce fatigue, which could translate into better efficiency and higher productivity.",

In the proposed approach, we first employ the LHOP to learn hierarchical part libraries which represent entity parts and compositions across different object categories and views. Then, we extract statistical and geometric features from the part realizations of the objects in the images in order to represent the information about object pose and category at each different layer of the hierarchy. Unlike the traditional approaches which consider specific layers of the hierarchies in order to extract information to perform specific tasks, we combine the information extracted at different layers to solve a joint object pose estimation and categorization problem using distributed optimization algorithms. We examine the proposed generative-discriminative learning approach and the algorithms on two benchmark 2-D multi-view image datasets. The proposed approach and the algorithms outperform state-of-the-art classification, regression and feature extraction algorithms. In addition, the experimental results shed light on the relationship between object categorization, pose estimation and the part realizations observed at different layers of the hierarchy.",

Based on RPDM and superpixels, initial seeds are selected in an unsupervised way, and the seed superpixels iteratively try to occupy their neighbors according to GrowCut framework, the road segment is obtained after convergency. Finally, we refine the road segment with a conditional random field (CRF), which enforces the shape prior on the road segmentation task.

However, there are some flaws when describing a complex task by decomposing it into Manipulation Primitives. For instance, the relations between the individual Manipulation Primitives cannot be captured by the original definition but have to be defined in additional glue code. This contribution introduces an extended definition of Manipulation Primitives to describe manipulation tasks as hierarchical structures using Manipulation Primitives at each level of the hierarchy. Additionally, a concept for a generic control architecture is presented which is capable of meeting the requirements of the extended Manipulation Primitive concept and which can be easily plugged\u201c together using modular code blocks.\u201d",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes using hierarchical wavelets as a basis in parametric continuous-time batch estimation. The need for a continuous-time robot pose in the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem has arisen as state-of-the-art batch SLAM algorithms attempt to handle more challenging hardware; specifically, the continuous-time framework is particularly beneficial when using high-rate sensors, multiple unsynchronized sensors, or scanning sensors, such as lidar and rolling-shutter cameras, during motion. Although the traditional discrete-time SLAM formulation can be adapted by using temporal pose interpolation, approaches using the continuous-time framework are able to generate smooth robot trajectories with less state variables. In this paper, we focus on the parametric approach using temporal basis functions to develop a finite-element representation of the continuous-time robot trajectory. While the majority of current implementations have utilized a uniformly spaced B-spline basis, we note that trajectory richness is often quite variable; in this paper, we show how a hierarchical system of wavelet basis functions can be used to increase the resolution of the solution only in the temporally local regions of the trajectory that require additional detail. We validate our approach by contrasting uniform B-splines and wavelets in a six-dimensional pose-graph SLAM experiment, using both simulated and real data.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a control system platform architecture developed for multi-degrees of freedom (DoFs) robots capable of highly dynamic movements. In robotic applications that require rapid physical interactions with the environment, it is critical for the robot to achieve a high frequency synchronization of data processing from a large number of high-bandwidth actuators and sensors. To address this important problem in robotics, we developed a control system architecture that effectively utilizes the advantages of modern parallel real-time computing technologies: multicore CPU, the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), and distributed local processors. This approach was implemented in the fast running experiments of the MIT Cheetah. In such a highly dynamic robot, the required control bandwidth is particularly high since the MIT Cheetah's leg actuation system is designed to generate high force (output torque up to 100Nm) with high bandwidth (400Hz electrical, 120Hz mechanical) with minimal mechanical impedance for fast locomotive capability. On the integrated control system, a multi-layered architecture is programmed. Inspired by the MapReduce model and the pipelining method, more than 50 processes are operated in parallel, and major processes among them are optimized to achieve the maximum throughput. The proposed architecture enables the control update frequency 4 kHz. With this control system platform, we achieved a high-force proprioceptive impedance control [1], and a trot-running up to 6 m/s with a locomotion efficiency rivaling animals [2]. This control system architecture is well suited for the future trend towards real-time computing system and, thus can be a candidate for a future standard robot control platform.",

This paper presents a global feature-less scan registration strategy based on the ground surface, which is extremely common in Mobile Robotic Mapping scenarios. The 3D rotation is decoupled from 3D translation by transforming the input scans into the Hough domain, wherein Phase Only Matched Filtering (POMF) is adopted for the partially overlapped signal registration. No particular features in the input data are prerequisite to our algorithm. The algorithm is validated by the challenging scans captured by our custom-built platform and a public dataset. The result illustrates the reliability of this algorithm to align feature-less, partially overlapped and noisy scans.",

In order to model such soft systems, we propose to use the Mobile Multibody System framework introduced in [1], [2], [3]. In such a framework, the robot is considered as a tree-like structure of rigid bodies where the evolution of the position of the joints is governed by stress-strain laws or control torques. Based on the Newton-Euler formulation of these systems, we propose a new algorithm able to compute at each step of a time loop both the net and passive joint accelerations along with the control torques supplied by the motors. To illustrate, based on previous work [4], the proposed algorithm is applied to the simulation of the hovering flight of a soft flapping-wing insect-like robot (see the attached video).",

Additionally, we consider that thrust reversal is not available. We present the design of a hybrid controller that, under some given assumptions, is able to globally asymptotically stabilize the vehicle to a reference position trajectory while minimizing the angle to the desired attitude trajectory. This objective is achieved robustly and globally, in the sense that small perturbations do not lead to instability and it is achieved regardless of the initial state of the vehicle. The algorithm is tested in a experimental setup, using a small scale quadrotor vehicle and the VICON motion capture system.",

Given an environment represented as a graph and a Boolean variable for each vertex to represent its inclusion/exclusion on the path, we consider the problem of finding the shortest path (or tour) in the graph subject to a Boolean satisfiability (Sat) formula defined over the vertex variables. We call this problem Sat-Tsp. We show the expressiveness of this language for specifying complex motion planning objectives in a discrete environment. We then present three solution techniques for this problem, including a novel reduction to the well known travelling salesman problem (Tsp). We present extensive simulation results which compare the performance of the three solvers on standard benchmarks from Tsp, Sat, and Generalized Tsp (Gtsp) literature.",

As a practical application of the proposed approach, we present a sensor fusion pedestrian detection system for safe navigation of UGVs in driving environment.

It is assumed each robot only has access to local sensing information (i.e. the relative positions and IDs of its neighbors). Taking into consideration physical sensing constraints (e.g. limited sensing range) and the motion of the robots over time, it may be noted that the sensing graph for the system is directed and time-varying. This presents a challenging situation for formation control. As an initiative attempt to study this challenging situation, we suppose the sensing graph switches among a family of graphs with certain connectivity properties, under which a switching linear control law is then proposed. We show that for arbitrary dwell times or average dwell times, the proposed control law with properly designed control parameters can ensure global convergence to a desired formation shape. The proposed formation control law can be implemented in a distributed manner while the design of certain control parameters requires some global information.",

A manipulator with limited degrees of freedom and differential constraint mobility, together with the large dimensions of the machine, requires reliable visual feedback (pallet pose) and navigation from relatively large distances. It has been shown that the problem can be divided into two parts in order to solve the related issues based on path following theories and visual servoing. Moreover, visual pallet detection is non-real-time and unreliable, especially due to large distances, unfavorable vibrations, and fast steering. To address these issues, we introduce a simple and efficient method that integrates the vision output with odometry and realizes a smooth and nonstop transition from global navigation to visual servoing. Real-world implementation on a small-sized forklift demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed macro-micro architecture.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a general manipulation planner for dual-arm industrial manipulators. According to the context, the planner automatically determines whether both arms have to be used simultaneously or not. The approach is based on (i) the extension of an object placement algorithm previously developed in [23], and (ii) the introduction of several types of re-grasping motions dedicated to dual-arm manipulators. Such motions induce a special topological structure in the manipulation space that can be captured into a manipulation graph. The graph is then used to solve the manipulation problem by a simple graph search algorithm. After searching for a solution path, we further consider optimizing the path by minimizing the number of re-grasps. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on the dual-arm manipulator HiroNX working in a realistic factory environment.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a methodology for capturing the tacit knowledge of the manual grinding and polishing process. Key Process Variables (KPVs) i.e. contact force, tool path, feed rate, etc. of the manual operator performing the task are captured with a `sensorised' hand-held belt grinder, while the changes to the work-piece geometry is captured using a 3-D laser scanner. These KPVs are fed into an analytical material removal model to generate a material removal profile, which can then be calibrated using the actual material removed determined from the manual surface finishing process. The skill of the surface finishing skill is encapsulated in this material removal model and reduces the need for costly robotic Design of Experiment (DoE) trials with test coupons to develop empirical material removal models. Parts from the production process require different processing variables, but the common objective is to generate various material removal maps in order to manufacture a part of a desired form and dimension. The metal removal rate (MRR) model could then be utilized by the industrial robot to determine suitable polishing parameters to accomplish the polishing task. The characteristics of the skilled worker's captured motions can then be extracted and used for optimization of the industrial robot polishing tool path.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "As the end-effector pose is an external property of a parallel robot, it is natural to use exteroceptive sensors to measure it in order to suppress inaccuracies coming from modelling errors. Cameras offer this possibility. So, it is possible to obtain higher accuracy than in the case of classic control schemes (based on geometrical model). In some cases, it is impossible to directly observe the end-effector, but the leg directions can instead be used. In this case, however, unusual results were recorded, namely: (i) the possibility of controlling the robot by observing a number of legs less than the total number of legs, and that (ii) in some cases, the robot does not converge to the desired end-effector pose, even if the observed leg directions did. These results can be explained through the use of the hidden robot concept, which is a tangible visualisation of the mapping between the observed leg direction space (internal property) and Cartesian space (external property). This hidden robot has different assembly modes and singular configurations from the real robot, and it is a powerful tool to simplify the analysis of the aforementioned mapping. In this paper, the concept of hidden robot model is generalised for any type of parallel robot controlled through visual servoing based on observation of the leg directions. Validation has been accomplished through experiments on a Quattro robot with 4 dof.",

When it encounters a large obstacle compared to its size, it can stand up and leap over the obstacle. The robot has a mass of 25 grams and a maximum size of 9 centimeters. Experimental results show that with a take-off angle 80\u00b0, the robot can jump up to 1.44 meter in height and 0.59 meter in distance. Moreover, it has on-board energy, control, and communication abilities, which enables tetherless or autonomous operation. With the multi-modal locomotion abilities, the robot is expected to have many applications ranging from environmental monitoring, search and rescue, to military surveillance.",

In wireless networks, one way to improve this reliability is to choose the best among the available wireless links. For this purpose, an accurate link quality model is required. We show how a group of robots can exploit their mobility to effectively and rapidly learn such a model directly from an unknown environment. The LQE (Link Quality Estimation) protocol, which is used by the robots to cooperatively collect labeled link quality samples, and learn out of them, is presented in the paper. The accuracy and the robustness of the LQE approach are validated through a set of real-world experiments, performed with mobile robots operating in different network environments. Moreover, in simulation, we study a multi-robot coordination problem, and show the benefits of using the link quality learning approach, at the expenses of devoting little time for learning the model before executing the task.",

The pose of the target object is estimated with a P3P algorithm and optimized by minimizing the reprojection error. Since the system works in the infrared spectrum, it is robust to cluttered environments and illumination changes. In a variety of experiments, we show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we successfully apply our system to stabilize a quadrotor both indoors and outdoors under challenging conditions. We release our implementation as open-source software.",

Using a composite laminate batch fabrication process with biocompatible constituent materials, we have fabricated a fully-integrated, 10\u00d710 mm three-axis force sensor with up to 5 V/N sensitivity and RMS noise on the order of ~1.6 mN, operational over a range of -500 to 500 mN in the x- and y-axes, and -2.5 to 2.5 N in the z-axis. Custom foil-based strain sensors were fabricated in parallel with the mechanical structure, obviating the need for post-manufacturing alignment and assembly. The sensor and its custom-fabricated signal conditioning circuitry fit within a 1\u00d71\u00d72 cm volume to realize a fully-integrated force transduction platform with potential haptics and control applications in minimally-invasive surgical tools. The form factor, biocompatibility, and cost of the sensor and signal conditioning makes this method ideal for rapid-prototyping low-cost, mm-scale distal force sensors. Sensor performance is validated in a simulated tissue palpation task using a robotic master-slave platform.",

        "abstract": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia is the most common symptomatic disease in men. A new transurethral surgical intervention is available that has been shown to reduce bleeding, catheterization time, and hospitalization time in comparison to traditional Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). However, this new procedure, Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate (HoLEP), is so challenging to accomplish that only a small number of expert surgeons are able to offer it. Toward facilitating broader use of HoLEP, we propose a new hand-held robotic system for the purpose of making the surgery easier to perform. In current HoLEP, the only way to aim the laser and/or manipulate tissue is to move the entire endoscope, stretching a large quantity of tissue. In contrast, our new robotic approach provides the surgeon with two concentric tube manipulators that can aim the laser and manipulate tissue simultaneously. The manipulators are deployed through a 5 mm working channel in a 26 French (8.66 mm) endoscope clinically used for transurethral procedures. This paper describes the design of the robot and experiments illustrating its ability to perform the motions expected to be useful in HoLEP.",

        "abstract": "Robotic systems have the potential to assist vitre-oretinal surgeons in extremely difficult surgical tasks inside the human eye. In addition to reducing hand tremor and improving tool positioning, a robotic assistant can provide assistive motion guidance using virtual fixtures, and incorporate real-time feedback from intraocular force sensing ophthalmic instruments to present tissue manipulation forces, that are otherwise physically imperceptible to the surgeon. This paper presents the design of an FBG-based, multi-function instrument that is capable of measuring mN-level forces at the instrument tip located inside the eye, and also the sclera contact location on the instrument shaft and the corresponding contact force. The given information is used to augment cooperatively controlled robot behavior with variable admittance control. This effectively creates an adaptive remote center-of-motion (RCM) constraint to minimize eye motion, but also allows the translation of the RCM location if the instrument is not near the retina. In addition, it provides force scaling for sclera force feedback. The calibration and validation of the multifunction force sensing instrument are presented, along with demonstration and performance assessment of the variable admittance robot control on an eye phantom.",

We revised our earlier motion and observation models for active sensors (i.e., radars and LIDARs) and introduced a vision sensor. In the new system, the vision module detects pedestrians, bicyclists, and vehicles to generate corresponding vision targets. Our system utilizes this visual recognition information to improve a tracking model selection, data association, and movement classification of our earlier system. Through the test using the data log of actual driving, we demonstrate the improvement and performance gain of our new tracking system.",

        "abstract": "Natural language interfaces for robot control aspire to find the best sequence of actions that reflect the behavior intended by the instruction. This is difficult because of the diversity of language, variety of environments, and heterogeneity of tasks. Previous work has demonstrated that probabilistic graphical models constructed from the parse structure of natural language can be used to identify motions that most closely resemble verb phrases. Such approaches however quickly succumb to computational bottlenecks imposed by construction and search the space of possible actions. Planning constraints, which define goal regions and separate the admissible and inadmissible states in an environment model, provide an interesting alternative to represent the meaning of verb phrases. In this paper we present a new model called the Distributed Correspondence Graph (DCG) to infer the most likely set of planning constraints from natural language instructions. A trajectory planner then uses these planning constraints to find a sequence of actions that resemble the instruction. Separating the problem of identifying the action encoded by the language into individual steps of planning constraint inference and motion planning enables us to avoid computational costs associated with generation and evaluation of many trajectories. We present experimental results from comparative experiments that demonstrate improvements in efficiency in natural language understanding without loss of accuracy.",

The new robot is the 6-DOF extension of the Cartesian parallel robot. It consists of three pairs of base-mounted prismatic actuators, the directions in each pair parallel to one of the axes of a Cartesian coordinate system. In each of the six legs, there are also two passive revolute joints, the axes of which are parallel to the direction of the prismatic joint. Finally, each leg is attached to the mobile platform via a spherical joint. The direct kinematics of the novel parallel robot can be solved easily by partitioning the orientation and the position of the mobile platform. There are eight distinct solutions, which can be found directly by solving a linear system and alternating the signs of three radicals. This parallel robot has a large workspace and is suitable for machining or rapid prototyping, as detailed in this paper.",

        "abstract": "Walking mechanics has been studied for a long time, being essentially simple but nevertheless including quite tricky aspects. During walking, muscular forces are needed to support body weight and accelerate the body, thereby requiring a metabolic demand. In this paper, a new Constant Pushing Force Device (CPFD) is presented. Based on a novel actuation concept, the device is totally passive and is used to apply a constant force to the pelvis of a subject walking on a treadmill. The device is a serial manipulator featuring springs that provide gravity balancing to the device and exert a constant force regardless of the pelvis motion during walking. This is obtained using only two extension springs and no auxiliary links, unlike existing designs. A first experiment was carried out on a healthy subject to experimentally validate the device and assess the effect of the external force on gait kinematics and timing. Results show that the device was capable of exerting an approximately constant pushing force, whose action affected subject's cadence and the motion of the hip and ankle joints.",

An important issue in some of the works that combine the two approaches is finding the right balance between backtracking at the symbolic level versus at the geometric planning level. We present in this work a new approach to interleaved backtracking, where the symbolic planner backtracks to try alternative action branches that naturally map to different geometric solutions. This eliminates the need to \u201cprotect\u201d certain symbolic conditions when backtracking at the geometric level, and addresses a completeness issue in our previous approach to interleaved backtracking. We discuss a concrete, non-trivial symbolic-geometric planning example in the context of Human-Robot Interaction, a full implementation of the combined planning technique, and an evaluation of performance as well as the effect of increasing the symbolic-action branching factor.",

        "abstract": "To enhance the safety of a humanoid robot when it is operating a complex environment, a number of methods that combine visual and force information have been presented. These methods are generally divided into two approaches. The first approach is to coordinate the visual controller and force controller in a parallel way, and the second approach is to coordinate them in series. However, these two approaches do not consider the interaction between the visual controller and force controller. Specifically, the first approach does not consider the interaction between the controllers. The second approach only considers the effect of the output of the visual controller on the force controller, while the effect of the force controller on the visual controller is not considered. This study presents a design for a new flexible controller for a humanoid robot that considers the interaction of visual and force information. The advantages of the proposed method are that it simultaneously incorporates the functions of a visual servo controller and a flexible controller as well as its ability to consider the interaction of visual and force information when a humanoid robot is operating.",

        "abstract": "Binaural sound source localization is an important technique in friendly Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) for its easy-implementation with only two microphones. This paper develops a robust method based on a hierarchical probabilistic model. Reliable frequency sub-bands are used to PHAT \u2014 \u03c1\u03b3 method in the first layer to obtain a priori crude Interaural Time-Delay (ITD) and the probabilistic distribution of candidate azimuths. The second layer utilizes Interaural Intensity Difference (IID) to reduce matching time and refine candidate azimuths as well as elevations. A novel feature named Interaural Matching Filter (IMF), which can eliminate the difference between ITDs and IIDs, is proposed in the third layer. The probability of sound source location is acquired by computing the similarity between the IMF of received binaural signal and the IMFs in templates. Finally, combined with the former ITDs and IIDs, the similarity matrix is used to make a decision of sound source location based on a Bayes rule. Our innovation lies in adding selecting reliable frequency components into time-delay estimation and foremost taking IMF as a feature of sound source. Compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms, experimental results show our approach has a better performance even in noisy environments without increasing storages, and also has less time complexity.",

Indeed, recent papers still identify difficult parameters (the bulk modulus and the flow gain coefficients) by trial and error. This paper is the first report to solve this problem. First, new structural properties of hydraulic robots are found in comparison with electric robots and then the drawbacks of the conventional methods are discussed. Second, by modifying one of the conventional methods, a scientific method is proposed and applied to an actual hydraulic manipulator. Third, the validity of the proposed method is confirmed by model validation. Remarkably, the difficult parameters are identified very well without any trial and error. The proposed method is applicable to electric robots even on the unknown inclination.",

Besides, an analytical direct geometric model can be easily established which is a rare feature in parallel robots. The paper introduces the novel mechanism with its inverse and direct geometric models as well as its kinematic models (forward and inverse Jacobians). Also, it discusses its singularity analysis and presents sample workspace plots evaluated based on isotropic performance regarding velocity and static force.",

Conversely, only a few microfabrication technologies are adequate for developing small size mechanisms with safe operation in the human body.

In this paper, we explore a new approach, motivated by a medical robotic application framework. The system is statically balanced, in any configuration. Its actuation results from a controllable modification of the balancing. This notably limits the interaction forces between the robot and its environment, but yet authorizes important features like accurate positioning or tracking while in contact, which are key characteristics for the application. In this paper, the robotic device principle is introduced, together with its original actuation, which is developed and experimentally assessed for a one DOF system. Capabilities such as trajectory tracking in the free space, reaction to unexpected collision and tracking of a moving environment are reported. The generalization to more DOF, as required to complete medical tasks, is also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Wearable motion tracking systems represent a breakthrough in ecological motion tracking. Their effectiveness has been proved in many fields, from performance assessment to human-robot interaction. Most of the approaches are based on the exploitation of optimal probabilistic filtering of inertial motion units (IMUs) signals, ranging from linear Kalman Filters (KF) to Particle filters (PF). Since most of the models are highly nonlinear, filters such as Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) are typically used. These approaches cause all the variables of the models to be correlated each other. Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) are a framework for probabilistic reasoning that allows to explicitly declare the actual dependencies among variables. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for motion tracking with IMUs based on PGM. The model is compared to the state of the art UKF algorithm in tracking the human upper limb. The results show that the proposed approach perform a slightly better compared to the UKF.",

Two cruising modes and three turning modes are presented. Results show that the boat cruises forward steadily.

In this paper, we propose a novel robust template matching method to track and follow body targets, which include tumors and stones for the NIUTS. The proposed novel robust template matching method could be applied to a motion tracking of the real human kidney based on the ultrasound images, which is the first successful report as far as I know. This robust visual servoing method could be a great tool to treat the tumors and stones precisely and safely.",

A novel joint-velocity decomposition scheme that complements and avoids some drawbacks of a previous study based on the Singularity-Consistent method is introduced. As a result, it becomes possible to follow almost any singular path in workspace, including paths passing through bifurcations (nondegenerate singular paths). Further on, the algorithmic singularity introduced in the previous study (the \u201cinner obstacle\u201d) disappears in the new formulation. The problem of wrist singularity is also addressed and solved via a proper self motion component. Only a limited subset of singular paths cannot be handled with the method: those that pass through the double elbow-wrist singularity (an isolated point at the workspace boundary). The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated via numerical simulations.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this work, we present a methodology for enabling a robot to identify an object and grasp configuration of interest and assist the human teleoperating the robot, to grasp the object. The identification is carried out in real-time by detecting the motion intention of the human as they are teleoperating the remote robotic arm towards the object and the grasp configuration. Simultaneously, depending on the detected object and grasp configuration, the human user is assisted to translate and orient the remote arm gripper in order to preshape and grasp the object. The complete process occurs with the human teleoperating the arm, and without them having to interact with another interface. Motion intention recognition is carried out by using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), trained offline by preshape trials performed by a skilled teleoperator. The environment is unstructured and comprises of a number of objects, each with multiple grasp configurations. Experimental tests on healthy human subjects have validated our intention recognition based assistance method. They show that the method allows objects to be grasped and placed 48% faster, and with much ease compared to unassisted teleoperation. Moreover, we have proved that the model for intention recognition, trained by a skilled teleoperator, can be used by novice users to efficiently execute a grasping task in teleoperation.",

        "abstract": "Current surgical tele-manipulators do not provide explicit haptic feedback during soft tissue palpation. Haptic information could improve the clinical outcomes significantly and help to detect hard inclusions within soft-tissue organs indicating potential abnormalities. However, system instability is often caught by direct force feedback. In this paper, a new approach to intra-operative tumor localization is introduced. A virtual-environment tissue model is created based on the reconstructed surface of a soft-tissue organ using a Kinect depth sensor and the organ's stiffness distribution acquired during rolling indentation measurements. Palpation applied to this tissue model is haptically fed back to the user. In contrast to previous work, our method avoids the control issues inherent to systems that provide direct force feedback. We demonstrate the feasibility of this method by evaluating the performance of our tumor localization method on a soft tissue phantom containing buried stiff nodules. Results show that participants can identify the embedded tumors; the proposed method performed nearly as well as manual palpation.",

The proposed micro-robot is composed of a permanent magnet with oblique magnetization, and the electromagnetic actuation (EMA) system consists of only two pairs of Helmholtz coils arranged at a right angle on a horizontal plane. While conventional systems generally use the magnetic field gradient for the propulsion, the proposed system uses only a uniform magnetic field. By virtue of these strategies, we can make the system smaller and reduce the power consumption compared to the pre-existing EMA systems. To verify the feasibility of the proposed system, basic experiments and trajectory tracking were performed under different environments.",

        "abstract": "Transmissions play a vital role in machines by transforming the torque and speed of a motor into a desired output. They are often necessary for operating a motor at peak efficiency or power. The majority of variable transmissions are mechanically complex, large, and expensive, which limits scalability and is often cost prohibitive. As an alternative, we propose an origami-wheel design that is capable of varying its own transmission ratio between motor torque and ground reaction force, effectively creating a passive, continuously variable transmission. The wheel responds to an increase in torque by reducing its radius through the spring-like properties of the origami structure, increasing the force applied by the wheel to the ground. We demonstrate that the wheel is able to match the speed of a 55 mm fixed-radius wheel when unloaded, and can also tow loads as high as a 25 mm wheel without stalling. This design could be used to provide smaller, cheaper robots with an effective means to vary their output while maintaining motor efficiency.",

        "abstract": "When designing a robot for human-safety during direct physical interaction, one approach is to size the robot's actuators to be physically incapable of exerting damaging impulses, even during a controller failure. Merely lifting the arms against their own weight may consume the entire available torque budget, preventing the rapid and expressive movement required for anthropomorphic robots. To mitigate this problem, gravity-counterbalancing of the arms is a common tactic; however, most designs adopt a shoulder singularity configuration which, while favorable for simple counterbalance design, has a range of motion better suited for industrial robot arms. In this paper we present a shoulder design using a novel differential mechanism to counterbalance the arm while preserving an anthropomorphically favorable singularity configuration and natural range-of-motion. Furthermore, because the motors driving the shoulder are completely grounded, counterbalance masses or springs are easily placed away from the shoulder and low in the torso, improving mass distribution and balance. A robot arm using this design is constructed and evaluated for counterbalance efficacy and backdrivability under closed-loop force control.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a passivity based compliance stabilizer for humanoid robots. The proposed stabilizer is an admittance controller that uses the force/torque sensing in feet to actively regulate the compliance for the position controlled system. The low stiffness provided by the stabilizer permits compliant interaction with external forces, and the active damping control guarantees the passivity by dissipating the excessive energy delivered by disturbances. Both the theoretical work and simulation validations are presented. The effectiveness of the stabilizer is demonstrated by the simulations of a simplified cart-table model and the multi-body model of a humanoid under impulsive/periodic force perturbations during standing and walking in place. Simulation data show the quantitative evaluation of the stabilization effect by comparing the responses of body attitude, center of mass, center of pressure without and with the stabilizer.",

        "abstract": "Recent technological advancements in cardiovascular surgery such as transapical transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TA-TAVI) enabled treatment to elderly that were initially declined surgery. However, valve malpositioning during TA-TAVI have been reported in several cases. In this preliminary study, we present a novel approach in which a Robotically-Actuated Delivery Sheath (RADS) is used to potentially facilitate valve positioning. A model is developed that describes the shape and articulating tip position of the RADS. We developed a two-dimensional ultrasound tracking method that evaluates the tip position of the RADS in ultrasound images. Both modeling and ultrasound tracking are combined into an integrated system that facilitates closed-loop control of the articulating tip of the RADS. Experiments are performed in order to evaluate the tracking accuracy of the RADS. Experiments show mean positioning errors of approximately 2 mm along the x- and y-axes. Our study demonstrates that the RADS can potentially provide compensation for beating heart and respiratory motions during valve positioning and deployment in TA-TAVI.",

        "abstract": "Cleaning is widely regarded as one of the most relevant applications of autonomous service robots. The goal of robotic cleaning is to achieve low dirt levels in the whole environment. Low cost consumer robots, however, are typically prone to high motion and sensor uncertainties. Additionally, their cleaning units do not always remove the dirt entirely. As a result, there is a substantial probability that some parts of the environment are not cleaned sufficiently. In this paper, we propose an approach to robotic cleaning that guarantees that in the whole environment, the dirt levels after cleaning are reduced below a user-defined threshold with high confidence. We introduce a novel probabilistic model for jointly estimating the trajectory of the robot and the current dirt distribution in the environment. Based on this estimate, we adapt the future cleaning path during operation such that the robot re-visits areas in which high dirt levels are still likely. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in extensive experiments carried out both in simulation and with a real vacuum cleaning robot, also in comparison to previous approaches.",

        "abstract": "The problem of inferring human behaviour is naturally complex: people interact with the environment and each other in many different ways, and dealing with the often incomplete and uncertain sensed data by which the actions are perceived only compounds the difficulty of the problem. In this paper, we propose a framework whereby these elaborate behaviours can be naturally simplified by decomposing them into smaller activities, whose temporal dependencies can be more efficiently represented via probabilistic hierarchical learning models. In this regard, patterns of a number of activities typically carried out by users of an ambulatory aid device have been identified with the aid of a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM) framework. By decomposing the complex behaviours into multiple layers of abstraction the approach is shown capable of modelling and learning these tightly coupled human-machine interactions. The inference accuracy of the proposed model is proven to compare favourably against more traditional discriminative models, as well as other compatible generative strategies to provide a complete picture that highlights the benefits of the proposed approach, and opens the door to more intelligent assistance with a robotic mobility aid.",

For the purpose of accurate control, recent works have pointed out that is not possible to rely completely on analytical models of the stiffness characteristics of the transmissions/joints and that an on-line estimation of stiffness is often mandatory. Building on our previous results, we present a new method to estimate the stiffness based only on input-output signals, without any knowledge of motor parameters nor the need of joint torque sensing. In addition, a Recursive Least Squares method based on a QR decomposition (QR-RLS) is used, which is very robust to poor excitation conditions. In order to deal more efficiently with noisy signals, a combination of two filtering actions is also considered, with a causal Kinematic Kalman Filter (KKF) and a non-causal Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter. Simulation results and comparison with two other state-of-the-art stiffness estimators are presented.",

        "abstract": "The design and control of quadruped robots has become a fascinating research field because they have better mobility on unstructured terrains. Until now, many kinds of quadruped robots were developed, such as JROB-1 [1], BISAM [2], BigDog [3], LittleDog [4], HyQ [5] and Cheetah cub [6]. They have shown significant walking performance. However, most of them use serial mechanism legs and have animal like structure: the thigh and the crus. To swing the crus in swing phase and support the body's weight in stance phase, a linear actuator is attached on the thigh [2, 3, 5, 6], or instead, a rotational actuator is installed on the knee joint [1, 4]. To make the robot more useful in the wild environment, e.g., the detection or manipulation tasks, the payload capability is very important. To carry the sensors or tools, heavy load legged robot is very necessary. Thus the knee actuator should be lightweight, powerful and easy to maintain. However, this can be very costly and hard to satisfy at the same time. This video introduces our lately developed quadruped robot. It is named as \u201cBaby Elephant\u201d because of the heavy load capability and the elephant like appearance. The leg is a serial-parallel hybrid mechanism that is one novelty of our robot. On the sagittal plane, it is a parallel mechanism consisting of two symmetrical crossed limbs. Each leg has three active DOFs, driven by three hydraulic actuators mounted on the hip. To guarantee the sufficient workspace of the leg (i.e., the spatial range that the foot tip can reach) during the walking, the leg structure parameters are optimized. Springs are attached to the legs to reduce the impact and save energy. Using the pressure sensors on hydraulic actuators, it is possible to estimate the ground forces without extra foot force sensors. Comparing with its serial mechanism counterpart, this leg has neither actuator nor sensor on the lower part of the leg. Thus the leg's inertia becomes lower. Moreover, it is easy to protect elec...

In this paper, we propose a novel method to minimize average motion blur captured by such mobile visual sensors. To this end, we derive a motion blur metric (MMBM) that can be computed in real-time by using only inertial sensor measurements and validate it through comparisons with optic flow computations. The applicability of MMBM is illustrated through a motion blur minimizing system implemented on the SensoRHex hexapod robot by externally triggering an onboard camera based on MMBM values computed in real-time while the robot is walking straight on a flat surface. The resulting motion blur is compared to motion blur levels obtained with a regular, fixed frame-rate image acquisition schedule by both qualitative inspection and using a blind blur metric on captured images. MMBM based motion blur minimization system not only reduces average motion blur, but also avoids frames with extreme motion blur before an image gets corrupted by appropriately delaying the triggering of frame acquisition.",

        "abstract": "Astronauts must go through extensive training of their tasks in a simulated microgravity or reduced-gravity environment before they can perform the same tasks in space. Scientists and engineers also need simulated reduced-gravity facilities to study human performance and factors in space. This paper presents a novel design and prototype test of a multi-DOF reduced-gravity simulator which can be used for training astronauts and studying human factors in zero or partial gravity environment. Designed based on the passive static balancing technology, the simulator can passively compensate the gravity force applied to a human to any level from 0 to 100% at all the configurations within its workspace. Therefore, a person attached to the simulator can biomechanically feel like he/she were in a real reduced-gravity environment while doing a physical activity such as walking or jumping. A prototype of the simulator was developed to study the feasibility and dynamic performance of the system. The prototype study demonstrated the reduced-gravity simulation capability of the system. It also revealed some interesting findings which motivate further research in the future.",

We show how to use this representation with two types of motion planners: 1) optimal discrete planners, which are suitable for low-dimensional problems, 2) sampling-based planners that plan in high-dimensional cost spaces. In both cases, our representation allows us to formulate a cost function that directly assesses the cost of deformation without expensive physical simulation or computation of deformed geometry. We show that our methods can generate paths that minimize deformation in both simulated and physical environments with either hard and soft robots in either hard and soft environments. The efficiency of our representation allows these paths to be computed in under 20s for 3-DOF problems. For more complicated 6-DOF problems, low-deformation paths can be computed in under 120s. Additionally, using feedback from simulated and physical test environments, we demonstrate methods for calibrating models based on our representation.",

        "abstract": "A wearable robot secured on the shoulder of a human is developed for assisting its wearer in the execution of tasks in the overhead workspace. Installing a ceiling panel is an example of such a task. During this task the robot can hold the panel or collaborate actively with the human in order to fix the panel with the appropriate equipment. This wearable robot, termed \"Supernumerary Robotic Limbs\", works closely with the human to streamline the operation and reduce the human workload. First, the design concept of the Robot-on-the-Shoulder system is described, and a new approach to the coordinated control between the wearable robot and the human is presented. A graphical task process representation based on Coloured Petri Nets (CPN) is used to model the concurrent and distributed nature of the human-robot system, which comprises two human hands and two robot hands. The CPN framework is then extended to a type of hybrid control system by imbedding local dynamic controllers in the Transition nodes of the CPN model. Each local dynamic controller collects sensor signals relevant to the target transition and makes a predictive control decision. This allows the robot on the shoulder to take a proactive and preemptive action as well as to confirm a successful Transition. The control parameters for these algorithms are tuned based on \"teaching-by-showing\" techniques using human demonstration data. Partial Least Squares is used for extracting significant sensor signals from high-dimensional sensor data in order to do real time predictions and control. A prototype robot-on-the-shoulder system is built, and the CPN hybrid control is implemented and tested for a ceiling panel installation task.",

        "abstract": "Motion sensors as inertial measurement units (IMU) are widely used in robotics, for instance in the navigation and mapping tasks. Nowadays, many low cost micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS) based IMU are available off the shelf, while smartphones and similar devices are almost always equipped with low-cost embedded IMU sensors. Nevertheless, low cost IMUs are affected by systematic error given by imprecise scaling factors and axes misalignments that decrease accuracy in the position and attitudes estimation. In this paper, we propose a robust and easy to implement method to calibrate an IMU without any external equipment. The procedure is based on a multi-position scheme, providing scale and misalignments factors for both the accelerometers and gyroscopes triads, while estimating the sensor biases. Our method only requires the sensor to be moved by hand and placed in a set of different, static positions (attitudes). We describe a robust and quick calibration protocol that exploits an effective parameterless static filter to reliably detect the static intervals in the sensor measurements, where we assume local stability of the gravity's magnitude and stable temperature. We first calibrate the accelerometers triad taking measurement samples in the static intervals. We then exploit these results to calibrate the gyroscopes, employing a robust numerical integration technique. The performances of the proposed calibration technique has been successfully evaluated via extensive simulations and real experiments with a commercial IMU provided with a calibration certificate as reference data.",

The planner uses sampling-based techniques and game-theoretic approaches to generate a series of plans and decision choices that increase the chances of success within a fixed time budget. The planning algorithm consists of two phases: exploration and strategy improvement. During the exploration phase, a search tree is grown in the hybrid state space by sampling state and control spaces for a fixed amount of time. An initial strategy is then computed over the search tree using a game-theoretic approach. To mitigate the effects of nondeterminism in the initial strategy, the strategy improvement phase extends new tree branches to the goal, using the data that is collected in the first phase. The efficacy of this planner is demonstrated on simulation of two hybrid and nondeterministic car-like robots in various environments. The results show significant increases in the likelihood of success for the strategies computed by the two-phase algorithm over a simple exploration planner.",

In this scheme, the control loop does not close periodically, but instead a self-triggering framework decides when to provide the next control update. Between two consecutive triggering instants, the control sequence computed by the NMPC is applied to the system in an open-loop fashion, i.e, no state measurements are required during that period. This results to a significant smaller number of requested measurements from the vision system, as well as less frequent computations of the control law, reducing in that way the processing time and the energy consumption. The image constraints (i.e preserving the target inside the camera's field of view), the external disturbances induced by currents and waves, as well as the vehicle's kinematic constraints due to under-actuation, are being considered during the control design. The closed-loop system has analytically guaranteed stability and convergence properties, while the performance of the proposed control scheme is experimentally verified using a small under-actuated underwater vehicle in a test tank.",

        "abstract": "We present the development of a semi-autonomous quadrotor UAV platform for indoor teleoperation using RGB-D technology as exceroceptive sensor. The platform integrates IMU and Dense Visual Odometry pose estimation in order to stabilize the UAV velocity and track the desired velocity commanded by a remote operator though an haptic interface. While being commanded, the quadrotor autonomously performs a persistent pan-scanning of the surrounding area in order to extend the intrinsically limited field of view. The RGB-D sensor is used also for collision-safe navigation using a probabilistically updated local obstacle map. In the operator visual feedback, pan-scanning movement is real time compensated by an IMU-based adaptive filtering algorithm that lets the operator perform the drive experience in a oscillation-free frame. An additional sensory channel for the operator is provided by the haptic feedback, which is based on the obstacle map and velocity tracking error in order to convey information about the environment and quadrotor state. The effectiveness of the platform is validated by means of experiments performed without the aid of any external positioning system.",

        "abstract": "In this article we address the problem of minimal pose under the framework of the generalized camera models. Previous approaches were based on geometric properties, such as the preservation of distance between points. In this paper we propose a novel formulation of the problem using an algebraic-based approach. We represent the pose by a 3\u00d73 matrix. Using both the algebraic relationship between three incident 3D points and straight lines and the underlying constraints of the pose matrix, pose can be computed. In terms of experimental results, the main contribution of the proposed method is the robustness to critical configurations. In addition, a full comparison and analysis between state-of-the-art methods is made (so far, there is no published comparison between state-of-the-art methods published).",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an odometer architecture which combines a monocular camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The trifocal tensor geometry relationship between three images is used as camera measurement information, which makes the proposed method without estimating the 3D position of feature point. In other words, the proposed method does not have to reconstruct environment. Meanwhile, the camera pose corresponding to each of the three images are refined in filter to form a multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF). Consequently, this paper proposes a sliding window odometry which has a balance between computational cost and accuracy. Compared with traditional visual odometry or simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method, the proposed method not only meets the requirement of odometer in the ego-motion estimation, but also suit for real-time application. This paper further proposes a random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm which is based on three views geometry. The RANSAC algorithm can effectively reject feature points which are mismatch or located on independently moving objects, thus it make the overall algorithm capable of operating in dynamic environment. Experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method in real environment.",

A key feature of the device is the two-dimensional design of the elastomer muscles that not only allows the compactness of the device, but also significantly simplifies the manufacturing process. In addition, the fabric sleeves make the device lightweight and easily wearable. The elastomer muscles were characterized and demonstrated an initial contraction force of 38N and maximum contraction of 18mm with 104kPa input pressure, approximately. Four elastomer muscles were employed for assisted knee extension and flexion. The robotic device was tested on a 3D printed leg model with an articulated knee joint. Experiments were conducted to examine the relation between systematic change in air pressure and knee extension-flexion. The results showed maximum extension and flexion angles of 95\u00b0 and 37\u00b0, respectively. However, these angles are highly dependent on underlying leg mechanics and positions. The device was also able to generate maximum extension and flexion forces of 3.5N and 7N, respectively.",

        "abstract": "We present a soft, amorphous skin that can sense and localize textures. The skin consists of a series of sensing and computing elements that are networked with their local neighbors and mimic the function of the Pacinian corpuscle in human skin. Each sensor node samples a vibration signal at 1 KHz, transforms the signal into the frequency domain, and classifies up to 15 textures using logistic regression. By measuring the power spectrum of the signal and comparing it with its local neighbors, computing elements can then collaboratively estimate the location of the stimulus. The resulting low-bandwidth information, consisting of the texture probability distribution and its location are then routed to a sink anywhere in the skin in a multi-hop fashion. We describe the design, manufacturing, classification, localization and networking algorithms and experimentally validate the proposed approach. In particular, we demonstrate texture classification with 71% accuracy and centimeter accuracy in localization over an area of approximately three square feet using ten networked sensor nodes.",

        "abstract": "Map consistency is an important requirement for applications in which mobile robots need to effectively perform autonomous navigation tasks. While recent SLAM techniques provide an increased robustness even in the context of bad initializations or data association outliers, the question of how to determine whether or not the resulting map is consistent is still an open problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel measure for map consistency. We compute this measure by taking into account the discrepancies in the sensor data and leverage it to address two important problems in SLAM. First, we derive a statistical test for assessing whether a map is consistent or not. Second, we employ it to automatically set the free parameter of dynamic covariance scaling, a robust SLAM back-end. We present an evaluation of our approach on over 50 maps sourced from 16 publicly available datasets and illustrate its capability for the inconsistency detection and the tuning of the parameter of the back-end.",

In this paper, we study three robot models with different leg actuation designs by means of highly detailed multibody system dynamics simulation. For this purpose, we first elaborate on the term of energy-efficient and dynamic two-legged hopping and present a performance index. Subsequently we conduct the same experimental setup for passive rebound and soft landing for all models. Among others it is observed that (1) the envisioned dynamic and energy-efficient locomotion cannot be achieved through stiff actuation, (2) the energy restitution can be maximized without sacrificing the dynamic mobility and (3) such passive rebound experiments are well suited to determining the optimal leg actuation design.",

        "abstract": "Robust, accurate pose estimation and mapping at real-time in six dimensions is a primary need of mobile robots, in particular flying Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), which still perform their impressive maneuvers mostly in controlled environments. This work presents a visual-inertial sensor unit aimed at effortless deployment on robots in order to equip them with robust real-time Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) capabilities, and to facilitate research on this important topic at a low entry barrier. Up to four cameras are interfaced through a modern ARM-FPGA system, along with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) providing high-quality rate gyro and accelerometer measurements, calibrated and hardware-synchronized with the images. This facilitates a tight fusion of visual and inertial cues that leads to a level of robustness and accuracy which is difficult to achieve with purely visual SLAM systems. In addition to raw data, the sensor head provides FPGA-pre-processed data such as visual keypoints, reducing the computational complexity of SLAM algorithms significantly and enabling employment on resource-constrained platforms. Sensor selection, hardware and firmware design, as well as intrinsic and extrinsic calibration are addressed in this work. Results from a tightly coupled reference visual-inertial motion estimation framework demonstrate the capabilities of the presented system.",

        "abstract": "To propose a synchronous and multi-domain feature extraction method of electroencephalogram (EEG) and surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals is of great significance to power-assist rehabilitation robot control with humancomputer interface (HCI). In this paper, nonnegative Tucker decomposition which is one model of nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) is used to fuse two kinds of bioelectricity signals (EEG and sEMG) and extract multi-domain features of EEG and sEMG signals for classification which contain time, frequency, and space domains. In the first step the EEG and sEMG data are transformed into multidimensional information using continuous wavelet transform and the 4-D EEG-sEMG tensor is established. Then the tensor is decomposed into four components (spatial components, spectral components, temporal components and category components) and the core tensor is the feature extracted. The feature after being eliminated and compressed are fed into KNN, LDA and SVM classifiers for pattern recognition, and a comparison is done in single EEG analysis, single sEMG analysis and both EEG and sEMG analysis. An experiment about 10 healthy participants' upper limb movements was carried out to verify the validity of this algorithm. The result implied that NTF is a meaningful and valuable synchronous and multi-domain feature extraction method which may be promising in power-assist rehabilitation robot control.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The Kleihauer-Betke test (KBT) is a widely used method for measuring fetal-maternal hemorrhage (FMH) in maternal care. In hospitals, KBT is performed by a certified technologist to count a minimum of 2,000 fetal and maternal red blood cells (RBCs) on a blood smear. Manual counting is inherently inconsistent and subjective. This paper presents a system for automated counting and distinguishing fetal and maternal RBCs on clinical KB slides. A custom-adapted hardware platform is used for KB slide scanning and image capturing. Spatial-color pixel classification with spectral clustering is proposed to separate overlapping cells. Optimal clustering number and total cell number are obtained through maximizing cluster validity index. To accurately identify fetal RBCs from maternal RBCs, multiple features including cell size, shape, gradient and saturation difference are used in supervised learning to generate feature vectors, to tackle cell color, shape and contrast variations across clinical KB slides. The results show that the automated system is capable of completing the counting of over 60,000 cells (vs. 2,000 by technologists) within 5 minutes (vs. 15 minutes by technologists). The counting results are highly accurate and correlate strongly with those from benchmarking flow cytometry measurement.",

        "abstract": "We present a task-parameterized probabilistic model encoding movements in the form of virtual spring-damper systems acting in multiple frames of reference. Each candidate coordinate system observes a set of demonstrations from its own perspective, by extracting an attractor path whose variations depend on the relevance of the frame at each step of the task. This information is exploited to generate new attractor paths in new situations (new position and orientation of the frames), with the predicted covariances used to estimate the varying stiffness and damping of the spring-damper systems, resulting in a minimal intervention control strategy. The approach is tested with a 7-DOFs Barrett WAM manipulator whose movement and impedance behavior need to be modulated in regard to the position and orientation of two external objects varying during demonstration and reproduction.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces an optical based three axis force sensor which can be integrated with the robot arm of the EU project STIFF-FLOP (STIFFness controllable Flexible and Learnable Manipulator for Surgical Operations) in order to measure applied external forces. The structure of the STIFF-FLOP arm is free of metal components and electric circuits and, hence, is inherently safe near patients during surgical operations. In addition, this feature makes the performance of this sensing system immune against strong magnetic fields inside magnetic resonance (MR) imaging scanners. The hollow structure of the sensor allows the implementation of distributed actuation and sensing along the body of the manipulator. In this paper, we describe the design and calibration procedure of the proposed three axis optics-based force sensor. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our optical sensing approach and its applicability to determine the force and momentum components during the physical interaction of the robot arm with its environment.",

The gripper has three fingers and is characterised by a large workspace if compared with other similar devices reported in literature. Its kinematic configuration allows to execute both parallel and precision grasps on objects with very different dimensions. The gripper has 8 degrees of freedom actuated by only three motors by means of a suitable coupling of the joints obtained through the cable transmission. Moreover, in order to facilitate the execution of complex tasks, special force/torque sensors are mounted on the fingertips. The paper reports the main specifications deriving from the particular tasks in which the gripper is involved, and illustrates the proposed design solutions. Results obtained from real underwater experiments are provided as well, in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the gripper.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel method to estimate relative poses for a calibrated stereo camera. Three corresponding points in 3D space are theoretically required to recover unconstraint motion which has six degrees of freedom. The proposed method solves this problem with only two 3D points by exploiting a common reference direction between poses. Two points are selected in accordance with the distance to the camera: one distant point is used for deriving a reference direction, and one near point is used for estimating accurate translation. The distance is computed by triangulation in stereo vision. The uncertainty of triangulation can be mitigated by the appropriate selection strategy. The experiments using synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness and higher stability of the proposed method against image pixel noise.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation flight can vastly increase operational range and persistence through autonomous aerial refuelling or efficient flight on a wingman's wake vortices. Differencing individual UAV state estimates is not sufficiently accurate for close formation operations and must be augmented with vehicle-to-vehicle observations. To this end, we propose a quaternion based unscented Kalman filter to fuse information from each UAV sensor suite with relative vision observations. The result is a vastly improved relative state estimate that is resilient to brief vision dropouts and degrades gracefully during extended dropouts. Simulated formation flight results validate the approach and provide a numerical analysis of the algorithm performance. Ground based experiments demonstrate the algorithm running in real-time on a dual-UAV system. This represents a significant step towards an airborne implementation.",

Furthermore, infection due to improper sterilization is a critical safety hazard. To address these problems, we have developed a unique robotic manipulation system that is capable of accurately singulating surgical instruments in a cluttered environment. Our solution is comprised of two parts. First, we use a single-view vision algorithm for identifying surgical instruments from a pile and estimating their poses. Occlusion reasoning is performed to determine the next instrument to grip using a contrast invariant feature descriptor. Second, we design a compliant electromagnetic gripper that is capable of picking up the identified surgical instrument based on its estimated pose. We validate our solution through instrument singulation experiments demonstrating identification, localization accuracy, and robustness of occlusion reasoning as well as the flexibility of the electromagnetic gripper.",

        "abstract": "Onboard power remains a major challenge for miniature robotic platforms. Locomotion at small scales demands high power densities from all system components, while limited payload capacities place severe restrictions on the size of the energy source, resulting in integration challenges and short operating times when using conventional batteries. Wireless power delivery has the potential to allow microrobotic platforms to operate autonomously for extended periods when near a transmitter. This paper describes the first demonstration of RF wireless power transfer in an insect-scale ambulatory robot. A wireless power transmission system based on magnetically coupled resonance is designed for the latest iteration of the Harvard Ambulatory MicroRobot (HAMR), a piezoelectrically driven quadruped that had previously received power through a tether. Custom power and control electronics are designed and implemented on lightweight printed circuit boards that form a part of the mechanical structure of the robot. The integration of the onboard receiver, power and control electronics, and mechanical structure yields a 4cm, 2.1g robot that can operate autonomously in two wireless power transmission scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Although imitation learning is a powerful technique for robot learning and knowledge acquisition from n\u00e4\u0131ve human users, it often suffers from the need for expensive human demonstrations. In some cases the robot has an insufficient number of useful demonstrations, while in others its learning ability is limited by the number of users it directly interacts with. We propose an approach that overcomes these shortcomings by using crowdsourcing to collect a wider variety of examples from a large pool of human demonstrators online. We present a new goal-based imitation learning framework which utilizes crowdsourcing as a major source of human demonstration data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach experimentally on a scenario where the robot learns to build 2D object models on a table from basic building blocks using knowledge gained from locals and online crowd workers. In addition, we show how the robot can use this knowledge to support human-robot collaboration tasks such as goal inference through object-part classification and missing-part prediction. We report results from a user study involving fourteen local demonstrators and hundreds of crowd workers on 16 different model building tasks.",

        "abstract": "Discretely actuated steerable cannula is a multi-degree-of-freedom hollow needle (cannula) that could potentially be used in needle-based procedures to deliver therapeutic and diagnostic tools to a target region through its hollow inner core. Needle-based procedures are commonly performed using intra-operative image guidance. 2D ultrasound is one of the most commonly used imaging modalities in clinics. It is portable, inexpensive and free of ionizing radiation. The success of the needle-based procedures depends on accurate detection of the needle. The accuracy of the out-of-plane detection, where the ultrasound transducer is placed at a right angle to the long-axis of the needle, depends on the ultrasound beam width. Finite width of the ultrasound beam and uniform cross-section of the needle introduce errors in tracking. The accuracy of in-plane tracking depends on the tracking algorithm used and the spatial resolution of the ultrasound transducer. This work presents a method to quantify the finite ultrasound beam width and the spatial accuracy of the transducer. An out-of-plane detection method was implemented to locate the tip of the discretely actuated steerable cannula. An in-plane tracking algorithm based on optical flow was also developed to obtain the shape of a planar cannula. The algorithms and the methods developed in this work are general and they can be extended to needles having straight, curved and arbitrary shapes.",

        "abstract": "In this paper a control strategy for a mobile robot enabling to track a manually driven vehicle or a moving target is proposed in the context of natural environment. In such a context, the motion does not meet classical assumptions usually proposed for mobile robots, since the terrain geometry is not necessarily flat and wheels are subject to sliding. As a result, in order to preserve the accuracy of tracking, it appears necessary to account for such phenomena in the control law. Several observer-based approaches have already been developed in the framework of path following in off-road conditions, but suffer from several limitations. In particular, the velocity should not be null, which appears to be an important drawback in the proposed application: the tracking of a non-autonomous vehicle indeed imposes possible stops. In this paper, a new observation strategy is proposed allowing to avoid non-observable situations (null velocity). This permits to achieve an accurate vehicle tracking whatever its velocity, its trajectory and the grip conditions.",

We derive the 3D velocity fields set up by linear and rotational robot motions and explain how they can be sampled directly by a sonar array-sensor that we developed recently. The resulting acoustic flow field patterns are then shown to contain all the information necessary for controlling obstacle avoidance and corridor following behavior. Experimental data collected by the sonar system mounted on a wheelchair that was driven in an office environment are presented to validate the theoretically predicted acoustic flow patterns.",

        "abstract": "Programming by demonstration (PbD) allows matching the kinematic movements of a robot with those of a human. The presented Continuous Goal-Directed Actions (CGDA) is able to additionally encode the effects of a demonstrated action, which are not encoded in PbD. CGDA allows generalization, recognition and execution of action effects on the environment. In addition to analyzing kinematic parameters (joint positions/velocities, etc.), CGDA focuses on changes produced on the object due to an action (spatial, color, shape, etc.). By tracking object features during action execution, we create a trajectory in an n-dimensional feature space that represents object temporal states. Discretized action repetitions provide us with a cloud of points. Action generalization is accomplished by extracting the average point of each sequential temporal interval of the point cloud. These points are interpolated using Radial Basis Functions, obtaining a generalized multidimensional object feature trajectory. Action recognition is performed by comparing the trajectory of a query sample with the generalizations. The trajectories discrepancy score is obtained by using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Robot joint trajectories for execution are computed in a simulator through evolutionary computation. Object features are extracted from sensors, and each evolutionary individual fitness is measured using DTW, comparing the simulated action with the generalization.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with recognizing human actions in depth video data. Current state-of-the-art action recognition methods use hand-designed features, which are difficult to produce and time-consuming to extend to new modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel, 3.5D representation of a depth video for action recognition. A 3.5D graph of the depth video consists of a set of nodes that are the joints of the human body. Each joint is represented by a set of spatio-temporal features, which are computed by an unsupervised learning approach. However, if occlusions occur, the 3D positions of the joints are noisy which increases the intra-class variations in action classes. To address this problem, we propose the Ensemble Weighted Multi-Instance Learning approach (EnwMi) for the action recognition task. It considers the class imbalance and intra-class variations. We formulate the action recognition task with depth videos as a weighted multi-instance problem. We further integrate an ensemble learning method into the weighted multi-instance learning framework. Our approach is evaluated on Microsoft Research Action3D dataset, and the results show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

We present a constrained optimisation scheme that computes the next best action maximising the trade off between (i) the localisation information gain, (ii) the time required for its computation, and (iii) the motion-execution time. This allows the robot programmer to have a deterministic influence on the length of every sensing action. The proposed methodology is applied to localise a solid object in 3D using a Staubli RX90 robot equipped with a force-torque sensor coupled with a spherical end effector. A case-study comparison of the task executed with two different time constraints is presented.",

        "abstract": "An active Tethered Pelvic Assist Device (A-TPAD) has been presented in this paper. TPAD is a cable robot for studying force adaptation in human walking by applying external forces and moments on the human pelvis. A two stage control strategy was implemented to apply the desired force-moment profile. The controller includes (i) a quadratic programming based optimization scheme, (ii) a real-time human motion monitoring system and (iii) a PID feedback loop to plan and implement the required cable tensions. The control strategy was validated first by testing it on a dummy pelvis setup. A pilot experiment was then conducted with a human walking on a treadmill with A-TPAD. The goal was to apply a vertical downward force vector equivalent to 10% of subject's body weight (BW) at the pelvis. Results showed that the applied vertical force was acting downwards over the full gait cycle and was between 8-13% of the BW. Other force-moment components were maintained within a specified range during the experiment. Increased foot pressure was reported in the presence of vertical force. In summary, A-TPAD provides the capability of applying and controlling a desired force-moment profile on the human pelvis over a gait cycle.",

The active actuation of the agent in \u201cpole support phase\u201d plays important roles in improving vaulting performance. Investigating this actuation can contribute to the design of novel control strategies during the time when the agent contacts with environment through the elastic device. In this study, we specifically examined an active bending effect performed in the \u201cpole support phase.\u201d We analyzed the active bending effect on reachable height (vaulting height) using the \u201cTransitional Buckling Model.\u201d We applied this active bending theory to a robot and verified the active bending effect to improve vaulting height. Results show that active bending motion in the \u201cpole support phase\u201d improves the pole vault performance and that the timing of the bending direction change is an important factor for defining the vaulting performance. These results will facilitate the application of robots using large elasticity.",

For micro operation systems with multiple manipulators, the handling of irregular objects may lead to a nonorthogonal microscopic system, which needs to focus on clear viewing interested features, and it may also hardly locate the exact position and posture of the robot arms. In view of these, this paper proposes an active calibration method to compute image Jacobian matrix, which maps from the relative motion of the manipulators to the image coordination changes in the microscopes. We also investigate the applications in micro operator positioning, tracking for distributed systems, and movement optimization in micro-assembly. Experiments are carried out on a micro-assembly platform equipped with three microscopes and six robot arms, and the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Learning is based on a free mix of exploration and instruction by an external teacher, and may be active in the sense that the system tests actions to maximize learning progress and asks the teacher if needed. The main component is a symbolic planning engine that operates on learned rules, defined by actions and their pre- and postconditions. Learned by model-based reinforcement learning, rules are immediately available for planning. Thus, there are no distinct learning and application phases. We show how dynamic plans, replanned after every action if necessary, can be used for automatic execution of manipulation sequences, for monitoring of observed manipulation sequences, or a mix of the two, all while extending and refining the rule base on the fly. Quantitative results indicate fast convergence using few training examples, and highly effective teacher intervention at early stages of learning.",

        "abstract": "Biomedical applications of micro or nanorobots require active movement through complex biological fluids. These are generally non-Newtonian (viscoelastic) fluids that are characterized by complicated networks of macromolecules that have size-dependent rheological properties. It has been suggested that an untethered microrobot could assist in retinal surgical procedures. To do this it must navigate the vitreous humor, a hydrated double network of collagen fibrils and high molecular-weight, polyanionic hyaluronan macromolecules. Here, we examine the characteristic size that potential robots must have to traverse vitreous relatively unhindered. We have constructed magnetic tweezers that provide a large gradient of up to 320 T/m to pull sub-micron paramagnetic beads through biological fluids. A novel two-step electrical discharge machining (EDM) approach is used to construct the tips of the magnetic tweezers with a resolution of 30 \u03bcm and high aspect ratio of \u223c17:1 that restricts the magnetic field gradient to the plane of observation. We report measurements on porcine vitreous. In agreement with structural data and passive Brownian diffusion studies we find that the unhindered active propulsion through the eye calls for nanorobots with cross-sections of less than 500 nm.",

While passive monocular SLAM strives to reconstruct the scene and determine the current camera pose for any given camera motion, not every camera motion is equally suited for these tasks. In this work we propose methods to evaluate the quality of camera motions with respect to the generation of new useful map points and localization maintenance. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our measures using a low-cost quadrocopter. The proposed system only requires a single passive camera as exteroceptive sensor. Due to its explorative nature, the system achieves autonomous way-point navigation in challenging, unknown, GPS-denied environments.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We present an approach that combines passive scene understanding with object search in order to recognize scenes in indoor environments that cannot be perceived from a single point of view. Passive scene recognition is performed using Implicit Shape Models based on spatial relations between objects. ISMs, a variant of the Generalized Hough Transform, are extended to describe scenes as sets of objects with relations lying between them. Relations are expressed as six-degree-of-freedom (DoF) relative object poses. They are extracted from sensor recordings of human demonstrations of actions usually taking place in the corresponding scene. In a scene ISMs solely represent relations of n objects towards a common reference. Violations of other relations are not detectable. To overcome this limitation, we extend our scene model, using hierarchical agglomerative clustering, to a binary tree consisting of ISMs. Active scene recognition aims to simultaneously detect present scenes and look for objects these scenes consist of. For a pivoting stereo camera rig, we achieve this by performing recognition with ISMs in an object search loop using next-best-view (NBV) estimates. A criterion, on which we greedily choose views the rig shall adopt next, is the confidence to detect objects in them. In each step during the search, confidences on potential positions of objects, not found yet, are calculated based on the best available scene hypothesis. This is done by reversing the principle of ISMs and using spatial relations to predict potential object positions starting from the objects already detected.",

We target applications to rugged environments characterized by complex terrain likely to significantly perturb the robot's nominal dynamics. At the same time, it is crucial that the camera avoid \u201cobstacle\u201d poses where absolute localization would be compromised by even partial loss of landmark visibility. Hence, we seek a controller whose robustness against disturbances and obstacle avoidance capabilities can be assured by a strict global Lyapunov function. Since the nonholonomic constraints preclude smooth point stabilizability we introduce an extra degree of sensory freedom, affixing the camera to an actuated panning axis on the robot's back. Smooth stabilizability to the robot-orientation-indifferent goal cycle no longer precluded, we construct a controller and strict global Lyapunov function with the desired properties. We implement several versions of the scheme on a RHex robot maneuvering over slippery ground and document its successful empirical performance.",

        "abstract": "Structure estimation from motion (SfM) is a classical and well-studied problem in computer and robot vision, and many solutions have been proposed to treat it as a recursive filtering/estimation task. However, the issue of actively optimizing the transient response of the SfM estimation error has not received a comparable attention. In this paper, we provide an experimental validation of a recently proposed nonlinear active SfM strategy via two concrete applications: 3D structure estimation for a spherical and a cylindrical target. The experimental results fully support the theoretical analysis and clearly show the benefits of the proposed active strategy. Indeed, by suitably acting on the camera motion and estimation gains, it is possible to assign the error transient response and make it equivalent to that of a reference linear second-order system with desired poles.",

Guided by information deduced from the human's latest intervening commands, APEX is capable of adapting an arbitrary robot system to dynamic changes in task objectives and conditions during a session. We explore this framework within visual navigation contexts where the humanrobot team is tasked with covering or patrolling over multiple terrain boundaries such as coastlines and roads.

ALEX III is the first treadmill-based rehabilitation robot featuring 12 actively controlled degrees of freedom (DOF): 4 at the pelvis and 4 at each leg. As a first application of the device, we present an adaptive controller aimed to improve gait symmetry in hemiparetic subjects. The controller continuously modulates the assistive force applied to the impaired leg, based on the outputs of kernel-based non-linear filters, which learn the movements of the healthy leg. To test the effectiveness of the controller, we induced asymmetry in the gait of three young healthy subjects adding ankle weights (2.3kg). Results on kinematic data showed that gait symmetry was recovered when the controller was active.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we will study the uncalibrated vision-based positioning problem of wheeled mobile robots by using a ceiling-mounted camera. A new image-based visual servoing scheme will be proposed, which can cope with the unknown intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera and the uncertain distance parameter of the feature point from geometric center of the mobile robot. The presented approach is developed via extending the depth-independent interaction matrix framework for robot manipulators to mobile robots such that the nonlinear dependence on unknown parameters can be removed from the image-Jacobian matrix and then, we can linearly parameterize uncertain parameters in the closed-loop system. In this way, an estimation scheme for the online updating of uncertain parameters can be developed very efficiently. To show that image errors can be guaranteed to be asymptotically convergent, stability analysis will be carried out by using Lyapunov theory. To validate the performance of the presented approach, simulation and experimental results will also be provided.",

        "abstract": "An adaptive synergy controller is presented which allows a dexterous artificial hand to unscrew and screw an object using facial expressions derived from electromyogram (EMG) signals. In preliminary experiments, the finger joint motions of nine human test subjects were recorded as they unscrewed a bottle cap in multiple orientations of their hands with respect to the object. These data were used to develop a set of adaptive sinusoidal joint synergies to approximate the orientation-dependent human motions, which were then implemented on a dexterous robotic manipulator via the proposed adaptive synergy controller. The controller is driven through a noninvasive interface which allows a single input to drive the bioinspired human motions using facial expressions. The adaptive synergy controller was evaluated by four able-bodied subjects who were able to unscrew and screw an instrumented object using the artificial hand in two orientations with a 100% success rate.",

The usage of an industrial manipulator is motivated by practical applications which were identified in different cooperation projects with the industry. We address the coupling between manipulator and helicopter and show that even in case when we have an ideal controller for manipulator and a highperformance controller for helicopter, an unbounded energy flow can be generated by internal forces between helicopter and manipulator if both controllers are used independently. To solve this problem we propose a new kinematical coupling for control by introducing an additional manipulation DoF realized by helicopter rotation around its yaw axis. The new experimental setup and required modifications in the manipulator controller for this purpose are described. Further, we propose dynamical coupling which is implemented by modification of the helicopter controller feeding the interaction force/torque, measured between manipulator base and fuselage, directly to the actuators of the rotor blades. At the end, we present experimental results for aerial manipulation and their analysis.",

The proposed scheme is based on controlling aerodynamic power as opposed to the rotor speed of each motor-rotor system. Electrical properties of the brushless direct current motor are used to both estimate and control the mechanical power of the motor system which is coupled with aerodynamic power using momentum theory analysis. In comparison to current state-of-the-art motor control for multirotor aerial vehicles, the proposed approach is robust to unmodelled aerodynamic effects such as wind disturbances and ground effects. Theory and experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed motor control.",

SMART provides invariance to changes in illumination and vehicle speed while also providing moderate pose invariance and robustness to environmental aliasing. We evaluate SMART on vehicles travelling at highly variable speeds in two challenging environments; firstly, on an all-terrain vehicle in an off-road, forest track and secondly, using a passenger car traversing an urban environment across day and night. We provide comparative results to the current state-of-the-art SeqSLAM algorithm and investigate the effects of altering SMART's image matching parameters. Additionally, we conduct an extensive study of the relationship between image sequence length and SMART's matching performance. Our results show viable place recognition performance in both environments with short 10-metre sequences, and up to 96% recall at 100% precision across extreme day-night cycles when longer image sequences are used.",

Ambient motion is recovered from visual optical flows that represent ego and ambient dynamics. In this paper, each moving object is considered as a rigid body that has been segmented from the background using computer vision algorithms. In motion recovery, the fundamental challenge is to resolve the coupling between scene depths and translational velocities. Ambient rotational velocities are obtained following a depth-independent bilinear constrain. The scales of ambient trans-lational velocities is computed using the proposed dynamics constraint with an assumption that ambient accelerations are negligible. A fix-point optimization scheme is further introduced to iteratively refine the recoveries of translational and rotational ambient motion until an expected precision is achieved or the maximal iteration is reached. During the optimization, translational ambient motion is precisely recovered and translational ambient motion is rescaled to the canonical amplitude. The results of the simulation study show the effectiveness of the proposed method in motion analysis and prediction.",

In this work we propose a novel active strategy in which a monocular camera tries to determine whether a set of observed point features belongs to a common plane, and, if so, what are the associated plane parameters. The active component of the strategy imposes an optimized camera motion (as a function of the observed scene) able to maximize the convergence in estimating the scene structure. Based on this strategy, two methods are then proposed to solve the plane estimation task: a classical solution exploiting the homography constraint (and, thus, almost completely based on image correspondances across distant frames), and an alternative method fully taking advantage of the scene structure estimated incrementally during the camera motion.

This human-sized, three-degree-of-freedom mechanism has a tetrahedral architecture, four cables and evolves in three-dimensional space. A brief review of the kinematics of the mechanism is presented. Also, an admittance control law coupled with a closed-loop velocity controller is proposed. The control method is then refined by introducing adaptations for smooth surfaces and sharp edges. This control method is then validated by experimental results. Furthermore, the geometry of the mechanism is identified by a method that does not require any other sensor than the motor encoders.",

        "abstract": "In the past, highly effective solutions to the SLAM problem based on solving nonlinear optimization problems have been developed. However, most approaches put their major focus on runtime and accuracy rather than on memory consumption, which becomes especially relevant when large-scale SLAM problems have to be solved. In this paper, we consider the SLAM problem from the point of view of memory consumption and present a novel approximate approach to SLAM with low memory consumption. Our approach achieves this based on a hierarchical decomposition consisting of small submaps with limited size. We perform extensive experiments on synthetic and publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that in situations in which the representation of the complete map requires more than the available main memory, our approach, in comparison to state-of-the-art exact solvers, reduces the memory consumption and the runtime up to a factor of 2 while still providing highly accurate maps.",

Although there are many rest area facilities available to truck drivers, there is a lack of persistent timely information on truck parking availability. An automated real-time sensing system to directly detect and disseminate parking space occupancy from truck parking facilities is described in detail. The methodology and system architecture are presented in which robust, persistent, parking occupancy detection is achieved by extending Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques using a multiplicity of commercial, off-the-shelf cameras. The system architecture allows the approach to be scaled to a region-wide comprehensive truck parking information system for commercial heavy vehicle drivers and operators. Per parking space detection accuracy of 99% is achieved over continuous operation. Classification accuracy under diverse scene and parking behavior scenarios is discussed.",

During scheduled activities, the robot is able to interact with a group of users by providing both group-based and individualized assistance based on the current state of the activity and the needs of the individual users engaged in the social interactions. Such planning and scheduling of daily activities of a social robot while reasoning about multiple user schedules has not yet been addressed in the literature. Herein, the HRI multi-user activities we consider are a series of Bingo games. System performance experiments presented in the paper validate the use of the proposed multiuser system architecture in: 1) planning and scheduling daily Bingo games for Tangy to facilitate while considering the individual schedules of the users, and 2) determining the appropriate behaviors of the robot with respect to individuals and groups of people while providing game reminders prior to a Bingo game starting and also while facilitating the game itself.",

        "abstract": "A method to autonomously control multiple environmental cameras, which are currently fixed, for providing more adaptive visual information suited to the work situation for advanced unmanned construction is proposed. Situations in which the yaw, pitch, and zoom of cameras should be controlled were analyzed and imaging objects including the machine, manipulator, and end-point and imaging modes including tracking, zoom, posture, and trajectory modes were defined. To control each camera simply and effectively, four practical camera roles combined with the imaging objects and modes were defined as the overview-machine, enlarge-end-point, posture-manipulator, and trajectory-manipulator. A role assignment system was then developed to assign the four camera roles to four out of six cameras suitable for the work situation, e.g., reaching, grasping, transport, and releasing, on the basis of the assignment priority rules, in the real time. Debris removal tasks were performed by using a VR simulator to compare fixed camera, manual control, and autonomous systems. Results showed that the autonomous system was the best of the three at decreasing the number of grasping misses and error contacts and increasing the subjective usability while improving the time efficiency.",

The biologically-motivated neural networks (BNN) algorithm is employed to guide an autonomous robot to reach goal with obstacle avoidance motivated by Grossberg's model for a biological neural system. As the robot plans its trajectory toward the goal, unreasonable path will be inevitably planned. A vector-based guidance paradigm is developed for guidance of the robot locally so as to plan more reasonable trajectories. In addition, square cell map representations are proposed for realtime autonomous robot navigation. The BNN based scheme demonstrates that the algorithms avoid the issue of local minima in path planning. In this paper, both simulation and comparison studies of an autonomous robot navigation demonstrate that the proposed model is capable of planning more reasonable and shorter collision-free paths in non-stationary and unstructured environments compared with other approaches.",

        "abstract": "Vector-quantization can be a computationally expensive step in visual bag-of-words (BoW) search when the vocabulary is large. A BoW-based appearance SLAM needs to tackle this problem for an efficient real-time operation. We propose an effective method to speed up the vector quantization process in BoW-based visual SLAM. We employ a graph-based nearest neighbor search (GNNS) algorithm to this aim, and experimentally show that it can outperform the state-of-the-art. The graph-based search structure used in GNNS can efficiently be integrated into the BoW model and the SLAM framework. The graph-based index, which is a k-NN graph, is built over the vocabulary words and can be extracted from the BoW's vocabulary construction procedure, by adding one iteration to the k-means clustering, which adds small extra cost. Moreover, exploiting the fact that images acquired for appearance-based SLAM are sequential, GNNS search can be initiated judiciously which helps increase the speedup of the quantization process considerably.",

Recent studies of the problem have led to successful development of methods that are based on images captured by the robot. These methods tackle the issue of efficiency through data structures such as indexing and hierarchical (tree) organization of the image data that represent the robot map. In this paper, we offer an alternative approach and present a novel method for visual loop-closure detection. Our approach uses an extremely simple image representation, namely, a down-sampled binarized version of the original image, combined with a highly efficient image similarity measure - mutual information. As a result, our method is able to perform loop closure detection in a map with 20 million key locations in about 2.38 seconds on a commodity computer. The excellent performance of our method in terms of its low complexity and accuracy in experiments establishes it as a promising solution to loop closure detection in large-scale robot maps.",

The controller solves an optimal control problem using an approximate value function derived from a simple walking model while respecting the dynamic, input, and contact constraints of the full robot dynamics. By exploiting sparsity and temporal structure in the optimization with a custom active-set algorithm, we surpass the performance of the best available off-the-shelf solvers and achieve 1kHz control rates for a 34-DOF humanoid. We describe applications to balancing and walking tasks using the simulated Atlas robot in the DARPA Virtual Robotics Challenge.",

These shapes can be used as the mechanical bodies of robots. The input to this process is a 3D geometry (e.g. an OBJ file). The output is a physical object with the specified geometry. We describe an algorithm pipeline that (1) identifies the overall geometry of the input, (2) computes a crease pattern that causes the sheet to self-fold into the desired 3D geometry when activated by uniform heating, (3) automatically generates the design of a 2D sheet with the desired pattern and (4) automatically generates the design files required to fabricate the 2D structure. We demonstrate these algorithms by applying them to complex 3D shapes. We demonstrate the fabrication of a self-folding object with over 50 faces from automatically generated design files.",

Designs are generated by recursively combining mechanical components \u2014 from primitive building blocks, through mechanisms and assemblies, to full robots \u2014 in a flexible yet well-defined manner. This process was used to design robotic elements of increasing complexity up to a multi-degree-of-freedom compliant manipulator arm, demonstrating the power of this system.

        "abstract": "The design of gaits and corresponding control policies for bipedal walkers is a key challenge in robot locomotion. Even when a viable controller parametrization already exists, finding near-optimal parameters can be daunting. The use of automatic gait optimization methods greatly reduces the need for human expertise and time-consuming design processes. Many different approaches to automatic gait optimization have been suggested to date. However, no extensive comparison among them has yet been performed. In this paper, we present some common methods for automatic gait optimization in bipedal locomotion, and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. We experimentally evaluated these gait optimization methods on a bipedal robot, in more than 1800 experimental evaluations. In particular, we analyzed Bayesian optimization in different configurations, including various acquisition functions.",

However, these manipulators sometimes suffer from the lack of enough stiffness while applied in surgical robotic systems. This paper presents an experimental kinestatic comparison between three continuum manipulators, aiming at revealing how structural variations could alter the manipulators' stiffness properties. These variations not only include modifying the arrangements of elastic components, but also include integrating a passive rigid kinematic chain to form a hybrid continuum-rigid manipulator. Results of this paper could contribute to the development of design guidelines for realizing desired stiffness properties of a continuum or hybrid manipulator.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an expertise-oriented training platform for robotics-assisted minimally invasive surgery. The framework builds on previous work of the authors and makes use of dual-user teleoperation scenario, allowing the presence of an expert in the training loop. A Fuzzy-Logic (FL) methodology is proposed, which specifies the level/mode of the training required for the trainee according to his/her level of proficiency over the task. A major advantage of the proposed FL approach is that, having the expert in the loop, it can specify the trainee's proficiency level relative to that of the expert in real-time. Moreover, based on the relative skills assessment, the proposed FL approach decides if or to what extent the trainee should receive a haptic guidance force based on Virtual Fixtures or the environment force from the interaction between the surgical instrument and tissue at the slave side. In addition to the level/mode of the haptics-enabled training required for the trainee, the proposed FL framework specifies the authority level of the trainees over the operation in real-time, according to their proficiency levels over the task. Stability of the overall closed-loop teleoperated system is also investigated using the small-gain theorem, resulting in a sufficient condition to guarantee stability in the presence of constant communication delays. Finally, experimental results are given to evaluate the design and feasibility of the proposed framework.",

The method assigns a speed profile to each aerial vehicle in real time such that the separation between them is greater than a minimum safety value and the total deviation from the initial trajectories is minimized. The Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) of each aerial vehicle is also taken into account to solve the conflicts. Its computational load and scalability depending on the main parameters of the method are studied. Many simulations have been performed to analyze the best parameters of the method.

In particular we focus on how non-nominal failures in a planning-based system can be detected before actual failure. To investigate, we integrated a system combining an accurate physics-based simulation, robust object recognition and a symbolic planner to achieve realistic prediction of robot actions. A Gazebo simulation was used to reason about and evaluate situations before and during plan execution. The simulation enabled re-planning to take place in advance of actual plan failure. We present a restaurant scenario in which our system prevents plan failure and successfully lets the robot serve a drink on a table cluttered with objects. The results give us confidence in our approach to improving situations where unavoidable abstractions of robot action planning meet the real world.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an improved RRT-based motion planner for autonomous vehicles to effectively navigate in cluttered environments with narrow passages. The planner first presents X-test that can identify passable narrow passages, and then perform an efficient obstacles-based extension operation within passable narrow passages. In order to generate a smooth trajectory for the vehicle to execute, a post-process algorithm with trajectory optimization is proposed. For the purpose of demonstrate benefits of our method, the proposed motion planner is implemented and tested on a real autonomous vehicle in cluttered scenarios with narrow passages. Experimental results show that our planner achieves up to 13.8 times and 7.6 times performance improvements over a basic RRT planner and a Bi-RRT planner respectively. Moreover, the resulting path of our planner is more smooth and reasonable.",

        "abstract": "Wearable inertial tracking is well accepted due to its convenience for free-style motion tracking with high accuracy. Traditionally, complicated high-order calculations for human kinematic modeling and inaccurate estimation of sensor placement are interfering the efficiency of real-time tracking. In order to tackle the challenges, a wearable human motion tracking system is developed by applying twists and exponential maps techniques. When the body segments are articulated by product of exponential maps, joint positions are continuously updated based on these techniques and their rotational angles are represented individually within the global frame. It is more efficient to achieve real-time motion tracking with low-order calculations. Meanwhile by applying the well-designed calibration procedure, it is more convenient to estimate a sensor's position and orientation regardless of knowing its placement. This paper presents our approach and exemplifies the assessment of proposed motion tracking system by several tests of limb and full body motion tracking. The comparisons with Vicon and OptiTrack motion capture systems verify satisfactorily high accuracy.",

Instead of using externally mounted sensors, as required by most ground-truth systems, our approach involves mounting only landmarks consisting of distinct patterns printed on inexpensive foam boards. A pose estimation algorithm computes the pose of the robot with respect to the landmark using the image obtained by an on-board camera. We demonstrate that such an approach is capable of providing accurate estimates of a mobile robot's position and orientation with respect to the landmarks in arbitrarily-sized environments over arbitrarily-long trials. Furthermore, because the approach involves minimal outfitting of the environment, we show that only a small amount of setup time is needed to apply the method to a new environment. Experiments involving a state-of-the-art navigation system demonstrate the ability of the method to facilitate accurate localization measurements over arbitrarily long periods of time.",

However, in many applications, data streams containing the A's and B's will often have different sampling rates or will be asynchronous. For these reasons and the fact that each stream may contain gaps in information, methods that require minimal a priori knowledge of the correspondence between A's and B's would be superior to the existing algorithms that require exact correspondence. We present an information-theoretic algorithm for recovering X from a set of A's and a set of B's that does not require a priori knowledge of correspondences. The algorithm views the problem in terms of distributions on the group SE(3), and minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence of these distributions with respect to the unknown X. This minimization is performed by an efficient numerical procedure that reliably recovers an unknown X.",

In this paper, a complete methodology is proposed that handles the grasping problem under a wide range of uncertainties. Initially, we search for an acceptable posture that provides robustness against positioning inaccuracies and maximizes the ability of the robot hand to exert forces on the object. Subsequently, in order to secure the grasp stability, we also deal with the determination of sufficient contact forces. Finally, an appropriate tactile sensor setup, mounted on the robot hand, allow us to reduce the magnitude of uncertainty regarding the grasping parameters. The efficiency of our approach is validated through extensive experimental paradigms using a 15 DoF DLR/HIT II robotic hand attached at the end effector of a 7 DoF Mitsubishi PA10 robotic manipulator.",

Two different force feedback interfaces are considered: a force feedback joystick and a novel force feedback trackball. The joystick considered is based on the admittance user interface developed by the authors in earlier work and is configured to servo velocity of the vehicle. The force feedback trackball is configured to map vehicle velocity directly to trackball velocity, exploiting the effectively infinite workspace of the trackball to overcome the classical challenge of servo controlling a slave with infinite workspace using a master device with finite workspace. A key contribution of the paper is to provide a modeling framework, based on the bond graph formalism, that allows the energy consistent modeling of input from an admittance joystick as reference to an internal velocity regulation loop for the vehicle. Once this is implemented it is straightforward to interconnect multiple input devices, and in particular the trackball device, using standard interconnection rules in bond graphs. Experiments were performed, and the outcomes verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed interface.",

A computationally lightweight policy gradient method is applied in order to adapt a set of characteristic maneuver parameters, which in turn reduces the expected value of the final state deviation for the next execution of the maneuver. The performance of the learning algorithm is demonstrated in the ETH Zurich Flying Machine Arena by improving the performance of a triple flip.",

We propose a control law based on the gradient field of a Lyapunov function, and give sufficient conditions for global convergence. We show that the well-known Average Landmark Vector method (for which no convergence proof was known) can be obtained as a particular case of our framework. We then derive a sliding mode control law for a unicycle model which follows this gradient field. Both controllers do not depend on range information. Finally, we also show how our framework can be used to characterize the sensitivity of a home location with respect to noise in the specified bearings.",

The kinematic specifications of the perching mechanism are optimized to maximize the force transfer ratio so that sufficient grasping force can be generated for reliable perching. A controller of the gripper based on the control strategy from previous development is designed for autonomous perching with a quadrotor. Experiments on the grasping capability and reliability of the mechanism and its effectiveness with the controller for autonomous perching are conducted. Results show that the perching mechanism can generate sufficient grasping force and achieve autonomous perching to a target pole with a quadrotor both effectively and reliably.",

Moreover, the last decades have seen the rise of (variable) compliant acuators as important elements to perform safe interaction and dynamic tasks. This paper introduces a Variable Stiffness Differential Drive (VSDD), i.e., a differential transmissions with variable stiffness actuators (VSAs), and presents a dynamic analysis. The analysis shows that, when variable stiffness actuators are used in coupled differential transmissions, the allowable stiffness range at the output of the system depends on the position of the springs inside the device. In particular, independent output joint stiffness can be obtained by dislocating the actuation from the elastic elements.",

        "abstract": "Determining an analytical solution to the inverse kinematics problem for a parallel manipulator is typically a straightforward problem. However, lower mobility parallel manipulators with 2-5 degrees of freedom (DOFs) often suffer from an unwanted parasitic motion in one or more DOFs. For such manipulators, the inverse kinematics problem can be significantly more difficult. This paper contains an analysis of the inverse kinematics problem for a class of 3-DOF parallel manipulators with axis-symmetric arm systems. All manipulators in the studied class exhibit parasitic motion in one DOF. For manipulators in the studied class, the general solution to the inverse kinematics problem is reduced to solving a univariate equation, while analytical solutions are presented for several important special cases.",

The goal is to enable a robot to anticipate collaborative actions in the presence of uncertain sensing and task ambiguity. The system can represent multi-path tasks where the task variations may contain partially ordered actions or even optional actions that may be skipped altogether. The task is represented by an AND-OR tree structure from which a probabilistic graphical model is constructed. Inference methods for that model are derived that support a planning and execution system for the robot which attempts to minimize a cost function based upon expected human idle time. We demonstrate the theory in both simulation and actual human-robot performance of a two-way-branch assembly task. In particular we show that the inference model can robustly anticipate the actions of the human even in the presence of unreliable or noisy detections because of its integration of all its sensing information along with knowledge of task structure.",

The main novelty of this work is an approach that combines localization of the robot relative to an object believed to be the target and confirmation of this object's identity. Since the position of the robot relative to the candidate target is never exactly known, we model this position by a probability distribution over a set of cells forming a decomposition of the workspace around the candidate target. By performing a series of moves the robot acquires several images and runs a target detector module on each image. Its goal is not only to reach a position where the target detector can confirm the target with high confidence (as this approach would be prone to false positives). It is also to reach a position where, with high probability, the target detector will confirm with high confidence that the candidate target is actually the target. This twofold goal reduces drastically the likelihood of false positives. The target confirmation problem is modeled as a Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which is solved using Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP).",

        "abstract": "The two main objectives in designing a haptic interface are stability and transparency. The dynamics of the actuators employed in a haptic interface have a significant effect on these goals. In this article, the potential benefits of Magneto-Rheological Fluid (MRF) based actuators to the field of haptics are discussed. Devices developed with such fluids are known to possess superior mechanical characteristics over conventional servo systems. This contributes significantly to improved stability and transparency of haptic devices. In this study, this idea is evaluated from both theoretical and experimental points of view. First, the properties of such actuators which motivated this research are discussed. Next, two single degrees-of-freedom (DOF) haptic interfaces are used in a virtual wall experiment. These devices take advantage of an MRF-based clutch and a brushless DC motor at their core, respectively. The results of both devices are compared and show the superiority of the MRF-based clutch. In addition, design and analysis of a small-scale MRF-based clutch, suitable for a multi-DOF haptic interface, is given and its torque capacity, inertia, and mass are compared with those of conventional servo systems. Conclusions drawn from this investigation indicate that MRF clutch actuation approaches can indeed be developed to design haptic interfaces with improved stability and transparency.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents an overview of our research on accounting for robot pose uncertainty in area coverage applications. In the vast majority of existing literature on robotics area coverage, the location uncertainty of the robot is not considered. An uncertain robot pose results in an uncertain sensor swath, which in turn creates uncertainty about the achieved coverage. Here, we present a general framework where pose estimates are mapped through the coverage sensor model to obtain a probability of coverage over the discretized workspace. This probabilistic representation can then be used to adaptively plan paths for coverage based on an entropy reduction formulation. This framework is particularly well-suited to autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) performing seabed surveying operations. The AUV position estimate diverges from the actual AUV position while submerged due to the lack of a global position reference. This discrepancy can result in parts of the seabed being missed, which is unacceptable in safety-critical missions such as mine countermeasures. The proposed information-based path planning approach is able to guarantee area coverage even in the case of severe AUV position estimate drift. In-water experiments with an AUV show the effectiveness of the method.",

        "abstract": "Alignment of module connectors is a crucial component of self-reconfiguration in modular robotics. Accomplishing this process using passive mechanical geometry saves resources such as space and power for the modular robot. We present concepts for evaluation of these geometries as well as a new 3D geometry, the 3D X-Face. For comparing different connectors independent of the rest of the robot, figures of merit are presented which are based on the ability for connectors to mate in the presence of position and orientation errors (offsets). Figures of merit for many current connectors are presented. The 3D X-Face alignment behavior is simulated in Gazebo over several sets of initial conditions to estimate the full area of acceptance, and the connector is tested on a CKBot robotic platform. For the situation without rotation, results indicate a 27% improvement over current gendered connectors and a 467% over ungendered connectors. The 3D X-Face is further simulated over a full five-dimensional set and metrics are estimated on that set.",

Then, the minimum energy required to assemble the manipulator in the non-assembly zone(s) is computed, while considering link flexibility and joint elasticity. The maximum pose errors of the moving-platform are also computed throughout the manipulator workspace. Finally, a two-dof spatial parallel manipulator, named IRSbot-2, is used as an illustrative example.",

We introduce a generalization that allows for the additional cost incurred by resource contention to be treated in a straightforward manner. In this variant, robots may choose one of shared resources to perform a task, and interference may be modeled as occurring when multiple robots use the same resource. We investigate the general NP-hard problem and instances where the interference results in linear or convex penalization functions. We propose an exact algorithm for the general problem and polynomial-time algorithms for the other problems. The exact algorithm finds an optimal assignment in a reasonable time on small instances. The other two algorithms quickly find an optimal and a high-quality approximation assignment even if a problem is of considerable size. In contrast to conventional approximation methods, our algorithm provides the performance guarantee.",

To this end, we have been developing assistance control for everyday users of cycling wheelchairs. In our previous research, we found that user load varies in different environments. Traveling resistance compensation control proved successful in counteracting in a range of environments. In the user-load investigation on cycling wheelchairs, the crank torque generated by pedaling was observed to be problematic for hemiplegic patients, who must pedal mainly with their healthy side. Futhermore, for patients able to bend one leg only, because the opposite limb is stiffened at the knee joint or physically absent, the cycling wheelchair is difficult to maneuver. This paper focuses on the crank torque during one-leg-pedaling and proposes a new assistance control.",

        "abstract": "We present Lower Bound Tree-RRT (LBT-RRT), a single-query sampling-based algorithm that is asymptotically near-optimal. Namely, the solution extracted from LBT-RRT converges to a solution that is within an approximation factor of 1 + \u03b5 of the optimal solution. Our algorithm allows for a continuous interpolation between the fast RRT algorithm and the asymptotically optimal RRT* and RRG algorithms. When the approximation factor is 1 (i.e., no approximation is allowed), LBT-RRT behaves like the RRT* algorithm. When the approximation factor is unbounded, LBT-RRT behaves like the RRT algorithm. In between, LBT-RRT is shown to produce paths that have higher quality than RRT would produce and run faster than RRT* would run. This is done by maintaining a tree which is a sub-graph of the RRG roadmap and a second, auxiliary tree, which we call the lower-bound tree. The combination of the two trees, which is faster to maintain than the tree maintained by RRT*, efficiently guarantee asymptotic near-optimality. We suggest to use LBT-RRT for high-quality, anytime motion planning. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm for scenarios ranging from 3 to 12 degrees of freedom and show that even for small approximation factors, the algorithm produces high-quality solutions (comparable to RRT*) with little runtime overhead when compared to RRT.",

The decoupling is performed according to the principle of regarding the attitude motion as a virtual input of the lateral longitudinal flight dynamics. This allows the attitude and flight controllers to be designed individually without mutual interference. Considering that dynamics of the ducted fan UAV is uncertain, an estimation method of system function based on the smooth saturation function and the state variable integral is proposed. This method has the advantage of less computation while keeping the high estimation performance. The stability analysis and the simulation results showing the practical feasibility of the proposed control scheme to ducted fan UAVs are given.",

        "abstract": "Localization is one of the key challenges that needs to be considered beforehand to design truly autonomous MAV teams. In this paper, we present a cooperative method to address the localization problem for a team of MAVs, where individuals obtain their position through perceiving a sound-emitting beacon MAV that is flying relative to a reference point in the environment. For this purpose, an on-board audio-based localization system is proposed that allows individuals to measure the relative bearing to the beacon robot and furthermore to localize themselves and the beacon robot simultaneously, without the need for a communication network. Our method is based on coherence testing among signals of a small on-board microphone array, to obtain the relative bearing measurements, and an estimator, to fuse these measurements with sensory information about the motion of the robot throughout time, to estimate robustly the MAV positions. The proposed method is evaluated both in simulation and in real world experiments.",

        "abstract": "Keyword spotting (KWS) deals with the identification of keywords in unconstrained speech, which is a natural, straightforward and friendly way for human-robot interaction (HRI). Most keyword spotters have the common problem of noise-robustness when applied to real-world environment with dramatically changing noises. Since visual information won't be affected by the acoustic noise, it can be utilized to complementarily improve the noise-robustness. In this paper, a novel audio-visual keyword spotting approach based on adaptive decision fusion under noisy conditions is proposed. In order to accurately represent the appearance and movement of mouth region, an improved local binary pattern from three orthogonal planes (ILBP-TOP) is proposed. Besides, a parallel two-step recognition based on acoustic and visual keyword candidates is conducted and generates corresponding acoustic and visual scores for each keyword candidate. Optimal weights for combining acoustic and visual contributions under diverse noise conditions are generated using a neural network based on reliabilities of the two modalities. Experiments show that our proposed audio-visual keyword spotting based on decision fusion significantly improves the noise robustness and attains better performance than feature fusion based audiovisual spotter. Additionally, ILBP-TOP shows more competitive performance than LBP-TOP.",

        "abstract": "Cable-actuated systems provide an effective method for precise motion control over various distances. Motion control using such systems has traditionally focused on eliminating longitudinal resonances and disturbance. Moreover, longitudinal cable resonances are usually assumed to be at much higher frequencies compared to transverse resonances, ensuring minimal coupling between the two. However, in high-speed high-precision applications, the coupling between longitudinal and lateral cable oscillations cannot be ignored in the presence of high-inertia components. In this paper, we describe the mechanism of auto-parametric resonance in cable-pulley systems through which longitudinal vibrations can couple strongly to transverse vibrations. We model exact dynamics of coupled cable-pulley oscillations and solve them numerically to observe the intrinsic non-linear behavior. Preliminary experimental results show the effect of this coupling on pulley rotation.",

To achieve this goal, not only the actions and objects have to be shown to the robot, but also the effect of the action needs to be estimated. Recognizing the subtle assembly actions is a non-trivial task, and it is difficult to estimate the effect of the action on the assembly parts due to the small part sizes. In this paper, with a RGB-D camera, we build a Portable Assembly Demonstration (PAD) system which can recognize the part/tool used, the action applied and the assembly state characterizing the spatial relationship between the parts. The experiment results proved that this PAD system can generate an assembly script with good accuracy in object and action recognition as well as assembly state estimation.",

        "abstract": "Most mammalian cells (e.g., cancer cells and cardiomyocytes) adhere to a culturing surface. Compared to robotic injection of suspended cells (e.g., embryos and oocytes), fewer attempts were made to automate the injection of adherent cells due to their smaller size, highly irregular morphology, small thickness (a few micrometers thick), and large variations in thickness across cells. This paper presents a recently developed robotic system for automated microinjection of adherent cells. The system is embedded with several new capabilities: automatically locating micropipette tips; robustly detecting the contact of micropipette tip with cell culturing surface and directly with cell membrane; and precisely compensating for accumulative positioning errors. These new capabilities make it practical to perform adherent cell microinjection truly via computer mouse clicking in front of a computer monitor, on hundreds and thousands of cells per experiment (vs. a few to tens of cells as state-of-the-art). System operation speed, success rate, and cell viability rate were quantitatively evaluated based on robotic microinjection of over 4,000 cells. This paper also reports the use of the new robotic system to perform cell-cell communication studies using large sample sizes. The gap junction function in a cardiac muscle cell line (HL-1 cells), for the first time, was quantified with the system.",

Controlled self-assembly and dynamic reconfiguration of large ensembles of microscopic particles can effectively bridge these domains to build innovative systems. In this perspective, we present SelfSys, a novel platform for the automated control of the fluidic self-assembly of microparticles. SelfSys centers around a water-filled microfluidic chamber whose agitation modes, induced by a coupled ultrasonic actuator, drive the assembly. Microparticle dynamics is imaged, tracked and analyzed in real-time by an integrated software framework, which in turn algorithmically controls the agitation modes of the microchamber. The closed control loop is fully automated and can direct the stochastic assembly of microparticle clusters of preset dimension. Control issues specific to SelfSys implementation are discussed, and its potential applications presented. The SelfSys platform embodies at microscale the automated self-assembly control paradigm we first demonstrated in an earlier platform.",

However, the characterization of three dimensional high-aspect ratio and sidewall structures remains a hardly accomplishable task. Novel exchangeable and customizable scanning probe tips - NanoBits - can be attached to standard AFM cantilevers offering unprecedented freedom in adapting the shape and size of the tips. These NanoBits of few \u03bcm size have to be assembled into micro-cartridges. This challenging assembly task is performed inside the SEM by a micro-gripper. A powerful automation framework has been developed facilitating image based automation and visual servoing for this task. Template matching, BLOB-detection, and special SEM-based detection approaches are used to achieve the automated assembly.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present an approach that aids the human operator of unmanned aerial vehicles by automatically performing collision avoidance with obstacles in the environment so that the operator can focus on the global direction of motion of the vehicle. As opposed to systems that override operator control as a last resort in order to avoid collisions (such as those found in modern automobiles), our approach is designed such that the operator can rely on the automatic collision avoidance, enabling intuitive and safe operator control of vehicles that may otherwise be difficult to control. Our approach continually extrapolates the future flight path of the vehicle given the current operator control input. If an imminent collision is predicted our algorithm will override the operator's control input with the nearest control input that will actually let the vehicle avoid collisions with obstacles. This ensures safe flight while simultaneously maintaining the intent of the human operator as closely as possible. We successfully implemented our approach on a physical quadrotor system in a laboratory environment. In all experiments the human operator failed to crash the vehicle into floors, walls, ceilings, or obstacles, even when deliberately attempting to do so.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Calibration continues to receive significant attention in robotics because of its key impact on performance and cost associated with the operation of complex robots. Calibration of kinematic parameters is typically the first mandatory step. To this end, a variety of metrology systems and corresponding algorithms have been described in the literature relying on measurements of the pose of the end-effector using a camera or laser tracking system, or, exploiting constraints arising from contacts of the end-effector with the environment. In this work, we take inspiration from the behavior of infants and certain animals, who are believed to use self-stimulation or self-touch to \u201ccalibrate\u201d their body representations, and present a new solution to this problem by letting the robot close the kinematic chain by touching its own body. The robot considered in this paper is sensorized with tactile arrays for a total of about 4200 sensing points. The correspondence between the predicted contact point from existing forward kinematics and the actual position on the robot's `skin' provides sample data that allows refining the kinematic representation (DH parameters). The data collection procedure is automated - self-touch is autonomously executed by the robot - and can be repeated at any time, providing a compact self-calibration system that does not require an external measurement apparatus.",

        "abstract": "Lane-level digital maps can simplify driving tasks for robotic cars as well as enhance performance and reliability for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) by providing strong priors about the driving environment. In this paper, we present a system for automatic generation of precise lane-level maps by using conventional low-cost sensors installed in most of current commercial cars. It mainly consists of two modules, i.e. road orthographic image generation and lane graph construction. First, we divide the global map into fixed local segments based on the road network topology. According to the local map segments, we accumulate the bird's eye view images of the road surface by fusing GPS, INS and visual odometry, and subsequently integrate them into synthetic orthographic images with the reference of the local map segments. Furthermore, the information of the driving lanes is extracted from the orthographic images and a large amount of vehicle trajectories, which is used to construct the lane graph of the map based on the lane models we proposed. Such a system can offer increased value as well as promote the automation level for today's commercial cars without being supplemented additional sensors. Experiments show promising results of the automatic map generation of the real-world roads, which substantiated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Several approaches have been presented which allow robots to build structures to adapt themselves or their environments. To autonomously build these structures, a design must be made, from which instructions for the fabrication process can be derived. For a constrained fabrication process, e.g. considering the limited range of a robot, this transfer can be cumbersome. We present a local building process based on a sequence of two distinct operations, which implicitly encodes the shape of a structure. Given this encoding, the structure can readily be built with a real-world robotic system. We show automatic design of structures reaching out of the robot's range and fulfilling stability and strength constraints using an evolutionary design algorithm. The final design can then be built with a robotic arm from wooden cubes and hot melt adhesives. We demonstrate the whole process including the construction of a structure from more than thirty cubes with our real-world setup. We expect that automatic design and construction can further improve the physical adaptability of robotic systems.",

In this paper, we present a novel method to solve the problem of unknown object boundaries for handheld objects in an unstructured environment using robotic vision. The objective is to solve the problem of object segmentation without prior knowledge of the objects that human interacts with daily. In particular, we present a method that segments handheld objects by observing human-object interaction process, and performs incremental learning on the acquired models using SVM. The unknown object boundary is estimated using sequential back-tracking via exploitation of affine relationship of consecutive frames. The segmentation is achieved using identified optimal object boundaries, and the extracted models are used to perform future object search and recognition tasks.",

The problem consists of grasping an article from a random point, recognizing it and then bringing it into an unfolded state. We propose a data-driven method for clothes recognition from depth images using Random Decision Forests. We also propose a method for unfolding an article of clothing after estimating and grasping two key-points, using Hough forests. Both methods are implemented into a POMDP framework allowing the robot to interact optimally with the garments, taking into account uncertainty in the recognition and point estimation process. This active recognition and unfolding makes our system very robust to noisy observations. Our methods were tested on regular-sized clothes using a dualarm manipulator and an Xtion depth sensor. We achieved 100% accuracy in active recognition and 93.3% unfolding success rate, while our system operates faster compared to the state of the art.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel control framework to enable nonholonomic wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) to autonomously drive in an environment with the speed fast enough so that the dynamics effect (e.g., Coriolis effect) is not negligible, yet, still less than a certain threshold to prevent slippage at the wheels. For this, instead of the Newtonian vehicle modeling, we adopt Lagrange-D'Alembert formulation, which then allows us to explicitly relate the system's state/control with the constraint force, so that we can predict/detect possibility of a given motion's violating the no-slip condition. We present a scheme to generate a no-slip/collision-free timed-trajectory for the WMRs using this Lagrange-D'Alembert formulation. We also propose a backstepping-based control law, which enables the WMR to track the generated trajectory while respecting its nonholonomic constraints. Experiment, using a modified commercial radio-controlled car, is performed to verify the theory.",

        "abstract": "Legged robots have unique capabilities to traverse complex environments by stepping over and onto objects. Many footstep planners have been developed to take advantage of these capabilities. However, legged robots also have inherent constraints such as a maximum step height and distance. These constraints typically limit their reachable space, independent of footstep planning. Thus, we propose that robots such as humanoid robots that have manipulation capabilities should use them. A robot should autonomously modify its environment if necessary. We present a system that enabled a real robot to use a box to create itself a stair step or place a board on the ground to cross a gap, allowing it to reach its otherwise unreachable goal configuration.",

In this article, we present the first FWMAV with onboard vision processing for autonomous flight in generic environments. In particular, we introduce the DelFly `Explorer', a 20-gram FWMAV equipped with a 0.98-gram autopilot and a 4.0-gram onboard stereo vision system. We explain the design choices that permit carrying the extended payload, while retaining the DelFly's hover capabilities. In addition, we introduce a novel stereo vision algorithm, LongSeq, designed specifically to cope with the flapping motion and the desire to attain a computational effort tuned to the frame rate. The onboard stereo vision system is illustrated in the context of an obstacle avoidance task in an environment with sparse obstacles.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous robot execution of surgical sub-tasks has the potential to reduce surgeon fatigue and facilitate supervised tele-surgery. This paper considers the sub-task of surgical debridement: removing dead or damaged tissue fragments to allow the remaining healthy tissue to heal. We present an autonomous multilateral surgical debridement system using the Raven, an open-architecture surgical robot with two cable-driven 7 DOF arms. Our system combines stereo vision for 3D perception with trajopt, an optimization-based motion planner, and model predictive control (MPC). Laboratory experiments involving sensing, grasping, and removal of 120 fragments suggest that an autonomous surgical robot can achieve robustness comparable to human performance. Our robot system demonstrated the advantage of multilateral systems, as the autonomous execution was 1.5\u00d7 faster with two arms than with one; however, it was two to three times slower than a human. Execution speed could be improved with better state estimation that would allow more travel between MPC steps and fewer MPC replanning cycles. The three primary contributions of this paper are: (1) introducing debridement as a sub-task of interest for surgical robotics, (2) demonstrating the first reliable autonomous robot performance of a surgical sub-task using the Raven, and (3) reporting experiments that highlight the importance of accurate state estimation for future research.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In the past, robotic assembly has required rigid fixturing and special purpose robotic tools for every assembly component. Unfortunately, rigid fixtures and special purpose robotic tools often have to be customized for varying geometries. Alternatively, it is possible to operate in a semi-structured environment, defined by the use of softer fixtures (e.g. pickup bin) and softer robotic tools (e.g. suction cups or compliant pads) that can be used for many assembly applications without modification, but they demand specific motion plans that can tolerate greater positional uncertainty. We have developed a system that supports autonomous generation of parameterized fine motion plans for assembly that are robust under positional uncertainty and compliance introduced by the use of a suction cup instead of a gripper. To accomplish this a classifier is trained, implemented and tested for performance in the semi-structured environment for distinguishing between a failed or successful assembly. The trained classifier is then integrated with the entire system and many robot-attended experiments are performed that vary the fine motion parameters, and optimize them for successful outcomes using an Interval Estimation optimization algorithm. An approach to machine learning based on Support Vector Machines and Principal Component Analysis is used to make the optimization autonomous. We achieved a 99.7% classification accuracy with the trained classifier and by running repeated robot-attended experiments with artificial positional uncertainty and optimizing fine motion parameters, we were able to achieve a 38% improvement compared to fine motion plans with initial best guess parameters.",

        "abstract": "In orthopedic surgery, bone-cutting procedures are frequently performed. However, bone-cutting procedures are very risky in cases where vital organs or nerves exist beneath the target bones. In such cases, surgeons are required to determine the depth of the penetration into the bone by using only their haptic senses. Thus, we developed a handheld bone-cutting-tool system that detects the penetration of the cutting material. The developed system autonomously detects the penetration before total penetration and stops the actuation of the cutting tool, leaving a very thin remnant of work material. The developed system estimates the cutting resistance by using its motor's current and rotational speed. On the basis of data collected preoperatively, the system estimates the cutting state by using a support vector machine (SVM). According to the SVM outputs, the system detects the penetration of the work material and autonomously stops the actuation of the cutting tool. The proposed method was verified through experiments, and the results showed that the developed system successfully detected the penetrations of work materials and stopped autonomously immediately before total penetration. This study showed that the autonomous detection of bone penetration with a hand-held bone-cutting tool is feasible by using the proposed scheme.",

The visual odometry algorithm uses an uncertainty analysis of the depth information to align newly observed features against a global sparse model of previously detected 3D features. The visual odometry provides updates at roughly 30 Hz that is fused at 1 KHz with the inertial sensor data through a Kalman Filter. The high-rate pose estimation is used as feedback for the controller, enabling autonomous flight. We developed a 4DOF path planner and implemented a real-time 3D SLAM where all the system runs on-board. The experimental results and live video demonstrates the autonomous flight and 3D SLAM capabilities of the quadrotor with our system.",

        "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) impact 1 in 88 children in the United States. The cost of ASD intervention is tremendous with huge individual and social consequences. In recent years, robotic systems have been introduced with considerable success for ASD intervention because of their potential to engage children with ASD. In this work, we present a novel closed-loop autonomous robotic system for imitation skill learning for ASD intervention. Children with ASD show powerful impairment in imitation, which has been associated with a host of neurodevelopmental and learning challenges over time. The presented robotic system offers dynamic, adaptive and autonomous interaction for learning of imitation skills with real-time performance evaluation and feedback. The system has been tested in a user study with young children with ASD and typically developing (TD) control sample. Further, the performance of the system was compared with that of a human therapist in the user study. The results demonstrate that the developed robotic system is well-tolerated by the target population, engaged the children with ASD more than a human therapist, and produced performances that were relatively better than that of a human therapist.",

        "abstract": "Brain Machine Interface systems provide ways of communication and control of a variety of devices that range from domestic appliances to humanoid robots. Most BMI systems are designed exclusively to control devices using low-level commands, or high-level commands when devices with pre-programmed functionalities are available. In this paper, we build on our previous work on BMI-based Learning System in which we presented a different approach for designing BMI systems that incorporate learning capabilities that relieve the user from tedious low-level control. In this work, we extend the capabilities of our framework to allow a user to be able to teach and evaluate a robotic system by using a BMI. We provide general system architecture and demonstrate its applicability in new domains such as teaching a humanoid robot object manipulation skills and evaluating its performance. Our approach consists of 1) tele-operating robot's actions while robot's camera collects object's visual properties, 2) learning manipulation skills (i.e. push-left, lift-up, etc.) by approximating a posterior probability of commonly performed actions when observing similar properties, and 3) evaluating robot's performance by considering brain-based error perception of the human while he/she passively observes the robot performing the learned skill. This technique consists of monitoring EEG signals to detect a brain potential called error related negativity (ERN) that spontaneously occurs when the user perceives an error made by the robot. By using human error perception, we demonstrate that it is possible to evaluate robot actions and provide feedback to improve its learning performance. We present results from five human subjects who successfully used our framework to teach a humanoid robot how to manipulate diverse objects, and evaluate robot skills by visual observation.",

While several controllers exist, this controller aims to provide improved path following while cornering on sloped terrain. Towards this goal, this work develops a new kinematic controller that considers the effect of slip and a new dynamic controller that better compensates modelling error and actuator disturbances. The kinematic controller uses a new kinematic model and applies backstepping architecture with variable structure control manifolds to assure smooth and graceful yaw rate commands. The dynamic controller is also based upon backstepping, but introduces integrator states to the architecture and derives a new controller to improve yaw rate tracking. Simulations and field experiments demonstrate resulting performance improvements, which are compared to prior work to highlight contributions of this work.",

        "abstract": "Environmental monitoring with mobile robots requires solving the informative path planning problem. A key challenge is how to compute a continuous path over space and time that will allow a robot to best sample the environment for an initially unknown phenomenon. To address this problem we devise a layered Bayesian Optimisation approach that uses two Gaussian Processes, one to model the phenomenon and the other to model the quality of selected paths. By using different acquisition functions over both models we tackle the exploration-exploitation trade off in a principled manner. Our method optimises sampling over continuous paths and allows us to find trajectories that maximise the reward over the path. We test our method on a large scale experiment for modelling ozone concentration in the US, and on a mobile robot modelling the changes in luminosity. Comparisons are presented against information based criteria and point-based strategies demonstrating the benefits of our method.",

        "abstract": "Deploying robots for service tasks requires learning algorithms that scale to the combinatorial complexity of our daily environment. Inspired by the way humans decompose complex tasks, hierarchical methods for robot learning have attracted significant interest. In this paper, we apply the MAXQ method for hierarchical reinforcement learning to continuous state spaces. By using Gaussian Process Regression for MAXQ value function decomposition, we obtain probabilistic estimates of primitive and completion values for every subtask within the MAXQ hierarchy. From these, we recursively compute probabilistic estimates of state-action values. Based on the expected deviation of these estimates, we devise a Bayesian exploration strategy that balances optimization of expected values and risk from exploring unknown actions. To further reduce risk and to accelerate learning, we complement MAXQ with learning from demonstrations in an interactive way. In every situation and subtask, the system may ask for a demonstration if there is not enough knowledge available to determine a safe action for exploration. We demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to efficiently learn solutions to complex tasks on a box stacking scenario.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous robots need to make sense of their surroundings, recognize objects, detect and, possibly, identify the people around them. Visual perception would be ideally suited for these tasks. Yet, visual perception remains one of the limiting factors of modern robotics: artificial vision systems tend to perform poorly in normal environments, where the scene and the illumination conditions are unpredictable. Evolution has faced similar problems, leading to surprisingly accurate visual capabilities, even in species with very small brains. We argue that the success of biological perception systems relies on three fundamental computational principles: (a) the continual coupling of perception and behavior; (b) the resulting emergence of multimodal cues; (c) and their efficient integration. Building on these computational principles, we describe a humanoid robot that emulates the dynamic strategy by which humans examine a visual scene. The proprioceptive and visual depth cues resulting from this strategy are integrated in statistically optimal manner into a unified representation. We show that this approach yields accurate and robust 3D representations of the observed scene.",

In this paper we consider the multi-robot motion planning problem in large robot teams and present a decoupled approach by combining decentralized path planning methods and swarm technologies. Instead of a central coordination, a proper behavior which is directly selected according to the context is used by the robot to keep cooperating with others and to resolve path collisions. We show experimentally that the quality of solutions and the scalability of our method are significantly better than those of conventional decoupled path planning methods. Furthermore, compared to conventional swarm approaches, our method can be widely applied in large-scale environments.",

        "abstract": "A novel approach is proposed to achieve simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals. It is assumed that the environment is unknown and that the receiver location measurements (provided by a GNSS receiver) are noisy. The 3D environment map is decomposed into a grid of binary-state cells (occupancy grid) and the receiver locations are approximated by sets of particles. Using a large number of sparsely sampled GNSS SNR measurements and receiver/satellite coordinates (all available from off-the-shelf GNSS receivers), likelihoods of blockage are associated with every receiver-to-satellite beam. The posterior distribution of the map and poses is shown to represent a factor graph, on which Loopy Belief Propagation is used to efficiently estimate the probabilities of each cell being occupied or empty, along with the probability of the particles for each receiver location. Experimental results demonstrate our algorithm's ability to coarsely map (in three dimensions) a corner of a university campus, while also correcting for uncertainties in the location of the GNSS receiver.",

However, most of these datasets tend to consist of assorted collections of images from the web that do not include 3D information or pose information. Furthermore, they target the problem of object category recognition - whereas solving the problem of object instance recognition might be sufficient for many robotic tasks. To address these issues, we present a high-quality, large-scale dataset of 3D object instances, with accurate calibration information for every image. We anticipate that \u201csolving\u201d this dataset will effectively remove many perception-related problems for mobile, sensing-based robots. The contributions of this work consist of: (1) BigBIRD, a dataset of 100 objects (and growing), composed of, for each object, 600 3D point clouds and 600 high-resolution (12 MP) images spanning all views, (2) a method for jointly calibrating a multi-camera system, (3) details of our data collection system, which collects all required data for a single object in under 6 minutes with minimal human effort, and (4) multiple software components (made available in open source), used to automate multi-sensor calibration and the data collection process.

        "abstract": "In this paper, experimental studies of bilateral teleoperation control of a quadrotor system are presented. Not only position control but force control of a quadrotor system is regulated by forming a force controlled loop. The contact force is measured by a load cell mounted on the top of the quadrotor system. The sensed force is used for a haptic device as an operator feels the force. This configuration forms the bilateral teleoperation control system. Contact force of a quadrotor system in the altitude direction is regulated by the command from the master. The quadrotor system is controlled by a master to fly up from the ground to the ceiling, and to maintain desired contact force against the ceiling, and finally to land back on the ground. This experimental work mimics the possible ceiling task performed by a quadrotor system to see the feasibility of applying the force control technique to the quadrotor system. Experimental studies confirm the feasible force control performance.",

        "abstract": "Humans have an incredible capacity to learn properties of objects by pure tactile exploration with their two hands. With robots moving into human-centred environment, tactile exploration becomes more and more important as vision may be occluded easily by obstacles or fail because of different illumination conditions. In this paper, we present our first results on bimanual compliant tactile exploration, with the goal to identify objects and grasp them. An exploration strategy is proposed to guide the motion of the two arms and fingers along the object. From this tactile exploration, a point cloud is obtained for each object. As the point cloud is intrinsically noisy and un-uniformly distributed, a filter based on Gaussian Processes is proposed to smooth the data. This data is used at runtime for object identification. Experiments on an iCub humanoid robot have been conducted to validate our approach.",

These patches are intended to provide a reasonable set of choices for higher-level footfall selection algorithms, and are pre-filtered for several attributes - including location, curvature, and normal - that we observed humans to prefer. Input is from a 640 \u00d7 480 depth camera augmented with a 9-DoF inertial measurement unit to sense the direction of gravity. The system is capable of finding approximately 700 patches/second on commodity hardware, though the intention is not to find as many patches as possible but to reasonably sample upcoming terrain with quality patches. Sixty recordings of human subjects traversing rocky trails were analyzed to give a baseline for target patch properties. While the presented system is not designed to select a single foothold, it does find a set of patches for possible footholds which are statistically similar to the patches humans select.",

        "abstract": "Robotic manipulators for Robot-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RMIS) pass through small incisions into the patient's body and interact with soft internal organs. The performance of traditional robotic manipulators such as the da Vinci Robotic System is limited due to insufficient flexibility of the manipulator and lack of haptic feedback. Modern surgical manipulators have taken inspiration from biology e.g. snakes or the octopus. In order for such soft and flexible arms to reconfigure itself and to control its pose with respect to organs as well as to provide haptic feedback to the surgeon, tactile sensors can be integrated with the robot's flexible structure. The work presented here takes inspiration from another area of biology: cucumber tendrils have shown to be ideal tactile sensors for the plant that they are associated with providing useful environmental information during the plant's growth. Incorporating the sensing principles of cucumber tendrils, we have created miniature sensing elements that can be distributed across the surface of soft manipulators to form a sensor network capable of acquire tactile information. Each sensing element is a retractable hemispherical tactile measuring applied pressure. The actual sensing principle chosen for each tactile makes use of optic fibres that transfer light signals modulated by the applied pressure from the sensing element to the proximal end of the robot arm. In this paper, we describe the design and structure of the sensor system, the results of an analysis using Finite Element Modeling in ABAQUS as well as sensor calibration and experimental results. Due to the simple structure of the proposed tactile sensor element, it is miniaturisable and suitable for MIS. An important contribution of this work is that the developed sensor system can be \u201dloosely\u201d integrated with a soft arm effectively operating independently of the arm and without affecting the arm's motion during bending or elongation.

Looking through a Japanese comedy style called \"manzai\" or the art of conversation, we picked out several methods for making human laugh. Then we made several skits with the advice of comedians, and made the whole body humanoid robot perform them. Results of experimental evaluation with these skits shows that the robot's behavior made subjects laugh and change their psychological state seen as a decrease of \"Depression\" and \"Anger\".",

        "abstract": "Unmanned rescue, observation and/or research vehicles with high terrain adaptability, fast velocity and high reliability to reach difficult rough terrain locations are still demanded, but most vehicles increase rough terrain adapt ability at the expense of low velocity and/or complex mechanisms. We propose a novel vehicle consisting of a very simple blade-type crawler and active antennas with rollers, resembling a wharf roach. This configuration assures stable travelling over uneven terrain at high-speeds, with a very simple and reliable mechanism. This article presents the basic concept, mechanical design of the crawler and the antennas, and the basic motion control strategies. Moreover, we built and tested the first small mechanical prototype named KEIOS-I, and got successful results from experiments on uneven terrain at a high-speed traveling, and also lateral travelling and jumping motions. Future work will also implement roller skating mode using the active antennas equipped with rollers.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel blind collision detection and material characterisation scheme for a compliant robotic arm. By the incorporation of a simple MEMS ac-celerometer at each joint, the robot is able to detect collision, identify the material of an obstacle, and create a map of the environment. Detailed hardware design is provided, illustrating its value for building a compact and economical robot platform. The proposed method does not require the additional use of vision sensor for mapping the environment, and hence is termed as \u2018blind\u2019 collision detection and environment mapping. Based on the shock wave and vibration signals, the proposed algorithm is able to classify a range of materials encountered. Detailed laboratory evaluation was performed with controlled obstacle collision from different orientation and locations with varying force and materials. The proposed method has achieved 98% detection sensitivity while maintaining 77% specificity. Furthermore, by using sound feature extraction and machine learning techniques, the classifier produces an accuracy of 98% for classifying four different impact materials. In this paper, we also demonstrate its use for detailed environment mapping by using the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "A new approach to physically assisting the human with a wearable robot is presented. Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRLs) attached to the human waist support the body efficiently when the human is taking fatiguing postures, e.g. hunching over, squatting, or reaching the ceiling. Unlike a leg exoskeleton, where powered joints are attached to the human joints and are constrained to move together with the human limb, the SRL can take an arbitrary posture to maximize the load bearing efficiency. Taking a near-singular configuration, the SRL can bear a large load with small power consumption. First, the \u201cbracing\u201d strategy for supporting the human body is described, followed by a mathematical analysis of the load bearing efficiency. The optimal SRL posture and joint torques are then obtained in order to minimize the human load. Numerical and experimental results using a prototype of the SRL demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.",

Instead of discarding information from non-keyframes for reducing the computational complexity, the proposed C-KLAM presents a novel, elegant, and computationally-efficient technique for incorporating most of this information in a consistent manner, resulting in improved estimation accuracy. To achieve this, C-KLAM projects both proprioceptive and exteroceptive information from the non-keyframes to the keyframes, using marginalization, while maintaining the sparse structure of the associated information matrix, resulting in fast and efficient solutions. The performance of C-KLAM has been tested in experiments, using visual and inertial measurements, to demonstrate that it achieves performance comparable to that of the computationally-intensive batch MAP-based 3D SLAM, that uses all available measurement information.",

        "abstract": "The paper presents a walking pattern generator and a balance control system for a bipedal robot to handle an unknown slope. The robot uses onboard gyro and accelerometer sensors to detect the pose information of the upper-body. A controller is proposed for the robot to walk on an unknown slope by adjusting the tilt angle of the upper-body. The theory of central pattern generator (CPG) is applied to generate the walking trajectory. By using the pose information of the upper-body, we developed a method to determine the relationship between the slope surface and the upper-body pose and generate the compensation motion to adjust the tilt angle of the upper-body. The compensation control consists of predictive compensation and immediate compensation. The predictive compensation responds to adjust the upper-body pose before beginning of the next step. The immediate compensation is applied to adjust the upper-body pose during the single support phase. The integrated controller adapts to the unknown slope in real time while robot walking. Using the bipedal robot NAO, the experimental results show that the biped robot can walk successfully on unknown slopes.",

One of the interesting features of a biological snake is its ability to avoid obstacles or a barrier by turning its whole body from its trajectory. This special obstacle avoidance motion is different from other types of animal, and thus, it is worth to be analyzed and realized into a snake-like robot. The paper first briefly explains: 1) the phase oscillator model which represents the CPG model and 2) the CPG network. Next, we address several issues related to the existing/typical turning control of a snake-like robot. We then propose the phase transition method utilizing the phase difference control parameter to realize the turning motion of a snake-like robot. We also introduce a new parameter to control the turning of the robot, where it provides a way to incorporate sensory feedback into the CPG model. Simulation results show that the proposed turning method can be used efficiently as an obstacle avoidance method for a snake-like robot.",

CARRT* can account for the CPU's cache size in a manner that keeps its working dataset in the cache. The motion planner progressively subdivides the robot's configuration space into smaller regions as the number of configuration samples rises. By focusing configuration exploration in a region for periods of time, nearest neighbor searching is accelerated since the working dataset is small enough to fit in the cache. CARRT* also rewires the motion planning graph in a manner that complements the cache-aware subdivision strategy to more quickly refine the motion planning graph toward optimality. We demonstrate the performance benefit of our cache-aware motion planning approach for scenarios involving a point robot as well as the Rethink Robotics Baxter robot.",

        "abstract": "Non-central catadioptric models are able to cope with irregular camera setups and inaccuracies in the manufacturing process but are computationally demanding and thus not suitable for robotic applications. On the other hand, calibrating a quasi-central (almost central) system with a central model introduces errors due to a wrong relationship between the viewing ray orientations and the pixels on the image sensor. In this paper, we propose a central approximation to quasi-central catadioptric camera systems that is both accurate and efficient. We observe that the distance to points in 3D is typically large compared to deviations from the single viewpoint. Thus, we first calibrate the system using a state-of-the-art non-central camera model. Next, we show that by remapping the observations we are able to match the orientation of the viewing rays of a much simpler single viewpoint model with the true ray orientations. While our approximation is general and applicable to all quasi-central camera systems, we focus on one of the most common cases in practice: hypercatadioptric cameras. We compare our model to a variety of baselines in synthetic and real localization and motion estimation experiments. We show that by using the proposed model we are able to achieve near non-central accuracy while obtaining speed-ups of more than three orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art non-central models.",

        "abstract": "Many robotic and mobile mapping systems have been developed using multiple 2D LIDARs (briefly multi-LIDAR system) to sense environment. In such systems, extrinsic calibration of all LIDARs is essential for making collaborative use of the data from different sensors. This research aims at developing a calibration method for multi-LIDAR systems at the general scene, such as an outdoor place or an underground parking-lot, without modification to environment by putting calibration targets. In this paper, the calibration method is proposed by aligning the 3D data of different LIDARs. They are concerned at two-levels: 1) reference calibration, i.e. finding the transformation from a reference LIDAR to the platform frame; 2) multi-LIDAR calibration, i.e. finding the LIDARs' relative geometries by referring to the reference one. The method is examined in calibrating the multiple 2D LIDARs on an intelligent vehicle platform POSS-V, where the data collected through a driving in an underground parking-lot are registered to find sensors' geometry. Calibration accuracy is examined by comparing with a CAD model of the scene, which was measured by using a total station.",

The complete algorithm is tested experimentally on the R2 hand, with results demonstrating tracking performance and robustness against disturbances.",

However there are many sources of inaccuracy acting on the microrobotic systems. Characterization and compensation enable reduction of the systematic errors of the micropositioning stages and improve the positioning accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on vision and pseudo-periodic encoded patterns to characterize the position-dependent errors along XY stages. This method is particularly suitable for microscale motion characterization thanks to its high range-to-resolution ratio and avoidance of camera calibration. Based on look-up tables and interpolation techniques, we perform compensation and get improved accuracy. The experimental results show an accuracy improved by 84% for square tracking and by 68% for random points reaching (respectively from 22 \u03bcm to 3.5 \u03bcm and from 22 \u03bcm to 7 \u03bcm).",

To use most of them in practical real applications, some operational parameters need to be determined: maximum and minimum values, normalization ratios, quality thresholds, robustness in front of position errors and, more importantly, relations between alternative metrics. This paper proposes a methodology to study and characterize the operational parameters that allow the use of several metrics in practical applications, and comparing them. The proposed approach uses exhaustive simulation testing to obtains statically significant results regarding the measurements of several quality metrics. This allows an informed setting of the practical operational values for each metric. Results are provided for a Barrett hand grasping a varied set of objects.",

        "abstract": "Helical microswimmers capable of propulsion at low Reynolds numbers have been proposed for many applications. However, closed-loop controlled helical swimmers are still challenging because of the limits of optical tracking, and a lack of control parameters lying on the swimming characteristics of both linear propulsion and steering. Although the linear propulsion characteristics of helical swimmers were extensively studied, the steering characteristics have not yet been clearly shown. Helical microswimmers are efficient in propulsion, whereas their high surface-to-volume ratio limits the steering performances. In this paper, we characterized both the direction and inclination steering using a real-time visual tracking of orientation. The direction steering efficiency could be increased in terms of response time with a higher inclination angle both in floating conditions and on a sticky substrate. We thus developed a 3D steering strategy by combining direction and inclination steering to improve the steering performance. We further expect that the characterization of steering performance can contribute to defining the control parameters for future closed-loop control.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the concept of cable configuration of cable-driven parallel robots (CDPR). At a given pose a cable configuration describes the state of cables, i.e. under tension or slack, and plays a major role for the cable tensions and the platform positioning errors. Being given a CDPR with non-elastic cables and a model for the coiling system we describe how the cable configuration can be determined in a guaranteed way for a desired trajectory of the platform. We show that if the CDPR has more than 6 cables it is extremely unlikely that more than 6 cables will be under tension simultaneously even under perfect conditions. It appears that on a trajectory the cable configuration exhibits multiple changes, leading to large variations in the cable tensions.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel biased sampling technique, Cloud RRT\u2217, for efficiently computing high-quality collision-free paths, while maintaining the asymptotic convergence to the optimal solution. Our method uses sampling cloud for allocating samples on promising regions. Our sampling cloud consists of a set of spheres containing a portion of the C-space. In particular, each sphere projects to a collision-free spherical region in the workspace. We initialize our sampling cloud by conducting a workspace analysis based on the generalized Voronoi graph. We then update our sampling cloud to refine the current best solution, while maintaining the global sampling distribution for exploring understudied other homotopy classes. We have applied our method to a 2D motion planning problem with kinematic constraints, i.e., the Dubins vehicle model, and compared it against the state-of-the-art methods. We achieve better performance, up to three times, over prior methods in a robust manner.",

        "abstract": "Although many approaches have been developed to form robot coalitions that can achieve a multirobot task, no general methods exist to execute these coalitions, especially when the coordination among the robots is tightly coupled. In this paper, we propose a coordination mechanism as the first step to address coalition execution; it provides a flexible method to reason about synergies with overlapping coalitions (thus enabling multi-tasking robots in multi-robot tasks), which not only improves efficiency, but also reduces resource requirements in task execution. This means that our approach enables tasks that cannot be easily handled before, especially when critical resources are rare but commonly required. Our approach is based on the concept of sensor constraint, which is introduced by the tight coupling (e.g., information sharing) between the robots. We show that our algorithm is sound and complete in finding a coordination solution given a few assumptions, and discuss a distributed implementation. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the capabilities of this new approach.",

Supporting low-cost operations, this work focuses on collaborative positioning for a team of AUV's, given a bathymetric terrain map, and only an altimeter and acoustic modem on each vehicle. The joint localization is performed via decentralized particle filtering, where we extend the usual measurement model to allow received information to modulate the importance function. We investigate the impact on performance of sensor noise, communication interval and number of vehicles. Results are shown for bathymetry maps near St. John's Island, Singapore, and for the Charles River Basin, Boston. In the second case, we ran our algorithm with physical measurements from actual vehicles executing trajectories.",

It consists of a hybrid controller that uses both visual servoing and impedance controllers. This can be applied to tasks that cannot be done with vision or haptic information alone. In this framework, the state of the task can be obtained from visual information while haptic information is crucial for safe physical interaction with the human partner. The approach is validated on the task of jointly carrying a flat surface (e.g. a table) and then preventing an object (e.g. a ball) on top from falling off. The results show that this task can be successfully achieved. Furthermore, the framework presented allows for a more collaborative setup, by imparting task knowledge to the robot as opposed to a passive follower.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present an experimental study on real-time collision avoidance with potential fields that are based on 3D point cloud data and processed on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). The virtual forces from the potential fields serve two purposes. First, they are used for changing the reference trajectory. Second they are projected to and applied on torque control level for generating according nullspace behavior together with a Cartesian impedance main control loop. The GPU algorithm creates a map representation that is quickly accessible. In addition, outliers and the robot structure are efficiently removed from the data, and the resolution of the representation can be easily adjusted. Based on the 3D robot representation and the remaining 3D environment data, the virtual forces that are fed to the trajectory planning and torque controller are calculated. The algorithm is experimentally verified with a 7-Degree of Freedom (DoF) torque controlled KUKA/DLR Lightweight Robot for static and dynamic environmental conditions. To the authors knowledge, this is the first time that collision avoidance is demonstrated in real-time on a real robot using parallel GPU processing.",

To improve manual maintenance, we designed an aircraft fuel tank inspection robot which was composed of cable-driven sections. A suitable path is essential for the robot to reach the target zone while avoiding obstacles, but path planning for continuum robot is a challenge due to their complex kinematics models. To depict the collision free planning problem, a nonlinear, constrained optimization formulation was adopted. Projection strategy was presented and an imaginary straight line between the origin and the target was made up as a reference line to simplify the planning problem. We focused on the decrease of computing time complexity, and based on region clipping, a novel forward search method was proposed to solve this optimization-based planning problem. With the reference straight line, the minimum distance summation (MDS) was calculated to decide the optimal path relatively. Experiments on MATLAB were reasonably designed. Simulations and results analysis demonstrated excellent performance of region clipping search method and feasibility of the avoidance algorithm.",

In this paper, we construct a collision-free guidance control system for multiple small helicopters. The collision avoidance problem is regarded as a control problem with state restrictions, and the theory of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is applied to the guidance control system. A simple nonlinear guidance model is used for design of NMPC to reduce the computational cost. A novel position constraint is proposed for optimizing the avoidance trajectory of each helicopter. The effectiveness of the designed control system and proposed constraints are verified by numerical simulation and flight experiment.",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of generating force-closed point contact grasps on complex surfaces and model it as a combinatorial optimization problem. Using a multilevel refinement metaheuristic, we maximize the quality of a grasp subject to a reachability constraint by recursively forming a hierarchy of increasingly coarser optimization problems. A grasp is initialized at the top of the hierarchy and then locally refined until convergence at each level. Our approach efficiently addresses the high dimensional problem of synthesizing stable point contact grasps while resulting in stable grasps from arbitrary initial configurations. Compared to a sampling-based approach, our method yields grasps with higher grasp quality. Empirical results are presented for a set of different objects. We investigate the number of levels in the hierarchy, the computational complexity, and the performance relative to a random sampling baseline approach.",

Solutions to this problem have typically relied on special purpose, integrated implementations of task planning and motion planning algorithms. We propose a new approach that uses off-the-shelf task planners and motion planners and makes no assumptions about their implementation. Doing so enables our approach to directly build on, and benefit from, the vast literature and latest advances in task planning and motion planning. It uses a novel representational abstraction and requires only that failures in computing a motion plan for a high-level action be identifiable and expressible in the form of logical predicates at the task level. We evaluate the approach and illustrate its robustness through a number of experiments using a state-of-the-art robotics simulator and a PR2 robot. These experiments show the system accomplishing a diverse set of challenging tasks such as taking advantage of a tray when laying out a table for dinner and picking objects from cluttered environments where other objects need to be re-arranged before the target object can be reached.",

The Pseudo-Rigid Body Model (PRBM) approach is well-known for the synthesis of compliant mechanisms. It is usually based on the use of compliant joints to provide the mechanism mobilities. In this paper, we propose the HSC joint as a new type of revolute compliant joint that is well adapted to MM-RP, and that offers interesting properties in terms of stiffness and range of motion. Based on the HSC joint, a new compliant mechanism, suitable for interventional MRI, is introduced with assessment of a first prototype that is entirely made out of a single polymer part. The interest is twofold. First, the device constitutes a promising solution in this medical context. Second, the impact of the use of MM-RP in combination with PRBM can be evaluated, and their use is discussed as a conclusion.",

Since these robots are expected to co-habit the same environment with a human user, analysing and ensuring their safety is an important requirement. Safety analysis of domestic robots determine whether a robot achieves a desired safety level according to some quantitative safety metrics. When it comes to controller design for human friendly robots, it often involves introducing compliance and ensuring asymptotic stability using impedance control technique and passivity theories. The controller proposed in this work also uses a passive design that extends the standard impedance control scheme with energy and power based safety metrics to ensure that safety requirements defined in these norms are achieved by domestic robots. The effectiveness of the proposed guideline is illustrated with simulation and experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Learning complicated behaviors usually involves intensive manual tuning and expensive computational optimization because we have to solve a nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Recently, Todorov proposed a class of the so-called Linearly solvable Markov Decision Process (LMDP) which converts a nonlinear HJB equation to a linear differential equation. Linearity of the simplified HJB equation allows us to apply superposition to derive a new composite controller from a set of learned primitive controllers. However, his method was a model-based approach and it was not evaluated in a real domain. This study proposes a model-free method which is similar to the Least Squares Temporal Difference (LSTD) learning. In this method, the exponentially transformed cost function can be regarded as the discount factor in LSTD. Our proposed method is applied to learning walking behaviors with the quadruped robot to evaluate in real robot experiments. The goal of each primitive task is to go to the specific target position in the environment and that of the composite task is to approach arbitrary region represented by the primitives' target positions. Experimental results show that the composite policy can be used as a good initial policy for the new task.",

In the literature, image segmentation has been employed as auxiliary information in order to improve optical flow performance. In this work, an alternative approach is proposed, in which optical flow information is used to aid image segmentation, aiming at scene understading for mobile robots. The proposed system performs dense optical flow analysis, followed by clustering of the optical flow vectors in a four dimensional space (formed by the x and y positions, angle and magnitude of each vector). Results from the clustering are used as \u2018seeds\u2019 in the segmentation process, performed by watershed segmentation in our implementation. In addition, the flow \u2018image\u2019 is combined with the original image, generating an image better suited for watershed segmentation, reducing the local minima effect often seen in this type of segmentation algorithms. The main pipeline considers the use of multi-modality cameras (visible and thermal-infrared). Since they see substantially different information, multi-modality further improves the amount of features of the resulting flows. Experimental results in urban and semi-urban scenarios with efficient segmentation illustrate the applicability of the method.",

        "abstract": "Grasping objects is a well-known problem in robotics. If the objects to be grasped are known, usually they are to be placed at a desired position in a desired orientation. Therefore, the object pose w.r.t the gripper has to be known before placing the object. In this paper we propose a simple and efficient, yet robust approach to this challenge, which can (nearly) eliminate dead times of the employed manipulator - hence speeding up the process significantly. Our approach is based on the observation that the problem of finding a pose at which the object can be grasped and the problem of computing the pose of the object w.r.t. the gripper can be solved separately at different stages. Special attention is paid to the popular bin-picking problem where this strategy shows its full potential. To reduce the overall cycle time, we estimate the grasp pose after the object has been grasped. Our estimation technique relies on the inertial parameters of the object - instead of visual features - which enables us to easily incorporate pose changes due to grasping.

        "abstract": "Existing multi-robot cooperative perception solutions can be mainly classified into two categories, measurement-based and belief-based, according to the information shared among robots. With well-controlled communication, measurement-based approaches are expected to achieve theoretically optimal estimates while belief-based approaches are not because the cross-correlations between beliefs are hard to be perfectly estimated in practice. Nevertheless, belief-based approaches perform relatively stable under unstable communication as a belief contains the information of multiple previous measurements. Motivated by the observation that measurement sharing and belief sharing are respectively superior in different conditions, in this paper a hybrid algorithm, communication adaptive multi-robot simultaneous localization and tracking (ComAd MR-SLAT), is proposed to combine the advantages of both. To tackle the unknown or unstable communication conditions, the information to share is decided by maximizing the expected uncertainty reduction online, based on which the algorithm dynamically alternates between measurement-sharing and belief-sharing without information loss or reuse. The proposed ComAd MR-SLAT is evaluated in communication conditions with different packet loss rates and bursty loss lengths. In our experiments, ComAd MR-SLAT outperforms measurement-based and belief-based MR-SLAT in accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid algorithm and exhibit that ComAd MR-SLAT is robust under different communication conditions.",

        "abstract": "Series elastic actuators often use linear metal springs in their drivetrains, which requires design compromises between torque resolution and actuation bandwidth. Nonlinear springs (NLSs), with variable stiffness, overcome this limitation, enabling both high torque resolution and high bandwidth. Current NLS designs combine variable cam structures with off-the-shelf linear springs, which increases the overall size of these torque transmitting elements. NLS size could be reduced by using other materials as an elastic element. We present an optimization-based synthesis method for NLSs that are compact and encode a user-defined torque-deflection profile using elastic elements with an arbitrary stiffness profile. We experimentally validate the proposed method by creating a NLS prototype and testing it on an actuator testbed. The prototype uses rubber as the elastic element, resulting in a compact design that generates the desired torque profile, although hysteresis of the rubber material partially compromises performance. The results suggest that the proposed method successfully generates compact NLS designs, but that rubber elements need to be carefully chosen to mitigate hysteresis.",

        "abstract": "Developing models of flapping-winged fliers in free flight is vital for accurate control. The aerodynamics associated with flapping-winged flight are complex. Hence, a look-up table flight force model from wind tunnel data is a practical approach. In this work, we compare the flight of an ornithopter micro aerial vehicle (MAV), using free flight data collected from a Vicon motion capture system, to measured wind tunnel force and moment values. We compare the two data sets at equilibrium as a metric to determine the quality of the wind tunnel flight force estimation. To compare the two data sets, we find the predicted equilibrium angle of attack and velocity for the ornithopter in free flight. For a given flapping frequency and pitch control elevator deflection angle at free flight equilibrium, we compute the level sets at zero for pitch moment, net horizontal force, and net vertical force from the wind tunnel data. We then use the point on the zero moment level set that minimizes the vertical and horizontal force. The angle of attack and velocity at this minimal point are the wind tunnel predicted equilibrium point and are compared to the analogous free flight equilibrium point. We determined that the wind tunnel underestimates the angle of attack of the equilibrium point observed in free flight by 15 degrees, while the equilibrium velocity has an error of 0.1 m/s between the two sets at an average flight speed of 2 m/s.",

        "abstract": "The panorama of probabilistic completeness results for kinodynamic planners is still confusing. Most existing completeness proofs require strong assumptions that are difficult, if not impossible, to verify in practice. To make completeness results more useful, it is thus sensible to establish a classification of the various types of constraints and planning methods, and then attack each class with specific proofs and hypotheses that can be verified in practice. We propose such a classification, and provide a proof of probabilistic completeness for an important class of planners, namely those whose steering method is based on the interpolation of system trajectories in the state space. We also provide design guidelines for the interpolation function and discuss two criteria arising from our analysis: local boundedness and acceleration compliance.",

While CoM (Center of Mass) control is much more directly than ZMP feedback control in the view of rejecting unknown external disturbance. In the meanwhile, we hope the position-based humanoid robot can have the whole body compliance in standing maintenance. So we proposes a CoM compliance controller to achieve stable standing of position controlled humanoid robot under unknown disturbance. The controller uses the concept of force control and integrates virtual model control with admittance control, where an AMPM (Angular Momentum including inverted Pendulum Model)-based virtual model with variable gain is designed to not only generate desired recovery force but also take the GRF (Grand Reaction Force) constraints into account, while an admittance controller is employed to transform the desired force to expected CoM position and body attitude. The experiments were conducted on the humanoid robot \u2018Kong\u2019 by exerting external force disturbance and changing the slope of the ground to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.",

        "abstract": "Recently researchers have approached the problem of motion planning with topological constraints. In such problems, the inputs to the planner are source and destination points and the output is expected to be a valid path that respects the topological constraints. A concrete example of such problems - and the topic of this paper - is planning for a robot which is connected with a cable of limited length to a fixed point in the operation space. This paper presents a planning method for such problems by examining how the configuration space manifold can be represented efficiently. We introduce a convenient method for generating either parts or the complete atlas for the manifold based on special \u201ccable events\u201d. Generating parts of the configuration space on-the-fly enables improvements over the state of the art: (a)we decompose the environment into cells as needed rather than an off-line global discretization, obtaining competitive time and space complexity for our planner, (b) we are able to exploit topological structure to represent robot-cable configurations concisely, (c) we generalize the representation in order to examine cable-to-cable contacts, which have been widely ignored in the literature until now. Our results show the efficiency of the method and indicate further promise for procedures that represent manifolds via an amalgamation of implicit discrete topological structure and explicit Euclidean cells.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel, condition-invariant place recognition algorithm inspired by recent discoveries in human visual neuroscience. The algorithm combines intolerant but fast low resolution whole image matching with highly tolerant, sub-image patch matching processes. The approach does not require prior training and works on single images, alleviating the need for either a velocity signal or image sequence, differentiating it from current state of the art methods. We conduct an exhaustive set of experiments evaluating the relationship between place recognition performance and computational resources using part of the challenging Alderley sunny day \u2014 rainy night dataset, which has only been previously solved by integrating over 320 frame long image sequences. We achieve recall rates of up to 51% at 100% precision, matching places that have undergone drastic perceptual change while rejecting match hypotheses between highly aliased images of different places. Human trials demonstrate the performance is approaching human capability. The results provide a new benchmark for single image, condition-invariant place recognition.",

        "abstract": "In the Multi-Agent Path Finding problem (MAPF), we are given a map and a set of agents with distinct source and goal locations. The task is to compute a path for each agent from its initial location to its goal location without conflicting with other agents. MAPF solvers can be divided into classes based on their purpose. One of these classes is the class of online MAPF algorithms, in which the search for paths is interleaved with the actual physical moves of the agents. A prominent algorithm in this class is the Windowed Hierarchical Cooperative A\u2217 algorithm (WHCA\u2217) where paths are planned for each agent individually and cooperation is obtained using a reservation table. A number of extensions for WHCA\u2217 already exist. In this paper we propose a general approach for the baseline WHCA\u2217 algorithm which is orthogonal to all other existing extensions. We improve WHCA\u2217 by introducing the Conflict Oriented (CO) principle for focusing the agent coordination around conflicts. In addition, we provide a conflict-oriented prioritization mechanism that intelligently chooses which agent should act next. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of our approach over WHCA\u2217.",

Our approach uses a plug-and-play factor graph framework, which extends factor graph formulation to encode sensor measurements with different frequencies, latencies, and noise distributions. It provides a flexible foundation for plug-and-play sensing, and can incorporate new evolving sensors. A novel constrained optimal selection mechanism is presented to identify the optimal subset of active sensors to use, during initialization and when any sensor condition changes. This mechanism constructs candidate subsets of sensors based on heuristic rules and a ternary tree expansion algorithm. It quickly decides the optimal subset among candidates by maximizing observability coverage on state variables, while satisfying resource constraints and accuracy demands. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach selects subsets of sensors to provide satisfactory navigation solutions under various conditions, on large-scale real data sets using many sensors.",

        "abstract": "This work aims to extend the application field of the constraint-based control framework called iTaSC (instantaneous task specification using constraints) toward manipulation tasks. iTaSC offers two advantages with respect to other methods: the ability to specify tasks in different spaces (and not only in Cartesian coordinates as for the Task Frame Formalism), and the treatment of geometric uncertainties. These properties may be very useful within a manipulation context, where tasks are executed by robots with many degrees of freedom, which calls for some degree of abstraction; by choosing a suitable set of coordinates, it is possible to reduce the complexity and the number of constraints that fully describe such tasks; in addition, controlling only the subspace that is needed to fulfil a task allows us to use the remaining degrees of freedom of the robot system to achieve secondary objectives. This paper discusses the instruments and techniques that can be employed in manipulation scenarios; in particular it focuses on aspects like the specification of a grasp and control of the stance of the robotic arm. iTaSC offers the possibility of specifying a grasp. While this approach allows for very fine control of a grasping task, in most cases a less fine-grain specification suffices to guarantee a successful execution of the grasping action. To this end synergy-based grasp specification is formulated within iTaSC. We also show how to take into account secondary objectives for the arm stance. In particular we consider, as an example, the manipulability index along a given direction. Such indexes are maximised by exploring the null space of the other tasks. The proposed approach is demonstrated by means of simulations, where a robotic hand grasps a cylindrical object.",

        "abstract": "This work aims to extend the application field of the constraint-based control framework called iTaSC (instantaneous task specification using constraints) toward tasks where physical interaction between the robot and the environment, or a human, is contemplated. iTaSC, in its original formulation, allows for a systematic derivation of control schemes from task descriptions; tasks are defined as constraints enforced on outputs (e.g. distances, angles), and the iTaSC control takes care to fulfil such constraints by computing desired velocities to be commanded to the robot(s) joints. This approach, being based on a velocity resolution scheme, principally addresses tasks where positioning is the main issue. However, tasks that involve contacts with the environment or with the user, either desired or accidental, can be considered as well, taking advantage of impedance control, when position is controlled, or with force control. This paper describes the implementation of force tasks, and, by the combination of conflicting force and position tasks, impedance control, within the iTaSC formalism. This result is achieved by taking advantage of an approximate physical modelling of the robotic system and the environment. The proposed control scheme is tested by means of experiments where constraints on forces and/or positions described in cylindrical coordinates are imposed on a Kuka LWR arm.",

        "abstract": "To ensure safe and reliable operation in a robotic oil drilling system, it is essential to detect contact events such as impacts and slips between end-effectors and workpieces. In this challenging application, where high forces are used to manipulate heavy metal pipes in noisy environments, acoustic emissions (AE) sensors offer a promising contact sensing solution. Real-time AE signal features are used to create a multinomial contact event classifier. The sensitivity of signal features to a variety of contact events including two types of slip is presented. Results indicate that the classifier is able to robustly and dynamically classify contact events with >90% accuracy using a small set of AE signal features.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we present a reliable and continuous gesture recognition method that supports a natural and flexible interaction between the human and the robot. The aim is to provide a system that can be trained online with few samples and can cope with intra user variability during the gesture execution. The proposed approach relies on the generation of an ad-hoc Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for each gesture exploiting a direct estimation of the parameters. Each model represents the best prototype candidate from the associated gesture training set. The generated models are then employed within a continuous recognition process that provides the probability of each gesture at each step. The proposed method is evaluated in two case studies: a hand-performed letters recognizer and a natural gesture recognizer. Finally, we show the overall system at work in a simple human-robot interaction scenario.",

This pose changes considerably while the vehicle is driven, therefore it is good to know constantly the pose of the camera for several applications based on computer vision, such as advanced driver assistance systems, autonomous vehicles or robotics. These constant changes of the pose make interesting to be able to detect constantly the variations in its extrinsic parameters (height, pitch, roll). The validation of the autocalibration method is accomplished by a visual odometry implementation. A study of the improvement of the results of the visual odometry estimation taking into account the changes of the camera pose is presented, demonstrating the advantages of the autocalibration method.",

        "abstract": "We extend the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to obtain a method for continuous-time trajectory estimation (CICP) suitable for SLAM from actuated lidar. Traditional solutions to SLAM from actuated lidar rely heavily on the accuracy of an auxiliary pose sensor to form rigid frames. These frames are then used with ICP to obtain accurate pose estimates. However, since lidar records a single range sample at time, any error in inter-sample sensor motion must be accounted for. This is not possible if the frame is treated as a rigid point cloud. In this work, instead of ICP we estimate a continuous-time trajectory that takes into account inter-sample pose errors. The trajectory is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and formulated as a solution to a (sparse) linear system without restrictive assumptions on sensor motion. We evaluate the algorithm on synthetic and real data and show improved accuracy in open-loop SLAM in comparison to state-of-the-art rigid registration methods.",

Based on the accurate estimation of contact locations, and the direction and magnitude of the normal and tangential forces, the finger can robustly and rapidly follow surfaces with large change in curvature while maintaining a desired constant normal force. In this paper, the design and testing of the contact sensing finger are presented and the control algorithm for surface contour following is proposed and validated using objects with different shapes and surface materials. The results demonstrate that using the developed finger and the control algorithm, a surface can be efficiently explored with rapid sliding speed. To demonstrate the potential applications of the proposed approach, the friction properties of an explored object surface are computed and, for a known object, its pose is estimated.",

Local environmental chemical stimulation by dual pipettes is applied to the rotational speed control of bacterial flagellar motor, which is a rotary molecular machine. Here, we show quick response and rotational speed control of Na-driven flagellar motor in both accelerating and relaxing directions was demonstrated by automatic switching the local spout between Na-containing and Na-free solutions with dual pipettes. It was shown that the rotational speed could be maintained by automatic controlling the spouting velocity of Na-containing and Na-free solution with multiplying the applied DC voltage. Furthermore, it was confirmed that by applying the P-control, rotational speed of flagellar motor could be controlled more stably.",

        "abstract": "Spring-mass models have been very successful both in describing and generating running behaviors. Control of system energy within these models takes different forms, among which the use of a linear actuator in series with the leg spring has been preferred by many recent monopedal and bipedal platform designs due to its relative robustness and simplicity. However, the validity of the well-known Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) model of running for such platforms can only preserved under a specific family of control strategies to drive the actuator. In this paper, we propose a novel controller in this family, based on the idea of embedding a lossy SLIP template with a tunable damping coefficient into the linearly actuated compliant leg system. We show that this maximizes energy input within a single stride, allows decreased power requirements on the actuator compared to alternative methods, while preserving the validity and accuracy of analytic solutions and model-based controllers. We present systematic simulations to establish performance gains with respect to the commonly investigated method of modulating leg stiffness. Enabling the most efficient use of actuator power in this manner while preserving analytic tractability will allow efficient and accurate control of running for linearly actuated compliant leg designs.",

However, to simulate the real social environment, we use a rat-like robot composed of multiple links to chase a specific rat (target) in a group of rats (outside observers). In this paper, we aim to develop a real-time control system for a multi-link robot surrounded by multiple rats. A virtual impedance model was adopted to generate posture and trajectory for a multi-link robot named WR-5. With the analysis of virtual forces/moments acting on WR-5 based on the model, corresponding dynamic equations can be obtained to control the motion of WR-5. Simulation results show that the head of WR-5 can accurately direct a target object in the following test. After conducting experiments with three rat subjects (a target rat, two outside observers), the output results suggest that the head and body gesture of WR-5 achieves to follow the target in real-time. Meanwhile, the control system allows real-time avoidance of the moving outside observers during interaction.",

        "abstract": "The present paper discusses a planning and control strategy for robotic whole-arm manipulation of a slippery polygonal object by taking into account the estimated bounds of the frictional coefficient. In this study, randomized planning methods are first proposed in order to generate contact state transitions. Second, a novel control strategy that can switch manipulation between quasi-static, dynamic, and caging manipulation modes is proposed. Solving the forward dynamics problem, which is formulated as a complementarity problem, generates the desired trajectory and thus ensures that undesirable contact modes do not occur within the estimated bounds of the frictional coefficient. The validity of the proposed methods is then demonstrated through simulations and experiments.",

        "abstract": "Trajectory optimizers are a powerful class of methods for generating goal-directed robot motion. Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) is an indirect method which optimizes only over the unconstrained control-space and is therefore fast enough to allow real-time control of a full humanoid robot on modern computers. Although indirect methods automatically take into account state constraints, control limits pose a difficulty. This is particularly problematic when an expensive robot is strong enough to break itself. In this paper, we demonstrate that simple heuristics used to enforce limits (clamping and penalizing) are not efficient in general. We then propose a generalization of DDP which accommodates box inequality constraints on the controls, without significantly sacrificing convergence quality or computational effort. We apply our algorithm to three simulated problems, including the 36-DoF HRP-2 robot. A movie of our results can be found here goo.gl/eeiMnn.",

Often storage tanks are located at two geographically different sites, one for low fusion point crude oil and the other for high one. With two storage sites, two pipelines are needed to transport different types of crude oil. It is difficult to enforce the constraints resulting from high fusion point oil transportation. Reducing such transportation cost is among the most important goals sought by refinery industry. This work for the first time studies this scheduling problem from a control-theoretic viewpoint. Due to the hybrid property of the process, the system is modeled by a hybrid Petri net. With this model, an efficient method is presented to schedule the transportation of high fusion point crude oil.",

Highlighting the need for a holistic solution to the problem of scalable human control of multirobot teams, we present a novel control algorithm with provable guarantees on the robots' motion that lends itself well to input from modern tablet and smartphone interfaces. Concretely, we develop an iOS application in which the user is presented with a team of robots and a bounding box (prism). The user carefully translates and scales the prism in a virtual environment; these prism coordinates are wirelessly transferred to our server and then received as input to distributed onboard robot controllers. We develop a novel distributed multirobot control policy which provides guarantees on convergence to a goal with distance bounded linearly in the number of robots, and avoids interrobot collisions. This approach allows the human user to solve the cognitive tasks such as path planning, while leaving precise motion to the robots. Our system was tested in simulation and experiments, demonstrating its utility and effectiveness.",

Since the dynamics of the resulting closed-loop system are discontinuous, Filippov solutions to non-smooth dynamical systems are introduced. Similar to the existing stability results for triangular formations with precise range measurements, we prove that under coarse range measurements, the convergence to the desired formation is almost global except for initially collinearly positioned formations. More importantly, we are able to make stronger statements that the convergence takes place within finite time and that the settling time can be determined by the geometric information of the initial shape of the formation. Simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the theoretical analysis.",

It includes multi-joint dynamics in generalized coordinates, holonomic constraints, dry joint friction, joint and tendon limits, frictionless and frictional contacts that can have sliding, torsional and rolling friction. The forward dynamics of a 27-dof humanoid with 10 contacts are evaluated in 0.1 msec. Since the simulation is stable at 10 msec timesteps, it can run 100 times faster than real-time on a single core of a desktop processor. Furthermore the entire simulation pipeline can be inverted analytically, an order-of-magnitude faster than the corresponding forward dynamics. We soften all constraints, in a way that avoids instabilities and unrealistic penetrations associated with earlier spring-damper methods and yet is sufficient to allow inversion. Constraints are imposed via impulses, using an extended version of the velocity-stepping approach. For holomonic constraints the extension involves a soft version of the Gauss principle. For all other constraints we extend our earlier work on complementarity-free contact dynamics \u2014 which were already known to be invertible via an iterative solver \u2014 and develop a new formulation allowing analytical inversion.",

The approach can use dense point cloud data from stereo vision or an RGB-D sensor (such as the Microsoft Kinect), as well as visual appearance data as input. The method is a convex relaxation of the classical pose estimation problem, and is based on explicit linear matrix inequality (LMI) representations for the convex hulls of SE(2) and SE(3). Given these representations, the relaxed pose estimation problem can be framed as a robust least squares problem with the optimization variable constrained to these convex sets. Although this formulation is a relaxation of the original problem, numerical experiments indicates that it is indeed exact - i.e. its solution is a member of SE(2) or SE(3) - in many interesting settings. We additionally show that this method is guaranteed to be exact for a large class of pose estimation problems.",

        "abstract": "The idea that connected convex surfaces, separated by concave boundaries, play an important role for the perception of objects and their decomposition into parts has been discussed for a long time. Based on this idea, we present a new bottom-up approach for the segmentation of 3D point clouds into object parts. The algorithm approximates a scene using an adjacency-graph of spatially connected surface patches. Edges in the graph are then classified as either convex or concave using a novel, strictly local criterion. Region growing is employed to identify locally convex connected subgraphs, which represent the object parts. We show quantitatively that our algorithm, although conceptually easy to graph and fast to compute, produces results that are comparable to far more complex state-of-the-art methods which use classification, learning and model fitting. This suggests that convexity/concavity is a powerful feature for object partitioning using 3D data. Furthermore we demonstrate that for many objects a natural decomposition into \u201chandle and body\u201d emerges when employing our method. We exploit this property in a robotic application enabling a robot to automatically grasp objects by their handles.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, robotic systems have been playing an increasingly important role in physiotherapy. The aim of these platforms is to aid the recovery process from strokes or muscular damage by assisting patients to perform a number of controlled tasks, thus effectively complementing the role of the physiotherapist. In this paper, we present a novel learning from demonstration framework for cooperative control in robotic-assisted physiotherapy. Unlike other approaches, the aim of the proposed system is to guide the patients to optimally execute a task based on previously learned demonstrations. This allows the generation of patient-specific gestures under the supervision of the expert physiotherapist. The guidance is performed through stiffness control of a compliant manipulator, where the stiffness profile of the generalized trajectory is determined according to the relative importance of each section of the task. In contrast with the traditional learning approach, where the execution of the generalized trajectory by the robot is automated, this cooperative control architecture allows the patients to perform the task at their own pace, while ensuring the movements are executed correctly. Increased performance of the learning framework is accomplished through a novel fast, low-cost multi-demonstration dynamic time warping algorithm used to build the model. Experimental validation of the framework is carried out using an interactive setup designed to provide further guidance through additional visual and sensory feedback based on the task model. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework, showing a significant improvement in the performance of guided tasks compared to unguided ones.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel use of haptic feedback for human navigation with a mobile robot. Assuming that a path-planner has provided a mobile robot with an obstacle-free trajectory, the vehicle must steer the human from an initial to a desired target position by only interacting with him/her via a custom-designed vibro-tactile bracelet. The subject is free to decide his/her own pace and a warning vibrational signal is generated by the bracelet only when a large deviation with respect to the planned trajectory is detected by the vision sensor on-board the robot. This leads to a cooperative navigation system that is less intrusive, more flexible and easy-to-use than the ones existing in literature. The effectiveness of the proposed system is demonstrated via extensive real-world experiments.",

The mobile agents are assumed to have non-uniform with varying scaling sensing ability around themselves. The nodes' sensor footprint is allowed to be any arbitrary compact planar set, while the coordination scheme accounts for rotation of the latter. The domain sensed by the swarm is partitioned via the proposed distributed scheme that differentiates for standard Voronoi-alike distance-based metrics. The distributed cooperative scheme developed manages to lead the group towards an area-optimal configuration via proper control of the movement and rotation of each sensing node.

By the proposed algorithm, an almost rigid object with non-negligible deformation, such as a cardboard box, a plastic case, etc., is held and manipulated by dual manipulators stably without producing any vibrations. By defining apparent dynamics of dual manipulators for the interface force between the object and its environment and the dissipative dynamics for the internal force applied by the manipulators to the object independently, stable manipulation is achieved. Experimental results illustrate that the vibratory motion of the manipulated object caused by non-negligible deformation is eliminated by the proposed control algorithm while the apparent dynamics of the manipulated object is realized.",

        "abstract": "Obtaining synoptic observations of dynamic ocean phenomena such as fronts, eddies, oxygen minimum zones and blooms has been challenging primarily due to the large spatial scales involved. Traditional methods of observation with manned ships are expensive and, unless the vessel can survey at high-speed, unrealistic. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are robotic platforms that have been making steady gains in sampling capabilities and impacting oceanographic observations especially in coastal areas. However, their reach is still limited by operating constraints related to their energy sources. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) recently introduced in coastal and polar oceanographic experiments have added to the mix in observation strategy and methods. They offer a tantalizing opportunity to bridge such scales in operational oceanography by coordinating with AUVs in the water-column to get in-situ measurements. In this paper, we articulate the principal challenges in operating UAVs with AUVs making synoptic observations for such targeted water-column sampling. We do so in the context of autonomous control and operation for networked robotics and describe novel experiments while articulating the key challenges and lessons learned.",

We recently developed nanomanipulation techniques for the extraction and identification of DNA contained within sub-nuclear locations of a single cell nucleus. In nanomanipulation of DNA, a key step is target identification through SEM-fluorescence correlative imaging. Existing image correlation techniques often require fiducial marks and/or manual feature selection or data training, which are unsuitable for DNA nanomanipulation. This paper presents an approach for correlating SEM-fluorescence microscopy images, proven effective in processing images taken under poor SEM imaging conditions imposed by the necessity of preserving DNA's biochemical integrity. The performance of the image correlation approach under different imaging conditions was quantitatively evaluated. Compared to manual correlation by skilled operators, the automated correlation approach demonstrated an order of magnitude higher speed. The SEM-fluorescence correlation approach enables targeted nanomanipulation of sub-cellular structures under SEM.",

This is achieved by suitably modifying the robot trajectory in the null-space of the servoing task so as to render the camera motion \u2018more informative\u2019 w.r.t. the states to be estimated. As a byproduct, the better 3D structure estimation also improves the evaluation of the servoing interaction matrix which, in turn, results in a better closed-loop convergence of the task itself. The reported experimental results support the theoretical analysis and show the benefits of the method.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We present a novel method for planning 3D coverage paths for inspection of complex structures on the ocean floor (such as seamounts or coral reefs) using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Our method initially uses an a priori map to plan a nominal coverage path that allows the AUV to pass its sensors over all points on the target structure. We then go beyond previous approaches in the literature by considering the vehicle's position uncertainty rather than relying on the unrealistic assumption of an idealized path execution. To this aim, we present a replanning algorithm based on stochastic trajectory optimization that reshapes the nominal path to cope with the actual target structure perceived in situ. The replanning algorithm runs onboard the AUV in realtime during the inspection mission, adapting the path according to the measurements provided by the vehicle's range sensing sonars. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in experiments at sea using the GIRONA 500 AUV where we cover a concrete block of a breakwater structure in a harbor and an underwater boulder rising from 40 m up to 27 m depth. Moreover, we apply state-of-the-art surface reconstruction techniques to the data acquired by the AUV and obtain 3D models of the inspected structures that show the benefits of our planning method for 3D mapping.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a system for crowdsourcing saliency interest points for robotically gathered 3D maps rendered on smartphones and tablets. An app was created that is capable of interactively rendering 3D reconstructions gathered with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle. Through hundreds of thousands of logged user interactions with the models we attempt to data-mine salient interest points. To this end we propose two models for calculating saliency from human interaction with the data. The first uses the view frustum of the camera to track the amount of time points are on screen. The second treats the camera's path as a time series and uses a Hidden Markov model to learn the classification of salient and non-salient points. To provide a comparison to existing techniques, several traditional visual saliency approaches are applied to orthographic views of the models' photo-texturing. The results of all approaches are validated with human attention ground truth gathered using a remote gaze-tracking system that recorded the locations of the person's attention while exploring the models.",

We want to use large swarms of robots to perform manipulation tasks; unfortunately, human-swarm interaction studies as conducted today are limited in sample size, are difficult to reproduce, and are prone to hardware failures. We present an alternative. This paper examines the perils, pitfalls, and possibilities we discovered by launching SwarmControl.net, an online game where players steer swarms of up to 500 robots to complete manipulation challenges. We record statistics from thousands of players, and use the game to explore aspects of large-population robot control. We present the game framework as a new, open-source tool for large-scale user experiments. Our results have potential applications in human control of micro- and nanorobots, supply insight for automatic controllers, and provide a template for large online robotic research experiments.",

While previous research only tackled on a few kinds of leg motions, original human dance leg motions contain various foot touch states such as slide, turn, and heel contact, as well as complex motions such as kick and twist. According to the dance literature, we found that there are seven major foot touch states that make dance motion more \u201cdance-like\u201d. Thus we present a method to classify the seven kinds of foot touch state from human dance motion data, and describe the various dance leg motions by using combinations of the foot touch states and key-frames. Based on these methods, we designed the humanoid dance motion generation system that enables humanoid robots not only to satisfy the geometric condition but also to imitate various human dance leg motions. Finally we show an experiment using a life-sized humanoid, HRP-2.",

We propose two auction-based algorithms to solve this problem in a fully decentralized way. The first approach finds an optimal solution at the cost of high communication complexity; the second approach provides a sub-optimal solution while reducing the computational burden according to a sliding mode parameter \u03b6, yielding a tradeoff between complexity and optimality. A theoretical characterization of the optimality of the first algorithm is provided, and a closed form for the maximum gap between the optimal solution and the sub-optimal solution is also given. Simulation results are presented to corroborate the theoretical findings.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a decentralized algorithm to form arbitrary repeating formations of multiple robots. Methods are known to form specific kinds of repeating structures such as squares, triangles, and hexagons by modeling each robot as a particle that responds to attractive and repulsive forces generated by nearby robots. However, such methods are generally designed by hand for one specific type of lattice. Our approach is more general, in the sense that we present a single algorithm, for which a description of the desired repeating pattern is part of the input. We represent this pattern as a directed graph, in which edges show the desired rigid body transformations between the local frames of pairs of neighbor robots. The robots autonomously organize themselves into a family of rooted trees, and use these trees to perform task assignments locally and without conflicts. We show, via our simulated implementation, that our algorithm works for robot systems with hundreds of robots to form various lattice patterns. Our experiments also show that the approach can recover rapidly from robot failures, even if those failures impact a large fraction of the robot population.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of decentralized goal assignment and trajectory generation for multi-robot networks when only local communication is available, and proposes an approach based on methods related to switched systems and set invariance. A family of Lyapunov-like functions is employed to encode the (local) decision making among candidate goal assignments, under which the agents pick the assignment which results in the shortest total distance to the goals. An additional family of Lyapunov-like barrier functions is activated in the case when the optimal assignment may lead to colliding trajectories, thus maintaining system safety while preserving the convergence guarantees. The proposed switching strategies give rise to feedback control policies which are scalable as the number of agents increases, and therefore are suitable for applications including first-response deployment of robotic networks under limited information sharing. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.",

In this paper, we propose a platooning algorithm based on a near-to-near decentralized approach. Each vehicle estimates and memorizes on-line the path of its predecessor as a set of points. After choosing a suitable position to aim for, the follower estimates on-line the predecessor's path curvature around the selected target. Then, based on a heuristic search, it computes an angular velocity using the estimated curvature. The optimization criteria used in this work allows the robot to follow its predecessor's path without oscillation while reducing the lateral and angular errors.",

Furthermore, decoupling speeds up numerical linearization of the dynamic model. We demonstrate that these state estimators are capable of handling walking on flat ground and on rough terrain.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces an approach to accomplish motion segmentation from a moving stereo camera based on deep learning. Previous work on moving object detection mostly use point features based on 3D geometric constraints. However, point features require good features, and are hard to detect or to be matched correctly in situations where objects have smooth textures. To alleviate this problem, learning high-level spatio-temporal features unsupervisedly from raw image data based on Reconstruction Independent Component Analysis (RICA) autoencoders is proposed. Despite the power of the new spatio-temporal features, these features cannot not learn and be used to interpret 3D geometry of dynamic scenes, which is critical for moving object detection from moving cameras. As detected moving points based on 3D geometric constraints still contain valuable information of 3D scene as well as the camera egomotion, we propose a framework that incorporates both the detected moving point results and the learned spatio-temporal features as inputs to Recursive Neural Networks (RNN) that performs motion segmentation. Both features effectively complement each other. The proposed approach is demonstrated with real-world stereo video data that contains multiple moving objects, and has achieved 26% better detection rate over the existing 3D geometric-based moving points detector.",

        "abstract": "Dense semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds is a challenging task. Many approaches deal with 2D semantic segmentation and can obtain impressive results. With the availability of cheap RGB-D sensors the field of indoor semantic segmentation has seen a lot of progress. Still it remains unclear how to deal with 3D semantic segmentation in the best way. We propose a novel 2D-3D label transfer based on Bayesian updates and dense pairwise 3D Conditional Random Fields. This approach allows us to use 2D semantic segmentations to create a consistent 3D semantic reconstruction of indoor scenes. To this end, we also propose a fast 2D semantic segmentation approach based on Randomized Decision Forests. Furthermore, we show that it is not needed to obtain a semantic segmentation for every frame in a sequence in order to create accurate semantic 3D reconstructions. We evaluate our approach on both NYU Depth datasets and show that we can obtain a significant speed-up compared to other methods.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We propose a method for the computation of entropy decrease in C-space. These estimates are then used to evaluate candidate exploratory trajectories in the context of autonomous mobile robot mapping. The method evaluates both map and path entropy reduction and uses such estimates to compute trajectories that maximize coverage whilst minimizing localization uncertainty, hence reducing map error. Very efficient kernel convolution mechanisms are used to evaluate entropy reduction at each sensor ray, and for each possible robot position and orientation, taking frontiers and obstacles into account. In contrast to most other exploration methods that evaluate entropy reduction at a small number of discrete robot configurations, we do it densely for the entire C-space. The computation of such dense entropy reduction maps opens the window to new exploratory strategies. In this paper we present two such strategies. In the first one we drive exploration through a gradient descent on the entropy decrease field. The second strategy chooses maximal entropy reduction configurations as candidate exploration goals, and plans paths to them using RRT\u2217. Both methods use PoseSLAM as their estimation backbone, and are tested and compared with classical frontier-based exploration in simulations using common publicly available datasets.",

The somatosensory control functions are also implemented for a human rider to drive the robot on flat ground as a personal vehicle instinctively. In order to face front whether climbing up or down stairs, the robot is designed with proper mechanical structure and mass distribution. Moreover, the perception and control methods of descending stairs are modified from the methodologies of ascending stairs in our previous works so that the robot can handle both ascending and descending stairs effectively under similar principles. As for the somatosensory control part, the functions of controlling the robot to move back and forth using the rider's body motion is realized, which has more advantages than Segway PT since it can stand still when the rider wants the platform to stop moving, and the robot motion under the control of the human rider is stable enough for indoor applications. In the experiments, the stair-climbing abilities and somatosensory control functions are both successfully demonstrated, which proves that the design and implementation of the robot system are feasible and efficient. We are looking forward for more functions and applications of the robot, including our ultimate goal of carrying a human rider to climb stairs in an erect way with somatosensory control simultaneously.",

Inspired by human limbs, robotic manipulators with internal compliance can perform high-quality force/torque control and better human-robot interaction. This paper presents a robotic wrist whose size, range, and torque output are comparable to those of a human wrist. To achieve two collocated and perpendicular axes of compliant actuation, two linear compliant couplers are proposed. Through slider crank and spherical mechanisms, the linear elasticity is converted to rotary elasticity to control the pitch and yaw torques at the same time. This new compact design realizes series elastic actuation in both axes without increasing size and complexity. Static and dynamic models of the compliant wrist are developed to analyze the motion. Through experiments of a prototype, the wrist is shown to achieve accurate and fast force/torque control. We expect this novel compliant wrist to serve as an alternative for applications involving human-robot interaction.",

We designed and fabricated a novel SEA as the primary joint actuator which is compact, adjustable and low-cost. Meanwhile an additional elastic unit is installed in parallel with the SEA to improve energy utilization by storing and releasing energy during motion cycles. An adaptive stable controller is designed to realize the joint following motion to a virtual limb. The algorithm can identify and compensate the undetermined contact stiffness between the joint output and the virtual limb. Finally, the performance of the actuator is evaluated through motion tracking and energy-conservation experiments. Preliminary results indicate the validity of the design and imply its potential usage in lower limb exoskeletons.",

        "abstract": "Asymmetric-tip, robotically controlled steerable needles have the potential to improve clinical outcomes for many needle-based procedures by allowing the needle to curve and change direction within biological tissue. Algorithms have previously been developed to change the curvature of the needle trajectory via duty-cycled spinning. However, these algorithms require continuous rotation of the steerable needle, preventing the use of instrumentation such as force-torque sensors and electromagnetic trackers, due cable wind-up issues. In this paper, we present two novel control methods for duty-cycling a steerable needle without the need for continuous rotation: bidirectional duty-cycled spinning and duty-cycled flipping. These algorithms can be implemented on existing robotic needle steering systems without hardware changes. We evaluate our algorithms using a custom hollow steerable needle, with an embedded EM tracker and a force-torque sensor. We compare the path tracking error, needle insertion forces, and needle axial rotation torques of our algorithms and found no significant differences between the two algorithms in terms of tracking error. Duty-cycled flipping has significantly lower mean insertion forces and torques than bidirectional duty-cycled spinning, and differences in insertion force and rotation torque variability were also found.

        "abstract": "NASA Ames Research Center is developing a compliant modular tensegrity robotic platform for planetary exploration. In this paper we present the design and evolution of the platform's main hardware component, an untethered, robust tensegrity strut, with rich sensor feedback and cable actuation. Each strut is a complete robot, and multiple struts can be combined together to form a wide range of complex tensegrity robots. Our current goal for the tensegrity robotic platform is the development of SUPERball, a 6-strut icosahedron underactuated tensegrity robot aimed at dynamic locomotion for planetary exploration rovers and landers, but the aim is for the modular strut to enable a wide range of tensegrity morphologies. SUPERball is a second generation prototype, evolving from the tensegrity robot ReCTeR, which is also a modular, lightweight, highly compliant 6-strut tensegrity robot that was used to validate our physics based NASA Tensegrity Robot Toolkit (NTRT) simulator. Many hardware design parameters of the SUPERball were driven by locomotion results obtained in our validated simulator. These evolutionary explorations helped constrain motor torque and speed parameters, along with strut and string stress. As construction of the hardware has finalized, we have also used the same evolutionary framework to evolve controllers that respect the built hardware parameters.",

Using a single sheet of polyester and a laser cutter, the hexapod robot can be fabricated and assembled in less than one hour from scratch. No screw or other external tools are required for assembly. The robot has built-in polyester fasteners considered in its crease pattern. The design uses four-bar mechanisms, which makes the robot flexible to be adjusted for different speeds or other task metrics. For a given desired locomotion velocity, various parameters of the four-bar mechanisms in the crease pattern can be modified accordingly. Design flexibility, ease of fabrication, and low cost make the robot suitable as an agent for swarm objectives. This work presents the foldable hexapod design and its kinematic analysis. The robot is fabricated, assembled, and tested for functionality. Experimental results show that the robot prototype runs with a maximum forward speed of 5 body lengths per second and turns in place with a speed of 1 revolution per second. The final robot weighs 42 grams.",

As compared with dual-servo stages, it allows the reduction on the cost of both hardware and control design workload. The compliant stage is devised using leaf springs to achieve a large stroke. Strain sensors are employed to provide coarse and fine resolutions in the larger and smaller motion ranges, respectively. Analytical models are developed to facilitate the quantitative design of the motion ranges and coarse/fine resolution ratio. The motor selection criteria in terms of driving force and stroke are addressed as well. The models are verified through simulations with finite element analysis. A proof-of-concept prototype is fabricated for experimental investigations. The feasibility of the proposed idea is validated by a collection of experimental studies.",

We explore the role of the diamond configuration in avoiding nonminimum phase behavior and we examine the best vehicle aspect ratios for this type of robot design. We use a degree of controllability metric to illustrate the uncontrollable behavior of certain designs and also identify an optimal aspect ratio of 1.4. The paper concludes by incorporating these lessons into a new 5 degree-of-freedom prototype robot that provides substantial improvements over previous designs. This robot uses centrifugal pumps and fluidic valves to achieve high maneuverability and unique motions such as forward and reverse motions, sway translations, and turning in place. In addition, this design can achieve improved forward efficiency through the use of dual output-pumps and can perform these planar motions at various vehicle depths through the use of a closed loop depth control system.",

        "abstract": "Both postural maintenance and rhythm generation are keys to generating adaptive behavior in all animals. This is particularly evident in soft animals such as caterpillars, worm and flatworms that are capable of moving freely in all directions and adopting intricate postures. They can also exploit three-dimensional deformations and nonlinear structural properties to move in complex environments and to respond to external forces. These capabilities have inspired a new interest in using soft materials in robotic applications but highly deformable materials create significant design and control problems. In previous work the authors have developed a 3D-printed soft (3D-PS) robot, inspired by caterpillars, as a platform to investigate methods for controlling soft robots. The previous version of the robot is able to reproduce the different gait patterns (inching and crawling motion) of caterpillars by changing temporal difference in the rhythmic deformations of different body parts. In this paper, we have added posture control to the 3D-PS robot together with a steering capability. Experimental results show that although posture and steering are usually related, elastic and continuum properties of the soft body can produce more complex and versatile behaviors.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes RoboTerp, a quadrupedal amphibious robot that achieves locomotion on land and in water with the same legs by switching gaits to match the terrain. The central idea hinges on a passive compliant mechanism attached to the lower leg that enables it to behave like a valve during movement in water. The direction of this valve-like mechanism is aligned such that rhythmic oscillations of the legs generate a net thrust that propels the robot forward in water. By design, this oscillatory leg movement achieves splash-free swimming, and thereby overcomes the shortcomings of most previous wheel-leg based designs, in which rotational movement causes water splashing that leads to significant turbulence in the robot surroundings. We examined different materials and morphological parameters to select the best flap configuration. A modular design allowed rapid iterations of these experiments. We confirmed the performance of the best few configurations found during the experiments through fluid simulations. Finally, we report successful demonstrations of RoboTerp walking on asphalt land, swimming in a pool, and transitioning between uneven rock surface and water in an outdoor creek.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In order to increase the workspace size of parallel robots (largely reduced by the presence of singularities) several solutions have been proposed. One promising solution consists in the definition of optimal trajectories that ensure the non degeneracy of the dynamic model in the singularity and therefore are able to cross the Type 2 singularities. Those works are based on the computation of the optimal trajectories and assume that the robot can perfectly track the desired trajectory. Nevertheless, this assumption cannot be verified in reality due to modelling errors which largely impact the control law used to follow the desired trajectory. Therefore, if the optimal trajectory is not perfectly tracked, the dynamic model can degenerate near the Type 2 singularities and the robot might stay blocked. In order to solve that problem, this paper proposes a multimodel approach that allows parallel robots to cross the Type 2 singularities without any torque discontinuity. The main idea is to shift near singularities from the full robot dynamic model to another simplified one that can never degenerate. The proposed control law is then coupled with an optimal trajectory planning methodology that makes the singularity crossing more robust to modelling errors. The proposed approach is validated experimentally on a prototype of Five-bar planar parallel mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Parallel surface contact between the template and the substrate is very important in imprint lithography. In this paper, a novel force-decoupled compound parallel alignment stage is proposed for high-resolution imprint lithography. It mainly consists of a high-stiffness spherical air bearing (SAB) and a multi-degree-of-freedom (multi-DOF) flexure-based mechanism that functions for both the active and passive alignments. Apart from the function of the parallel alignment, the proposed stage can also endure a large imprinting force of more than 1000 N but does not cause any damage to the delicate components, which is mainly attributed to its force-decoupled characteristic. Through the stiffness modeling and finite element analysis (FEA), the performance is evaluated to satisfy the design requirement. Finally, experimental tests are conducted on the parallel alignment stage for the hot embossing process, and the grating patterns with linewidth of 2.5 \u03bcm are successfully transferred from the silicon template to the polymethy methacrylate (PMMA) substrate. This result demonstrates that the proposed stage can be used in the hot embossing process without degrading its alignment accuracy.",

The proposed design integrates the camera's fixation and manipulation together by adjusting a 3D rotational magnetic field from a stator outside a patient's body. The stator generates both torque to rotate the inside rotor dome in all three dimensions, and force to serve as an anchoring system that keeps the camera steady during a surgical procedure. This design eliminates the need for an articulated design and therefore the integrated motors to significantly reduce the size of the camera. A set of stator and rotor designs are developed and evaluated by simulations and experiments.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of urbanization and motorization in China, fatigue driving has become an increasingly serious road traffic problem. Driving fatigue affects drivers' alertness, decreasing an individual's ability to operate a vehicle safely and increasing the risk of human error that could lead to fatalities, which have been widely recognized as critical safety issues that cut across all modes in the transportation industry. In this paper, firstly, with a virtual driving system we developed, driving simulation experiments were designed to collect subjects' electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and mental fatigue data. To detect drivers' mental state in real time, wavelet-packets transform (WPT) was selected to extract continuous features; then, the subjective evaluation combined with video monitoring was used to evaluate driver's mental state in experiment accurately. At last, with fatigue feature as the input and fatigue state as the output, driving fatigue detection model can be constructed by classification methods. In this paper, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to build driving fatigue detection model to estimate mental fatigue state of EEG signal features, and the binary classification accuracy can be achieved up to 88.6207%.",

        "abstract": "Motivated by the needs to develop dexterous flexonic mobile node (FMN) for structural health monitoring where obstacle avoidance is among the most challenging tasks, this paper presents a novel FMN design for navigating on iron-based structures. Unlike most existing magnetic wheel designs, the FMN uses fixed-magnet configuration contributing to smooth motion, self-maintained orientation and automatic negotiation of concave corners. Taking into account of several stringent considerations (including tight dimension, efficient attachment and manipulation flexibility) to facilitate avoidance of structural obstacles in tight space, a prototype FMN incorporating a compliant beam (that results in more DOFs than designs with multiple links and pin/ball joints), along with a 3-step strategy for negotiating a convex corner, has been developed. Although controlling a continuous deforming beam is challenging given limited number of actuators, both simulation and experimental results confirm a simple input/output relation between the rear axle displacement and front axle rotation, which is anticipated to facilitate control implementation of FMN for obstacle avoidance.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses the control strategies for robot manipulators to track moving targets based on realtime vision guidance. The work is motivated by some new demands of vision guided robot manipulators in which the workpieces being manipulated are in complex motion and the widely adopted look-then-move control strategy cannot give satisfactory performance. In order to serve industrial applications, the limited sensing and actuation capabilities have to be considered properly. In our work, a cascade control structure is introduced. The sensor and actuator limits are dealt with by consecutive modules in the controller respectively. In particular, the kinematic visual servoing (KVS) module is discussed in detail. It is a kinematic controller that generates reference trajectory in real-time. Sliding control is used to give a basic Jacobian-based design. Constrained optimal control is applied to address the actuator limits. validation is conducted through simulation and experiment.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, an optimization method for designing MR clutches is studied. The proposed method optimizes the geometrical dimensions of an MR clutch, hence its mass, for given output torque and electrical input power. The main idea behind this optimization is that the input power and output torque are two parameters that are normally known to the designer prior to the design of an MR clutch and considering these parameters in the optimization as fixed values has a practical significance. Having presented the optimization method, we compare the characteristics of three different MR clutch configurations in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. A comparison between the drum, single-disk and multi-disk configurations of MR clutches is performed. Using the proposed method one can select a suitable configuration as well as the geometrical dimensions for an MR clutch that best suits the requirements of each individual design.",

        "abstract": "Bone-attached robots and so-called microstereo-tactic frames are attracting increasing interest in the field of robot-assisted surgery due to the promising targeting accuracy they provide. The authors propose a passive Stewart-Gough platform which is attached to a patient's head via bone anchors. It serves as an instrument guidance in straight line incisions, such as minimally invasive cochlear implantation. In this contribution a modified version of the mechanism's kinematics is proposed, which reduces the number of required bone anchors from six to three. Furthermore, a novel statistical approach to optimize the design variables of the moving platform for accuracy is presented. It is characterized by the ability to take the probability distributions of all relevant error sources as well as the given task redundancy and reconfigurability of the mechanism into account. Based on identified ranges of trajectories and possible bone anchor locations, the optimization problem is solved for a representative number of 1,000 \u2018virtual patients\u2019. The optimum mechanism design is obtained by analyzing the resulting distributions of design variables. Monte Carlo simulation is used to compare its targeting errors to those of a previous prototype. Results reveal that the targeting error is significantly reduced in comparison to an initial prototype thanks to the proposed optimization strategy.",

Their social and economic relevance is more than evident. Yet, while much has been researched about \u201cdesigning robots\u201d focusing on sensing, actuation, mobility and control of service robots, little work has been done on \u201cdesign for robots\u201d that looks at designing preferred artefacts or environments for such robots. In this work, we propose a new philosophy of robot inclusive spaces, a cross disciplinary approach that brings together roboticians, architects and designers to solve numerous unsettled research problems in robotics community through design of inclusive interior spaces for robots where the latter live and operate. With a residential floor cleaning robot as a case study, we inductively derived a set of four design principles namely observability, accessibility, activity and safety that guides the realization of an inclusive space for these service robots. Also, the suggested principles are further defined, analysed and validated for their merits in this paper.",

The resulting sensor features a detachable fingertip made of 3D-printed materials, and a cantilever mechanism that allows the detection of contact forces via three off-the-shelf, low-cost force sensors. To improve our design concept, optimization on the configuration of the fingertip sensor is performed under statistical analysis of the hysteresis performance. The optimized fingertip sensor is experimentally investigated and calibrated. At the end, through a case-study, we demonstrate that our proposed design can measure the direction of contact forces in the radial plane of the fingertip sensor.",

In order to endure such ability to a robot, this paper presents an algorithm for detecting potential falling objects, i.e. physically unsafe objects, given an input of 3D point clouds captured by the range sensors. We formulate the falling risk as a probability or a potential that an object may fall given human action or certain natural disturbances, such as earthquake and wind. Our approach differs from traditional object detection paradigm, it first infers hidden and situated \u201ccauses (disturbance) of the scene, and then introduces intuitive physical mechanics to predict possible \u201ceffects (falls) as consequences of the causes. In particular, we infer a disturbance field by making use of motion capture data as a rich source of common human pose movement. We show that, by applying various disturbance fields, our model achieves a human level recognition rate of potential falling objects on a dataset of challenging and realistic indoor scenes.",

However, it is difficult to recognize coil springs randomly placed in a pile by conventional machine vision techniques because of their shape characteristics. In this paper, we propose a method of recognition and pose estimation of coil springs. This method uses their highlights made by illumination for their recognition and pose estimation with stereo vision. We implemented this method as a bin-picking system with an industrial robot. Bin-picking of coil springs was successfully demonstrated on the system. Position errors were less than 2 mm. The average success rate for a coil spring in the part box was 94% when multiple retrials of picking were allowed. This rate could be improved by implementation of collision avoidance.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a biomimetic robotic fish that swims using thunniform kinematics for advanced underwater mobility. Propulsion and maneuvering of the robotic fish are achieved with a lunate caudal fin that undergoes combined translational and rotational motion. A parallel four-bar propulsive mechanism attached to the rear of the rigid torpedo-shaped body is used to deliver motor rotation to the caudal fin. Oscillatory control signals for the tail joints are generated with a CPG controller composed of two unidirectionally coupled Hopf oscillators. Coupling terms that allow direct specification of phase relation between oscillators are formulated. The maximum speed of the robotic fish can reach 2.0 m/s and excellent maneuverability has been exhibited. The outstanding swimming performances present exciting possibilities for real-world deployment of the robotic fish.",

In this case, they require high load operations such as gripping and conveyance of heavy load, and holding people at the care spot. However, these operations are difficult for existing humanoids because of their low joint output. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop the highoutput life-size humanoid robot. We first designed a motor driver for humanoid with featuring small, water-cooled, and high output, and it performed higher joint output than existing humanoids utilizing. In this paper, we describe designed humanoid arm and leg with this motor driver. The arm is featuring the designed 2-axis unit and the leg is featuring the water-cooled double motor system. We demonstrated the arm's high torque and high velocity experiment and the leg's high performance experiment based on water-cooled double motor compared with air-cooled and single motor. Then we designed and developed a life-size humanoid with these arms and legs. We demonstrated some humanoid's experiment operating high load to find out the arm and leg's validity.",

To achieve this, we developed a novel laser range scanner that scans the surrounding environment three dimensionally, and formulated lightweight algorithms for the sensor.

We developed a tendon-driven system which has the advantage of placing electronic devices protected in the arm's base part which stays out of the reactor container, and only few expensive highly radiation hardened sensors and tools are mounted in the arm tip. Generation of large joint torque is necessary to realize such a very long arm. We applied the concept of coupled tendon-driven mechanism formerly used to generate restricted two dimensional motions, and extended its concept by proposing a new joint arrangement which makes possible three dimensional motions in a large workspace. Mechanical design, compact storage method and derivation of the arm motion control are detailed. Moreover, we built a preliminary mechanical prototype called \u201dMini 3D CT-Arm\u201d, and the experimental results demonstrated the validity of the newly proposed concept.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel hybrid actuator with controllable mechanical damping. It has been developed to provide subsequently the actuation means for haptic interfaces that can demonstrate intrinsic passive performance when rendering hard contacts. The overall actuator is a dual actuation system where one actuator is responsible for generating the joint motion while the second is dedicated to regulating the physical damping through a semi-active friction mechanism. This semi active friction mechanism applies a purely dissipative torque on the joint, which can be continuously controlled to render damping levels ranging from completely free to heavily damped and even a completely locked joint. The present work focuses mainly on the mechatronic details of the actuator design and in particular on the modelling and control of the damper. The proposed variable damping mechanism is evaluated in a simple 1-DOF joint. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate that the unit is capable of replicating physical damping with adequate performance.",

        "abstract": "Recent work on probe-based confocal endomicroscopy has demonstrated its potential role for real-time assessment of tumour margins during breast conserving surgery. However, endomicroscope probes tend to have a very small field-of-view, making surveillance of large areas of tissue difficult, and limiting practical clinical deployment. In this paper, a new robotic device for controlled, large area scanning based on a fibre bundle endomicroscope probe is proposed. The prototype uses a 2-DOF mechanism (\u221290 to +90 degrees bending on one axis, 360 degrees of rotation on a second axis) as well as a passive linear structure to conform to undulating surfaces. Both axes are driven by brushless DC servo motors with computer control, thus facilitating large field-of-view mosaicing. Experimental results have shown good repeatability and low hysteresis of the device, which is able to scan different surface trajectories (e.g. a spiral pattern over a hemi-spherical surface) with consistent tissue contact. Ex vivo human breast tissue results are demonstrated, illustrating a viable scanning approach for breast endomicroscopy.",

Until now, most ICEA surgeries have been manually performed with traditional instruments. This paper presents a smart surgical robot (SSR) for ICEA surgery. The robot is composed of two slave arms, each consisting of a positioning manipulator and a surgical tool manipulator. The positioning manipulator uses a selective compliance assembly robot arm (SCARA) and a screw-pair mechanism to achieve translational movement in 3D space, and the surgical tool manipulator uses a \u201cdouble screw drive + universal joint\u201d structure to allow an omni directional bending motion. During surgery, the surgeon first creates the workspace manually to explore the target esophagus. The SSR system is then applied to perform operation. The configuration of the SSR means it can perform tissue manipulation under endoscopic view in a small workspace. Experimental results show that the endoscopic view permits the SSR system to be operated intuitively and accurately in the target workspace.",

        "abstract": "Colonoscopy is an important procedure for the diagnosis of various pathologies, in particular cancer of the colon and of the rectum. However, colonoscopy is a procedure often painful for the patient and complex for the doctor. So in the biomedical field, a wireless microrobot in pipe that can move smoothly in water or aqueous medium has urgently been demanded. In this paper, we developed a new kind of wireless microrobot with symmetrical spiral structure, which also had symmetrical kinematic characteristics. According to the hydromechanical lubrication theory and Newton viscous law, we build the motion model of the microrobot, which will provide a theoretical basis on designing the optimal structure parameters of the microrobot. Through analysis, simulations and experiments, this paper had evaluated the effect of spiral angle, which could realize forward-backward, upward-downward motion and stopping at any position we need in the pipe. In addition, we obtained the moving speeds of forward-backward and upward-downward motion in the pipe. The experimental results indicated that the maximum moving speed is 36.5 mm/s at 14 Hz in the horizontal direction and 4.6 mm/s at 16Hz in the vertical direction with input currents of 0.7A. Finally, we designed a control panel for this system, which can control the microrobot current motion states intuitively and easily, and make our system more portable and compact. The developed wireless microrobot can move smoothly in water and other liquid medium and is very useful in the industrial.",

This paper presents the design of a novel three Degrees-of-Freedom (DOF) robot manipulator based on the DASA actuation approach. The robot is developed as a proof-of-concept prototype intended to demonstrate the capacity of the DASA approach to achieve a high degree of interaction safety as well as performance. Magneto-Rheological (MR) clutches form the basis of the Semi-active actuation component, while a unidirectional motor provides the active drive for the robot. An antagonistic clutch configuration is implemented at the joints to achieve bi-directional actuation without reversal of the motor. MR clutches have been shown to exhibit excellent torque-to-inertia and torque-to-mass ratios making them likely candidates for the development of human-safe actuators. In this paper, the safety characteristics of the DASA approach are qualitatively discussed. Experimental results highlighting the performance capability of the developed robot are given.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents new methods to develop a running long jump for a simulated humanoid robot. Starting from a steady-state running motion, a new spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) based 3D template model for a running jump is presented. The use of this model is motivated by a simpler model from biomechanics which describes the dynamics of human long jumpers in the sagittal plane. While previously only used to describe the thrust step of a long jump, this type of model is also shown to generate useful Center of Mass (CoM) trajectories to return to steady-state running upon landing. A principled optimization approach for this new template is described to generate reference CoM trajectories for maximum span which are able to be kinematically and dynamically retargeted to the humanoid. The key features of an optimal long jump are highlighted, and a task-space control approach to realize the motion on a humanoid is summarized. A video attachment to this paper shows an optimal long jump for a 6 m/s approach speed, where the humanoid is able to clear a large gap, and highlights the effects of non-optimal takeoff-velocity angles.",

        "abstract": "Bio-actuated, especially flagellated bacteria-driven, micro/nanorobots have been actively studied to develop novel technologies such as drug delivery systems (DDS), though the characteristics of the actuator (flagellar motor) have not been sufficiently investigated. For analysis or control of the bacterial flagellar motor, we previously proposed the local environmental control system with nano/micro dual pipettes to dynamically generate arbitrary local ion/reagent concentration change. In the result, transient-state and steady-state of local Na+ concentration were manipulated with high facultativity. However, in this system, over time, the local ion/reagent could not be fully flushed out due to the increase of the diffusion rate caused by high external (in the bath) ion/reagent concentration. Therefore, in this paper, to achieve more arbitrary local environmental control, we propose the local environmental control system by combination of microfluidic chip with world-to-chip interface (WtCI) and pipette. We fabricate the WtCI microfluidic chip by two-step photolithography, and develop the system by using precisely controllable syringe pump. And, we demonstrate the basic feasibility of the local environmental control system by combination of WtCI microfluidic chip and pipette.",

We propose a control technique which integrates the use of palm and fingers to pick up a given object on the table, to drop it on a specific spot on the palm, and to let it roll continuously and controllably on the palm, subject to the gravitational and contact forces. We formulate a simple and fast algorithm to control the tilting angle of the palm based on the conservation of mechanical energy and an empirical model of energy dissipation due to collisions. We also develop a multifingers controller for stable grasp and for correcting the rolling motion. The proposed technique is demonstrated on a simulated robotic hand manipulating a wide range of objects with different geometry and physical properties.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers straight line path following control of wheel-less planar snake robots using sliding mode techniques. We first derive the Poincar\u00e9 representation of the equations of motion of the robot using the techniques of differential geometry. Furthermore, we use partial feedback linearization to linearize the directly actuated part of the system dynamics. Subsequently, we propose an analytical solution to the robust path following control problem in two steps. In the first step, we use sliding mode techniques to design a robust tracking controller for the joints of the robot to track a desired gait pattern. In the second step, we stabilize an appropriately defined sliding manifold for the underactuated configuration variables of the robot, thereby guaranteeing convergence of the robot to the desired straight path. The paper presents simulation results which validate the theoretical results.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper details the development of a tracking controller for a highly dynamic parallel orientation manipulator that is capable of achieving high angular acceleration. The adopted control algorithm is derived from the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) technology. The ADRC algorithm must be evaluated on the control hardware at a frequency consistent with the dynamics of the system without creating any inter-channel latency for a successful implementation. In this regard, the field programmable gate array (FPGA) is preferred because of its superior speed and parallelism. While there is a clear demand for FPGA controllers in the military and the aerospace domain because of the improved SWaP (size, weight, and power) capabilities, the literature provides a few examples of such controllers that mostly employ expensive high logic density FPGA chips. In contrast, this paper describes how an advanced controller can be efficiently prototyped on a relatively low-cost, low logic density FPGA hardware. The controller was tested in a co-simulation approach (wherein the digital implementation of the control algorithm and the dynamics of the manipulator are simulated together) to ensure a robust FPGA implementation. In addition, a hardware evaluation was also conducted using a linear voice coil actuator under varying inertial loads. Experimental results obtained from the simulation study and hardware testing confirm the robust performance of the designed controller.",

The focus is on discrete optimal control methods which operate intrinsically in the state space system manifold and do not require coordinate charts or projections. This is accomplished by defining both the dynamics and the optimal control solution as sequences of vector fields mapping to curves on the Lie group through retraction maps, and defining variations and differentiation with respect to such vector fields. As a result, standard trajectory optimization methods can be easily extended to the Lie group setting without loss of efficiency. The methods are illustrated with three numerical examples: a quadrotor, an aerial vehicle with manipulators, and a simple nonholonomic system.",

Given a second-order inverse differential scheme that realizes instantaneously a desired task acceleration and has some specified properties in terms of joint acceleration or torque, define a discrete-time joint velocity command that shares the same characteristics under suitable hypotheses. The goal is to obtain simpler implementations of possibly complex robot control laws that i) can be directly interfaced to the low-level servo loops of a robot, ii) require less task information and on-line computations, iii) are still provably good with respect to some target performance. The method is illustrated by considering the conversion into discrete-time velocity commands of control schemes for redundant robots that minimize the (possibly, weighted) norm of joint acceleration or joint torque, or that add null-space damping to overcome floating motion of the robot joints.

Our approach first projects features and class labels onto a shared latent structure space, and then generates a discriminative and low-dimensional input to a discriminative dictionary learning framework. LS-DDL learns a more discriminative and lower-dimensional dictionary than existing dictionary learning methods. Therefore we obtain high recognition accuracy with a small number of low-dimensional dictionary atoms. The low dimensionality also improves the efficiency in storage and testing. In addition, the latent structure projection eliminates the classifier weighting parameter in existing discriminative dictionary learning approaches. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach through a series of experiments on image-based face recognition and video-based activity recognition. Our results show that the proposed approach obtains much higher recognition accuracy with a small number of dictionary atoms, and costs much less computational time than state-of-the-art methods.",

Assuming that the robots have limited, range-based communication and target-sensing capabilities, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for ensuring distance optimality when robots and targets are uniformly randomly distributed. We then provide an explicit, non-asymptotic formula for computing the number of robots needed for guaranteeing optimality in terms of the robots' sensing and communication capabilities with arbitrarily high probabilities. The bound given in the formula is also asymptotically tight. Due to the large number of robots needed for high-probability optimality guarantee, we continue to investigate strategies for cases in which the number of robots cannot be freely chosen. We show that a properly designed strategy can be asymptotically optimal or suboptimal with constant approximation ratios.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Environmental monitoring, an important application for robots, has begun to be addressed recently with linear least squares regression techniques because they estimate the values of measured attributes and their uncertainty. But several challenges remain when performing adaptive sampling in a communication-constrained distributed multi-robot setting. When the attributes of interest evolve over time (as is natural for many environments) any non-homogeneous spatial variability may necessitate continual re-modeling of the field dynamics and/or re-sampling of the field. This raises questions about the robots' division of labor and workload balance that can be difficult to address when sample information is not stored centrally. This paper tackles these coordination problems efficiently by introducing a sub-division-based modeling technique appropriate for distributed decision-making. We augment Ordinary Kriging to enable representation of a field's (potentially non-homogeneous) evolution through Bayes filtering that characterize the underlying dynamics. This approach not only enables adaptive path planning in the field, but the sub-divided areas lead to a straightforward formulation of the optimal workload distribution through modification of an approximate graph partitioning algorithm. Using a simulated multi-robot sampling scenario, we demonstrate and validate the approach. The experiments show good performance in terms of cross-validation using real values and illustrate how hotspots are identified and modeled, in turn affecting the division of labor.",

        "abstract": "Due to the competition for limited resources by many concurrent processes in large scale automated manufacturing systems (AMS), one has to resolve a deadlock issue in order to reach their production goal without disruption and downtime. Monolithic resolution is a conventional approach for optimal or acceptable solutions, but suffers from computational difficulty. On the other hand, some decentralized methods are more powerful in finding approximate solutions, but most are application-dependent. By modeling AMS as Petri nets, we develop an innovative distributed control approach, which can create a trajectory leading to a desired destination and are adaptable to different kinds of constraints. Control strategies are applied to processes locally such that they can concurrently proceed efficiently. Global destinations are always reachable through the local observation upon processes without knowing external and extra information. Efficient algorithms are proposed to find such distributed controllers.",

        "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the main causes of severe traffic accidents occurring in our daily life. In order to reduce the number of drowsiness-induced accidents, various researches have been conducted with the aim of finding practical and non-invasive drowsiness detection systems by using behavioral measuring techniques. Many of the previous works on behavioral measuring techniques have mainly focused on the analysis of eye closure and blinking of the driver. It is recently that more attention started to shift to inclusion of other facial expressions and only few, among those researches, have been done on the analysis of temporal dynamics of facial expressions for drowsiness detection. In this paper we propose a new method of analyzing the facial expression of the driver through Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based dynamic modeling to detect drowsiness. We have implemented the algorithm using a simulated driving setup. Experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Here, we treat the problem of designing motion primitives for cooperative manipulation such that the robots move in formation and are robust with respect to external disturbances. Individual robot trajectories are generated by Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) and coupled by a formation control approach enabling the DMP-trajectories to preserve a given formation while performing the manipulation. The proposed control scheme achieves an increased adaptability under external disturbances. The approach is evaluated in a full-scale experiment with two prototypical cooperative manipulation and synchronized motion tasks.",

        "abstract": "Aiming to design a soft robotic fish with more natural, more flexible and high-performance movements through biomimetic method, we are developing a soft robotic fish with body/caudal fin (BCF) propulsion by using piezoelectric fiber composite (PFC) as actuator. Compared with conventional rigid robotic fish, the design and control of the soft robotic fish are difficult and hard to reveal its dynamic performances due to the large deformation of flexible structure and complicated coupling dynamics with fluid. That's why the design and control method of the soft robotic fish has not been established, and we need to study it by considering the interaction between flexible structure and fluid. In this paper, fluid-structural coupling analysis based on acoustics method is applied to consider the fluid effect and predict the dynamic responses of soft robotic fish using PFC in fluid. Basic driving and governing equations of soft robotic fish in the fluid are firstly described. Then the numerical acoustics coupling analysis is performed. The calculated results are congruent well with experiments on dynamic responses. Finally, based on this coupling method, a new prototype of soft robotic fish is proposed by optimization for improvement.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents computational and experimental analyses on flight dynamics of Flapping Micro Air Vehicles (FWMAV) employing a novel flapping mechanism, denoted as AIFM (Asymmetric In-phase Flapping Mechanism). This mechanism was designed to achieve controlled, asymmetric in-phase wing flapping inspired by nature's flyers. This paper extends our previous study where modeling and optimization of such a mechanism was carried out. The dynamic effects of asymmetric in-phase flapping motion during forward flight are our main focus in this study. Kinematics and rigid body dynamics modeling are first carried out to derive the equations of motion of the system, followed by aerodynamic modeling of wing using blade element theory and quasi-unsteady analysis techniques. The analysis deals with three configurations of the system: symmetric in-phase flapping motion (C0) versus asymmetric in-phase flapping motion (C+5, C-5). Scaled model of AIFM was fabricated and implemented into a FWMAV to show its practical feasibility. Some of the key dynamic effects of AIFM are addressed, suggesting AIFM solely can generate aerodynamic forces and moments which have the potential to bring higher agility and controllability to existing FWMAV platforms.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Active constraints and virtual fixtures are popular control strategies used within human-robot collaborative manipulation tasks, particularly in the field of robot-assisted surgery. Recent research has shown how active constraints, which robotically regulate the motion of a tool that is primarily manipulated by a human, can be implemented in dynamic environments which change and deform throughout a procedure. In a dynamic environment, movement of the constraint boundary can cause active forcing of the surgical tools, potentially reducing the surgeon's control and jeopardising patient safety. Dynamic frictional constraints have been proposed as a method for enforcing dynamic active constraints which do not generate energy of their own, and simply dissipate or redirect the energy of the surgeon to provide assistance. In this paper, dynamic frictional constraints are reformulated to allow formal proof that they are indeed dissipative, and hence also passive. This new formulation is then extended such that dynamic frictional constraints can simultaneously constrain the position and orientation of a tool. Experimental results show that the method is of significant benefit in performing a dynamic task when compared to cases without any assistance; with position and orientation constraints individually and with a conventional frictional constraint without energy redirection.",

The Space robots are always built in very light for saving the launch energy. The flexibility of the joints and links is considerable arising from its elasticity. Controlling this manipulator is more complex than controlling one with rigid joints due to the interactions of rigid and flexible motion, in which only a single actuation signal can be applied at each joint and has to control the flexure of both the joint itself and the link attached to it. To discussing an under-actuated flexible-link flexible-joint space manipulator, a free-flying space manipulator with one flexible link and two flexible revolute joints is presented in this paper. The dynamical Lagrange equation is established, and a singularly perturbed model has been formulated and used for designing a reduced-order controller. This controller consists of a rigid control component and two fast control components. Numerical simulations show that the link and joint vibrations have been stabilized effectively with good tracking performance.",

A compact parallel mechanism, used for grasping and releasing microob-jects, was utilized for generating controllable vibration to overcome the strong adhesion forces between the end effector and the manipulated object. To reach the required acceleration of the end effector, which is necessary for the detachment of the target object, vibration in the end effector is generated by applying sinusoidal voltage to the PZT actuator of the parallel mechanism. For the necessary acceleration, we focus on the frequency of the vibration, while keeping the amplitude of the PZT actuator vibration small (14 nm) to achieve precise positioning. Releasing of microbeads and biological cells is conducted and results are compared for the first time. The effect of the air and liquid environments are also investigated. Successful releasing (97.5%) of biological cells proves that the proposed active releasing method is an appropriate solution for the adhered biological cells during the releasing task.",

The proposed method makes use of band-width matrix, combines particle filter and mean shift with a new strategy, avoids falling into local optimum, and maintains particle diversity with only a few sampled points. A fast object searching strategy is successfully used to find the missing object. Experiments show that the proposed method runs robustly in complex scenes. The object 3-D parameters relative to the camera center can be estimated with a RGB-D camera, and that makes significant sense in spatial localization.",

        "abstract": "A pneumatic actuator with solenoid valves is a discontinuous-input system because each valve can be either in on or off state. For such an actuator, this paper proposes a sliding-mode control scheme based on an averaged continuous-input equivalent model for the open-loop system. The averaged model is obtained from the nonlinear dynamics of the open-loop discontinuous-input system undergoing pulse-width-modulation (PWM) at the input (i.e., valve open/close action). The PWM duty cycle will be regarded as a continuous input to the proposed averaged model, and thus generated by the proposed sliding-mode controller. By adjusting the PWM duty cycle, the controller switches between seven modes of operation of the open-loop system in order to select the ones with necessary and sufficient amounts of drive energy to achieve position tracking. We will show that this results in reduced position error and valve switching activity for the actuator. The proposed control scheme is experimentally used in the position control of a pneumatic actuator and the results are presented.",

The proposed method builds upon our previous results on task-constrained motion planning with moving obstacles. With respect to our previous formulation, the inclusion of bounds on the available actuator torques leads to the adoption of an acceleration-level motion generation scheme. Therefore, the new planner must operate in a task-constrained state space extended with time. The generated trajectories are collision-free, obey velocity and torque bounds, and satisfy the task constraint with arbitrary accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by results on various scenarios involving a 7-dof manipulator.",

The novel approach addresses dynamic walking on inclined surfaces by dividing the walking motion into two phases: transition and incline walking. During the transition phase, the humanoid robot performs a 3-dimensional movement in order to transfer its body between surfaces of different inclinations, which is then followed by the incline-walking phase. The transition phase is less trivial to execute than the incline walking itself. In this paper, we first formulate the equations of a 3D (non linear) Inverted Pendulum, and then we derive an equivalent model. Subsequently, we introduce a trajectory generator based on this model and validate it experimentally by performing, with COMAN, dynamic transitions from the horizontal ground to a 10\u00b0 slope.",

        "abstract": "A lower limb rehabilitation robot, namely iLeg, has been developed recently. Since active exercises have been proven to be effective for neurorehabilitation and motor recovery, they are suggested to be implemented on iLeg. To this goal, patients' motion intention should be recognized. Therefore, a method based on the dynamic model of the human-robot interface (HRI) is designed to recognize the human motion intention. This paper is devoted to modeling and identifying the dynamics of the HRI. Firstly, the dynamic model of the HRI is designed by combining the dynamic models of the human leg and iLeg, where the human leg dynamic model (HLDM) is mainly concerned. By considering the motion trajectories during the rehabilitation exercises provided by iLeg, the human leg can be taken as a manipulator with two degrees of freedom; meanwhile, the joint angles and torques of the human leg can be measured indirectly by using the position and torque sensors mounted on the joints of iLeg. As a result, an 8-parameter HLDM can be designed by using the Lagrangian method. Then, the dynamic model of the HRI is identified by respectively and independently identifying the undetermined dynamic parameters of iLeg and the HLDM, where the dynamic parameters of the HLDM are mainly considered. Finally, the feasibility of the dynamic model of the HRI is validated by experiments.",

        "abstract": "Failure detection and correction is essential in robust systems. In robotics, failure detection has focused on traditional parts assembly, tool breakage, and threaded fastener assembly. However, not much work has focused on sub-mode failure classification. This is an important step in order to provide accurate failure recovery. Our work implemented a novel failure characterization scheme for cantilever snap assemblies. The approach identified exemplars that characterized salient features for specific deviations from a nominal trajectory. Then, a rule based approach with statistical measures was used to identify failure and classify failure sub-modes. Failure sub-mode classification was evaluated by using a reliability measure. Our work classified failure deviations with 88% accuracy. Varying success was experienced in correlating failure deviation modes. Cases with only 1-deviation had 86% accuracy, cases with 2-deviations had 67% accuracy, and cases with 3 deviations had 55% accuracy. Our work is an important step in failure characterization of complex geometrical parts and serves as a stepping stone to enact failure recovery.",

        "abstract": "Sandy terrains are widely distributed on this planet and include desert, beach, and area affected by volcanic eruption where covered with ash. Currently, these environments still present a challenge for mobile robots due to their poor trafficability. One of the most essential requirements on such terrains for mobile robots is to generate enough drawbar pull with a small amount of slippage. For this purpose, protrusions or convex patterns called lugs (i.e. grousers) are attached on the wheels. However, oscillational drawbar pull generated by lugs results vibration of the robot body and therefore disturb the stability of the robot. In this paper, we aim to reduce the oscillation of the drawbar pull by proposing a novel wheeled mechanism integrated with an actively actuated lug. The drawbar pull on the sandy terrain in fabricated testbed is firstly measured on a prototype mechanism. Based on measured force, a strategy of tuning sinkage length of the active lug for generating stable drawbar pull is proposed. This method has the advantage of that it requires neither prior knowledge on terramechanic models nor physical properties of the terrain. The performance of the proposed method is finally verified by comparing the generated drawbar pull with that of a wheel with a fixed lug.",

        "abstract": "A number of applications of wheeled robots, including planetary exploration rovers and rescue missions, require that the vehicle operates in a non-structured environment. Optimizing the vehicle mobility is of key importance in such applications. Reduced mobility can limit the ability of the robot to achieve the mission goals, or even render it immobile in extreme cases. In this paper, the effect of normal contact forces on mobility is reported. A performance indicator based on the force distribution is defined and used to compare different vehicle configurations. The validity of this indicator was assessed using both simulation and experimental results obtained for a six-wheel rover prototype. Results suggest that modifying the robot configuration to alter the normal force distribution can lead to increased traction force available at the wheel-terrain interfaces, thus improving the mobility.",

        "abstract": "Endowing mobile manipulation robots with skills to use objects and tools often involves the programming or training on specific object instances. To apply this knowledge to novel instances from the same class of objects, a robot requires generalization capabilities for control as well as perception. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach to deformable registration of RGB-D images that enables robots to transfer skills between object instances. Our method provides a dense deformation field between the current image and an object model which allows for estimating local rigid transformations on the object's surface. Since we define grasp and motion strategies as poses and trajectories with respect to the object models, these strategies can be transferred to novel instances through local transformations derived from the deformation field. In experiments, we demonstrate the accuracy and runtime efficiency of our registration method. We also report on the use of our skill transfer approach in a public demonstration.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new method for efficient and exact collision-checking of linear motions of 3-D rigid bodies. 3-D rigid bodies have 6-D configuration spaces (three degrees of freedom for position and three for orientation), and constitute an important subclass of motion planning problems. Our method can be used with any collision-checker that is capable of performing linear transformations and distance computations on 3-D geometry. As previous work has shown, computing the distance between the rigid body in some configuration and the workspace obstacles immediately determines the collision-status of surrounding configurations. Using a recursive procedure one can then determine exactly whether an entire motion of the rigid body is collision-free. In this paper, we will show that by performing an optimally selected linear transformation on the workspace, the collision-status of rigid body motions can be determined using significantly fewer (costly) distance computations. Since collision-checking is often the computational bottleneck in sampling-based motion planning, our approach allows for significant performance improvements of algorithms such as PRM and RRT when planning for 3-D rigid bodies. We demonstrate the benefit of our approach when used in combination with RRT to construct a planning tree in an illustrative benchmark motion planning scenario.",

Inspiration is drawn from the vision of UAVs that are capable of autonomously executing industrial activities, or effectively reconfiguring their environment via forceful interaction. Therein, the technical shortcomings of the potential utilization of conventional underactuated UAV platform designs are examined, in terms of operational effectiveness-versus-safety. The innovative implementation of the direct thrust-vectoring authority of tiltrotor UAV types for forceful interaction is proposed, and its associated technical contributions are analyzed. A methodology is developed for controlled forward thrust force and rotating moment exertion, while ensuring safe operation near the hovering attitude pose. A large force-requiring scenario is assembled, consisting of a realistically-sized object laid on solid ground, regarded as a path-hindering obstacle to be forcefully removed by the UAV via pushing manipulation. To this purpose, a high-end autonomous tiltrotor UAV is employed in order to achieve this environment modification task, relying on a properly synthesized control structure.",

Recent advances in dense RGB-D mapping have led to maps of increasing size and density. Segmentation of these raw maps is a first step for higher-level tasks such as object detection. Current popular methods of segmentation scale linearly with the size of the map and generally include all points. Our method takes a previously segmented map and segments new data added to that map incrementally online. Segments in the existing map are re-segmented with the new data based on an iterative voting method. Our segmentation method works in maps with loops to combine partial segmentations from each traversal into a complete segmentation model. We verify our algorithm on multiple real-world datasets spanning many meters and millions of points in real-time. We compare our method against a popular batch segmentation method for accuracy and timing complexity.",

Most existing RO-SLAM techniques consider beacons as passive devices disregarding the sensing, computing and communication capabilities they are actually endowed with. This paper proposes a Range-Only scheme based on Sparse Extended Information Filters (SEIF) that efficiently exploits their capabilities. The robot computes the SLAM prediction stage and distributes the update stage among beacons within its sensing area. The proposed scheme naturally integrates robot-beacon and inter-beacon measurements, significantly improving map and also robot estimations. Our scheme inherits from SEIF its efficiency and scalability and further reduces robot computational burden by exploiting the beacons computing capability.

        "abstract": "This paper addresses ego-motion noise suppression for a robot. Many methods use motion information such as position, velocity and acceleration of each joint to infer ego-motion noise. However, such inference is not reliable since motion information and ego-motion noise are not at all times correlated. We propose a new framework for ego-motion noise suppression based on single channel processing without using any explicit motion information. In the proposed framework, ego-motion noise features are estimated in advance from an ego-motion noise input with Infinite Non-negative Matrix Factorization (INMF) which is a non-parametric Bayesian model. After that, the proposed Semi-Blind INMF(SB-INMF) is applied to an input signal consisting of both the target and egomotion noise signals. The ego-motion noise features which are obtained with INMF are used as input to the SB-INMF and treated as the fixed features to extract the target signal. Finally, the target signal is extracted using newly-estimated features with SB-INMF. The proposed framework was applied to ego-motion noise suppression on two types of humanoid robots. Experimental results showed that ego-motion noise was suppressed well compared to a conventional template-based egomotion noise suppression method using motion information, and thus it worked properly on a robot which does not have an interface to provide the robot's motion information.",

This matrix considers the effect of both cable mass and elasticity. Dynamic response functions are evaluated for cable-driven parallel manipulators. As an example, the dynamic analysis of a 6-DOF cable-suspended parallel manipulator is achieved considering the dynamic behavior of sagging cables. Numerical simulations and tests are demonstrated to validate the model by identifying the natural frequencies. Effects of cable sag on the static pose error are also experimentally investigated. Results show the importance of taking into consideration the cable dynamics for cable-driven parallel manipulators when it comes to perform applications such as high speed pick-and-place or large working volume.",

        "abstract": "Factor graphs are a general estimation framework that has been widely used in computer vision and robotics. In several classes of problems a natural partition arises among variables involved in the estimation. A subset of the variables are actually of interest for the user: we call those target variables. The remaining variables are essential for the formulation of the optimization problem underlying maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation; however these variables, that we call support variables, are not strictly required as output of the estimation problem. In this paper, we propose a systematic way to abstract support variables, defining optimization problems that are only defined over the set of target variables. This abstraction naturally leads to the definition of smart factors, which correspond to constraints among target variables. We show that this perspective unifies the treatment of heterogeneous problems, ranging from structureless bundle adjustment to robust estimation in SLAM. Moreover, it enables to exploit the underlying structure of the optimization problem and the treatment of degenerate instances, enhancing both computational efficiency and robustness.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a study of end-point impedance measurement at human hand, with professional and novice manual welders when they are performing Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding interactively with the KUKA Light Weight Robot Arm (LWR). The welding torch is attached to the KUKA LWR, which is admittance controlled via a force sensor to give the feeling of a free floating mass at its end-effector. The subjects perform TIG welding on 1.5 mm thick stainless steel plates by manipulating the torch attached to the robot. The end-point impedance values are measured by introducing external force disturbances and by fitting a mass-damper-spring model to human hand reactions. Results show that, for professionals and novices, the mass, damping and stiffness values in the direction perpendicular to the welding line are the largest compared to the other two directions. The novices demonstrate less resistance to disturbances in this direction. Two of the professionals present larger stiffness and one of them presents larger damping. This study supports the hypothesis that impedance measurements could be used as a partial indicator, if not direct, of skill level to differentiate across different levels of manual welding performances. This work contributes towards identifying tacit knowledge of manual welding skills by means of impedance measurements.",

        "abstract": "Inertial actuators, such as reaction wheels, have the potential to improve the stability and robustness of bipedal robots. While the stabilizing capabilities of reaction wheels follow naturally from physical laws, the effects on walking efficiency are less clear. This work examines those effects by comparing energy-optimal periodic gaits for a variety of under-actuated, five-link planar biped configurations. When energy consumption is normalized by total mass, bipeds equipped with reaction wheels have decreased walking cost compared to unequipped bipeds of the same mass across a wide range of conditions. At speeds equal to or higher than the optimal walking speed, reaction wheels can reduce walking cost by approximately 8%. When walking with large step lengths, reaction wheels decrease walking costs by more than 20% and allow bipeds to take longer steps. Efficiency improvements scale with the momentum capacity of the reaction wheel, but saturate for particularly large reaction wheels.",

It identifies the gust front associated with the rear-flank downdraft of the supercell thunderstorm as an interesting candidate for such a mission, and examines the potential for soaring in the region. This knowledge is combined with sampling techniques employed in previous field experiments to produce an energy efficient path at an altitude and location identified as an interesting area for in situ sampling. The path is tested using a flight through simulated storm data, and is shown to provide a net positive gain in energy to the vehicle. This encouraging result indicates the possibility of extending the sampling mission from its current limited length to a significant portion of the storm evolution, a capability that could provide invaluable information about the causes of tornadogenesis.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper considers the design and optimization of an autonomous electromechanical control and energy scavenging system for the wind-propelled Moball, a spherical mobile sensor platform concept [1, 2]. This mechanism converts mechanical motion to electrical energy, and the same mechanism can function as an actuator to self-generate motion. Simulations of a simplified model on flat ground show that a 2m diameter Moball operating in typical Arctic conditions can generate 1. 8-2.7W of power continuously while being wind-propelled. We also demonstrate a simple motion control algorithm, showing that self-propulsion in windless conditions requires 1-1.5W. Hence, using this mechanism, a Moball can self-generate sufficient energy for long duration missions involving self-propulsion, sensing, and communication in harsh, cold, windy climates (e.g., Polar regions on Earth, or the surface of Titan or Mars) where solar energy may be limited. Simulations with key design parameters are also used to draw general conclusions regarding optimal design for energy recovery. The addition of springs inside the generating mechanism greatly increases the range of wind speeds over which Moball can harvest energy.",

        "abstract": "Whirligig beetle, claimed in the literature to be one of the highest measured for a thrust-generating apparatus within the animal kingdom, has evolved a series of propulsion strategies that may serve as a source of inspiration for designing highly efficient propulsive systems. First, a robotic platform was developed to test an energy-efficient propulsion mechanism inspired by the whirligig beetle. Second, a mathematical model for the robot was proposed to account for the fluid dynamics generated by the robotic swimming. Third, an optimal problem was formulated and solved for the propulsor and beating pattern design. The results indicated that soft middle, stiff end propulsor, and alternating, asymmetrical beating pattern will improve the propulsion efficiency for a swimming robot with four propulsors. Finally, simulation and experiments were conducted to further analyze the effect of beating pattern to the robotic propulsion efficiency. It was found that the oscillated body movement and S-shaped trajectory introduced by the optimal beating pattern would improve the propulsion efficiency for the designed robot.",

        "abstract": "Ergonomic and human-centered approaches are increasingly important in the design of surgeon-machine interfaces. In the case of microsurgeries, the procedures suffer from susceptibility to variation in surgeon skill and equipment characteristics. This paper presents a novel, computer-assisted surgical interface for laser-based microsurgeries, called the \u201c\u03bcRALP Surgical System\u201d. With the system, surgeries can be performed with improved safety and precision using a three-part architecture: (i) a 3D viewer device providing stereoscopic visualization; (ii) a graphics stylus that controls a motorized micromanipulator for laser aiming and activation; and (iii) a configuration interface allowing system setup and modifications in real-time. The system combines the advantages of a computer-assisted platform while respecting the visualization and manipulation requirements of a microsurgical procedure. The features include intraoperative planning for automatic laser incisions and ablations as well as safety regions based on virtual overlays in the surgeon's field-of-view. A comparative evaluation of the proposed system against the traditional system points to the clear superiority of the new interface. The quantitative comparison shows that the proposed interface is safer, more precise, and better controlled. The qualitative comparison demonstrates that the interface is easier to use, easier to learn, and has a minimal training requirement. The technological advances presented here shall lead to enhanced interfaces, increasing the capacity of surgical systems through user-centered design approaches.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The aim of a mobile robot path tracking algorithm is to ensure that the desired path is followed as accurately as possible. This problem has been intensively studied in literature with satisfactory results in on-road context. Nevertheless, performances may be depreciated when the expected ideal conditions are no longer satisfied, as it is the case when moving off-road: in such a context, bad grip conditions together with actuator saturations may generate significant perturbations, especially at high speed. Beyond a lack of accuracy, instabilities (such as spin around or non-controllability) may arise. This paper proposes an adaptive and predictive approach in order to preserve the path tracking stability thanks to the modulation of the robot velocity. Relying on the on-line observation of the grip conditions and the reference path properties, the maximal velocity admissible in a near future is computed and applied, if necessary, instead of the desired speed. A steering angle control law, designed to be independent of the robot speed, acts in parallel. The capabilities of this algorithm are tested through actual experiments with a mobile off-road platform.",

The goal is to reduce risk, both to the robot and the environment, by asking context-appropriate questions. Given an input program, (i.e., a sequence of commands) the system evaluates a set of likely alternate programs along with their likelihood and cost, and these are given as input to a Decision Function to decide whether to execute the task or confirm the plan from the human partner. A process called token-risk grounding identifies the costly commands in the programs, and specifically asks the human user to clarify those commands. We evaluate our system in two simulated robot tasks, and also on-board the Willow Garage PR2 and TurtleBot robots in an indoor task setting. In both sets of evaluations, the results show that the system is able to identify specific commands that contribute to high task cost, and present users the option to either confirm or modify those commands. In addition to ensuring task safety, this results in an overall reduction in robot reprogramming time.",

        "abstract": "Markov localization and its variants are widely used for localization of mobile robots. These methods assume Markov independence of observations, implying that observations made by a robot correspond to a static map. However, in real human environments, observations include occlusions due to unmapped objects like chairs and tables, and dynamic objects like humans. We introduce an episodic non-Markov localization algorithm that maintains estimates of the belief over the trajectory of the robot while explicitly reasoning about observations and their correlations arising from unmapped static objects, moving objects, as well as objects from the static map. Observations are classified as arising from long-term features, short-term features, or dynamic features, which correspond to mapped objects, unmapped static objects, and unmapped dynamic objects respectively. By detecting time steps along the robot's trajectory where unmapped observations prior to such time steps are unrelated to those afterwards, non-Markov localization limits the history of observations and pose estimates to \u201cepisodes\u201d over which the belief is computed. We demonstrate non-Markov localization in challenging real world indoor and outdoor environments over multiple datasets, comparing it with alternative state-of-the-art approaches, showing it to be robust as well as accurate.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Estimating human fingertip forces is required to understand force distribution in grasping and manipulation. Human grasping behavior can then be used to develop force-and impedance-based grasping and manipulation strategies for robotic hands. However, estimating human grip force naturally is only possible with instrumented objects or unnatural gloves, thus greatly limiting the type of objects used. In this paper we describe an approach which uses images of the human fingertip to reconstruct grip force and torque at the finger. Our approach does not use finger-mounted equipment, but instead a steady camera observing the fingers of the hand from a distance. This allows for finger force estimation without any physical interference with the hand or object itself, and is therefore universally applicable. We construct a 3-dimensional finger model from 2D images. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are used to predict the 2D image to a 3D model transformation matrix. Two methods of CNN are designed for separate and combined outputs of orientation and position. After learning, our system shows an alignment accuracy over 98% on unknown data. In the final step, a Gaussian process estimates finger force and torque from the aligned images based on color changes and deformations of the nail and its surrounding skin. Experimental results shows that the accuracy achieves about 95% in the force estimation and 90% in the torque.",

        "abstract": "The challenging task of navigating in cluttered environments has been studied extensively with indoor autonomous mobile robots. However, few approaches attempt to estimate real-valued costs for manipulating said obstacles with no prior knowledge of the environment. Our approach not only estimates these costs but also models the uncertainty inherent in making such estimates. We present an algorithm that, with no prior knowledge of the environment, allows a mobile robot to determine which obstacles are movable and which are not while navigating a cluttered environment. The algorithm also applies this knowledge of manipulability to obstacles encountered in the future that are similar in appearance to ones previously seen. Using our approach, a mobile robot can act intelligently about uncertain information as well as successfully navigate initially unknown indoor environments without relying on human-provided information.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel technique for estimating stiffness distribution of a soft tissue using a prototype of air-float stiffness probe. The air-float stiffness probe uses an indentation technique to estimate tissue stiffness. It consists of a spherical indenter and an indentation depth sensing mechanism that operates under a supply of compressed air. The probe has the ability to estimate tissue stiffness in non-planner tissue profiles. A novel technique to estimate indentation force, using supply air pressure is described and validated using both experimental procedures and finite element analysis (FEA) techniques. FEA package, ANSYS CFX was used for analyzing in 2D the solid-fluid interactions within the probe to estimate force available at the indenter at different supply air pressure settings. Both the experimental results and numerical simulations suggest that there is a very strong linear correlation between the indentation force and the supply air pressure. This relationship is used to estimate the indentation force in real time during an indentation test. Verification tests carried out on simulated silicon samples showed that the probe is capable of estimating tissue stiffness values with high accuracy and repeatability.",

Together with automatic mapping of the input device to corresponding motion axes, our approach provides a very intuitive method for controlling the telemanipulation system while reducing the mental workload of the operator and therefore the amount of erroneous commands. Similar principles apply for controlling the viewpoint of real or virtual cameras to facilitate manipulation or navigation tasks.",

We extend our previous open-loop formulation (and its solution) of the game to incorporate more realistic settings: a pursuer with uncertain position and evaders with limited turning rates. The formulation provides a guaranteed lower bound on the team survival time. The survival time performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through extensive simulations and compared to that of the existing approaches. It is shown to be highly effective even when the evaders can not detect the pursuer. A noticeable trend of potentially practical importance is that larger teams benefit more from an increase in turning rates than smaller teams.",

        "abstract": "We present the D-eDVS- a combined event-based 3D sensor \u2014 and a novel event-based full-3D simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm which works exclusively with the sparse stream of visual data provided by the D-eDVS. The D-eDVS is a combination of the established PrimeSense RGB-D sensor and a biologically inspired embedded dynamic vision sensor. Dynamic vision sensors only react to dynamic contrast changes and output data in form of a sparse stream of events which represent individual pixel locations. We demonstrate how an event-based dynamic vision sensor can be fused with a classic frame-based RGB-D sensor to produce a sparse stream of depth-augmented 3D points. The advantages of a sparse, event-based stream are a much smaller amount of generated data, thus more efficient resource usage, and a continuous representation of motion allowing lag-free tracking. Our event-based SLAM algorithm is highly efficient and runs 20 times faster than realtime, provides localization updates at several hundred Hertz, and produces excellent results. We compare our method against ground truth from an external tracking system and two state-of-the-art algorithms on a new dataset which we release in combination with this paper.",

        "abstract": "In present days, the number of application in which robots and users share the same workspace is increasing, as long as the need of cooperation between them. To achieve a smooth cooperation, in particular in surgical applications, the robot needs to timely change its behavior to adapt to the needs of the user. In this work, a simplified scenario for neurosurgery was defined in which the user interacts with the robot through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and by touching the robot links and, based to those events and on the current status, different control modes are enabled in the high level controller we developed, such as autonomous, cooperative and teleoperation. Experiments were performed to measure the performances and safety of the developed high level controller in handling the transitions between two states by checking the continuity of data from the robot and from an external measurement system. Results proved that the trajectories of the end effector and links during the switching phase are continuous and thus the modular high level controller developed switches control safely without undesired deviation from desired course.",

Our system consists of (a) an autonomous mobile robotic platform, (b) on-board actuators and multiple (neuromorphic) sensors, and (c) the SpiNNaker computing system, a configurable neural architecture for exploration of parallel, brain-inspired models. The simulation of neurally inspired perception and reasoning algorithms is performed in real-time by distributed, low-power, low-latency event-driven computing nodes, which can be flexibly configured using C or specialized neural languages such as PyNN and Nengo. We conclude by demonstrating the platform in two experimental scenarios, exhibiting real-world closed loop behavior consisting of environmental perception, reasoning and execution of adequate motor actions.",

The framework allows to emulate various behaviors by prioritized task-space motion, joint torque, and contact force optimization. Moreover, a methodology is introduced to partially excite the natural dynamics of the robot by open-loop motor regulation while the entire behavior is stabilized by hierarchical OSC. As a major contribution, the presented control strategies are tested and validated in real hardware walking, trotting, and pronking experiments using a fully torque controllable quadrupedal robot.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the idea of employing constraints to expand the workspace of Underactuated Flexible Manipulators (UFM). The constraints are divided into two types: bilateral constraint (BC) and unilateral constraint (UC). Under the constraints the UFM is segmented into two sections: the anterior constrained section and the distal free section; moreover, the motion of the UFM is altered, i.e., the end effector of the UFM can get access to positions where unreachable previously, or, the workspace is expanded. In the paper, constrained kinematics model is developed at first. The workspace is derived thereafter. To validate the idea, an underactuated wire-driven serpentine manipulator is built. In the experiments, the two types of constraints are applied. Experiment results agree well with the simulation results.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Non-linear error minimization methods became widespread approaches for solving the simultaneous localization and mapping problem. If the initial guess is far away from the global minimum, converging to the correct solution and not to a local one can be challenging and sometimes even impossible. This paper presents an experimental analysis of dynamic covariance scaling, a recently proposed method for robust optimization of SLAM graphs, in the context of a poor initialization. Our evaluation shows that dynamic covariance scaling is able to mitigate the effects of poor initializations. In contrast to other methods that first aim at finding a good initial guess to seed the optimization, our method is more elegant because it does not require an additional method for initialization. Furthermore, it can robustly handle data association outliers. Experiments performed with real world and simulated datasets show that dynamic covariance scaling outperforms existing methods, both in the presence and absence of data association outliers.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a systematic method for experimental characterization of Bowden cable friction. A novel tension measurement method using a motion capture system and a spring is introduced. With the tension measurement method, the effects of nine variables on friction are investigated. Experimental results show that i) a combination of 7\u00d719 FEP-coated stainless steel cable and double-sheaths has the highest force transmission efficiency; ii) smaller coefficient of friction material, smaller cable moving speed, shorter cable length, longer clamp distance, stiffer cable/sheath all help to increase the force transmission efficiency; and iii) the static friction pretension ratio only decreases as the coefficient of friction of cable/sheath decreases or as cable/sheath stiffness increases. We have generated guidelines for the Bowden cable performance which may help robotics researchers in choosing materials for the Bowden cables and designing control systems for actuation.",

They are implemented and tested on a tendon-driven two-finger setup equipped with two tactile BioTac\u00ae sensors. Several experiments are conducted to evaluate each approach.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first such evaluation of model-based adaptive tracking control for underwater vehicles during simultaneous dynamic motion in all 6 degrees-of-freedom. This experimental evaluation revealed the presence of unmodeled thruster dynamics arising during reversals of the vehicle's thrusters, and that the unmodeled thruster dynamics can destabilize parameter adaptation. The three major contributions of this paper are: an experimental analysis of how unmodeled thruster dynamics can destabilize parameter adaptation, a two-step adaptive model-based control algorithm which is robust to the thruster modeling errors present, and a comparative experimental evaluation of adaptive model-based control and proportional derivative control for fully-actuated underwater vehicles preforming simultaneous 6 degree-of-freedom trajectory tracking.",

The focus is on the adhesive's performance on micro-rough surfaces, which has a large number of applications in robotic mobility and manipulation such as climbing, perching, and grasping. Performance was characterized using shear/normal adhesion pressure limit curves and comparing the new hybrid adhesive to each individual adhesive mechanism and a control. Results show that the electrostatic directional dry adhesive generally performs better than a directional dry adhesive, but that on several surfaces, an electrostatic adhesive with no fibrillar mechanism performs the best. Additionally, the paper introduces a new mechanism that maintains an adhesive's compliance on micro-rough surfaces while transmitting shear and normal forces to a rigid structure. The mechanism is experimentally compared to a rigid backing and a gecko-like hierarchical suspension layer. Results show that the mechanism performs the best when subjected to mainly normal loads, but a hierarchical suspension handles shear loads better.",

This paper reports an experimental evaluation and comparison of the two systems range, static positioning error, trajectory accuracy of single finger and hand motions, and latency. Latency and trajectory accuracy were found superior using the Leap system. KinectTM/3Gear was found superior when larger range and gesture control are necessary. 3Gear was used in a simulated surgical positioning task and demonstrated an average translational accuracy of 6.2mm. Given the data we have collected, we conclude that neither system, at present, possesses the high level of accuracy and robustness over the required range that would be a prerequisite for use as a medical robotics master.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we experimentally investigated the effect of robot fingertip stiffness on friction during grasping of an object. To make robots more human-friendly, robotic hands with soft surfaces have been developed. A soft fingertip, i.e., one with low stiffness, is considered desirable because it produces high friction. However, in our experiments, we were able to obtain high friction from a stiff fingertip under a certain condition. We initially investigated the maximum resistible force when solid objects with different angled surfaces were grasped by spherical fingertips of different stiffness. When the contact surface was flat, a stiffer fingertip produced larger frictional force. When the contact surface was highly convex, the maximum frictional force increased with decreasing fingertip stiffness. Secondly, we examined the relationships among the contact area, the load, and the maximum frictional force. We reformulated the relationship between the load and the maximum frictional force and, together with our experimental results, used it to determine the factor that increased the maximum frictional force.",

        "abstract": "This paper demonstrates that singular configuration of a two-link robot arm is advantageous in doing the task of pulling or lifting up a heavy object with small joint torques. As a result of numerical optimization, the initial configuration that minimizes the joint torques necessary for the task is close to the singular configuration where the arm is stretched out. The singular configuration has the dynamic feature that the joint angle vector can be accelerated in a certain direction almost independently of the mass of the object. Then, the joint torques can generate large kinetic energy efficiently at the singular configuration, and the energy can be utilized to pull or lift up the object. The experimental results show that the dynamic feature is practically useful, even when a feedback control is applied in order to make the object follow a planned trajectory.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Human shows remarkable skills in reactive balancing control on unknown disturbances while standing and walking. Though current bipedal robots can walk, run and step obstacles, they normally perform in a well-controlled environment. Unexpected perturbations can cause the tumbling of bipedal robots when they possess limited capability of rejecting disturbances. Studies upon neurology and psychophysics of human stance attempt to trace how the human deals with external disturbances. This paper introduces a methodology for disturbances estimation and compensation (DEC) for bipedal robot during standing. Previous psychophysical studies of human self-motion perception indicate that humans estimate and compensate disturbances as follows: firstly, multi-sensory inputs are fused to provide explicit measures and then the estimations of the external disturbances are performed based on them. Then, the estimations are fed into a local feedback control loop, compensating the disturbances. Thus, an approach of disturbance estimation and compensation is developed according to the psychophysical aspects of human. Various experiments, for instance, standing on a rotating plate with varying frequency and amplitudes and continuous external contact forces upon the torso of a bipedal robot, are implemented. Through analyzing and verifying the experimental results on a simulated biped, one can state that the DEC approach successfully serves the bipedal robot during perturbed stance.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Many researchers have employed some form of teleoperated leader to influence a robotic swarm; however, the way in which this influence is conveyed has not been well studied. Some researchers employ designated leaders that are known to be leaders by other members of the swarm and hence followed. Others do not impose a leader/follower distinction on the swarm's algorithms and instead choose to influence the swarm indirectly through controlling one or more of its members. Because the robustness of swarm behavior arises from its many distributed interactions, influence through designated leaders might render it susceptible to noise or disrupt its coherence by overriding these mechanisms. Conversely, limiting human influence to indirect control through the local effects of a leader might prove too sluggish to allow effective human control. This paper compares leader-based methods of each type, designated as Tacit leadership via consensus (no explicit leader/follower distinction) and Explicit leadership via flooding (influence propagating from leader takes precedence). These methods were compared in simulation and in human experiments finding that explicit leadership led to faster convergence in simulation and better performance in the experiments. Effects of noise were slightly more pronounced for Explicit leaders and cohesion slightly poorer.",

The collision-free subset of the robot's configuration space is simply connected or it might have several connected components. The robot is a differential drive system shaped as a disc. The robot has limited sensing, namely it is incapable of measuring any distance or angle, or performing self localization. The exploration problem consists in discovering the environment with the robot's sensor. To solve this problem, a motion policy is developed based on simple sensor feedback and a complete exploration strategy is represented as a Moore Machine. The proposed exploration strategy guarantees that the robot will discover the largest possible region of the environment. Consequently, the robot will find the landmark or declare that an exploration strategy to find it does not exist.",

The resulting continuous global frontier surface completely describes unexplored regions and, inherently, provides an automatic stop criterion for a desired sensitivity.

The resulting triangulation is a physical data structure that is a: compact representation of the workspace, contains distributed knowledge of each triangle, builds the dual graph of the triangulation, and supports reads and writes of auxiliary data. Our algorithm builds a triangulation in a closed two-dimensional Euclidean environment, starting from a single location. It provides coverage with a breadth-first search pattern and completeness guarantees. We show that the computational and communication requirements to build and maintain the triangulation and its dual graph are small. We then present a physical navigation algorithm that uses the dual graph, and show that the resulting path lengths are within a constant factor of the shortest-path Euclidean distance. Finally, we validate our theoretical results with experiments on triangulating a region with a system of low-cost robots. Analysis of the resulting triangulation shows that most of the triangles are of high quality, and cover a large area. Implementation of the triangulation, dual graph, and navigation all use communication messages of fixed size, and are a practical solution for large populations of low-cost robots.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous robots often require domain knowledge to act intelligently in their environment. This is particularly true for robots that use automated planning techniques, which require symbolic representations of the operating environment and the robot's capabilities. However, the task of specifying domain knowledge by hand is tedious and prone to error. As a result, we aim to automate the process of acquiring general common sense knowledge of objects, relations, and actions, by extracting such information from large amounts of natural language text, written by humans for human readers. We present two methods for knowledge acquisition, requiring only limited human input, which focus on the inference of spatial relations from text. Although our approach is applicable to a range of domains and information, we only consider one type of knowledge here, namely object locations in a kitchen environment. As a proof of concept, we test our approach using an automated planner and show how the addition of common sense knowledge can improve the quality of the generated plans.",

We present a method for learning relational kinematic background knowledge from exploratory interactions with the world. As the robot gathers experience, this background knowledge enables the acquisition of kinematic world models with increasing efficiency. Learning such background knowledge, however, proves difficult, especially in complex, feature-rich domains. We present a novel, task-sensitive relational rule learner and demonstrate that it is able to learn accurate kinematic background knowledge in domains where other approaches fail.

Two dimensional laser scan points do not have enough feature information for motion tracking. For this reason, additional image sensors or artificial landmarks have been used to find a relative pose. We propose the method to estimate a relative pose of 2D laser sensors without any additional sensor or artificial landmark. By scanning two orthogonal planes, we utilize only the coplanarity of the scan points on each plane and the orthogonality of the plane normals. Experiments with both synthetic and real data show the validity of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge this works provides the first solution for the problem.",

        "abstract": "\u201cIn-hand manipulation\u201d is the ability to reposition an object in the hand, for example when adjusting the grasp of a hammer before hammering a nail. The common approach to in-hand manipulation with robotic hands, known as dexterous manipulation [1], is to hold an object within the fingertips of the hand and wiggle the fingers, or walk them along the object's surface. Dexterous manipulation, however, is just one of the many techniques available to the robot. The robot can also roll the object in the hand by using gravity, or adjust the object's pose by pressing it against a surface, or if fast enough, it can even toss the object in the air and catch it in a different pose. All these techniques have one thing in common: they rely on resources extrinsic to the hand, either gravity, external contacts or dynamic arm motions. We refer to them as \u201cextrinsic dexterity\u201d. In this paper we study extrinsic dexterity in the context of regrasp operations, for example when switching from a power to a precision grasp, and we demonstrate that even simple grippers are capable of ample in-hand manipulation. We develop twelve regrasp actions, all open-loop and hand-scripted, and evaluate their effectiveness with over 1200 trials of regrasps and sequences of regrasps, for three different objects (see video [2]). The long-term goal of this work is to develop a general repertoire of these behaviors, and to understand how such a repertoire might eventually constitute a general-purpose in-hand manipulation capability.",

Existing implementations, however, have relied on embedding optical fibers in small-diameter metal wires or needles. This paper proposes polymer tubes as an alternative substrate for the fibers. This approach separates the sensors from the robot structural components while using a minimal amount of the robot's tool lumen and providing the potential of inexpensive fabrication. Since the fibers are stiffer than the polymer substrate, however, design challenges arise in modeling strain transfer between the fibers and the tube substrate. To investigate the potential of this approach, a strain transfer model is derived and validated through simulation and experiment.",

Although a relative state space has been previously discounted, we show that such a state space is actually extremely powerful, able to achieve recognizable results after just one iteration. The power behind the technique (called POReSS) is the coupling between parameters that causes the orientation of one node to affect the position and orientation of other nodes. At the same time, the approach is fast because, like the more popular incremental state space, the Jacobian never needs to be explicitly computed. Furthermore, we show that while POReSS is able to quickly compute a solution near the global optimum, it is not precise enough to perform the fine adjustments necessary to reach the global minimum. As a result, we augment POReSS with a fast variant of Gauss-Seidel (called Graph-Seidel) on a global state space to allow the solution to settle closer to the global minimum. We show that this combination of POReSS and Graph-Seidel converges more quickly and scales to very large graphs better than other techniques while at the same time computing a competitive residual.",

The formulation is numerically stable, using a convex optimization that is guaranteed to converge to a unique optimum, and it is also scalable due to the use of a fast feasible set precomputation step that greatly reduces dimensionality of the optimization problem. The algorithm handles frictional contact constraints with arbitrary numbers of contact points as well as torque, acceleration, and velocity limits. Results are demonstrated in simulation on locomotion problems on the Hubo-II+ and ATLAS humanoid robots, demonstrating that the algorithm can optimize trajectories for robots with dozens of degrees of freedom and dozens of contact points in a few seconds.",

Our method represents a gripper model by using two mask images, one describing a contact region that should be filled by a target object for stable grasping, and the other describing a collision region that should not be filled by other objects to avoid collisions during grasping. The graspability measure is computed by convolving the mask images with binarized depth maps, which are thresholded differently in each region according to the minimum height of the 3D points in the region and the length of the gripper. Our method does not assume any 3-D model of objects, thus applicable to general objects. Our representation of the gripper model using the two mask images is also applicable to general grippers, such as multi-finger and vacuum grippers.

Different approaches can be used to generate these basic motion skills \u2014 motion primitives. To move in a complex environment, several motion primitives are needed and a mechanism to switch them is required. This can be realized using a high-level motion planning. To enable autonomous operation of modular robots equipped with limited computational resources, it is necessary to generate the motion plans on-board, i.e., without external computers. In this paper, we propose a novel simplified motion model of a modular robot, which allows the robot to employ the motion planner as a fast on-board replanner. The proposed approach has been verified both in simulations as well as with real robots.",

At the core of our approach lies a Random Ferns classifier, that models the posterior probabilities of different views of the target using multiple and independent Ferns, each containing features at particular positions of the target. A Shannon entropy measure is used to pick the most informative locations of these features. This minimizes the number of Ferns while maximizing its discriminative power, allowing thus, for robust detections at low computational costs. In addition, after offline initialization, the new incoming detections are used to update the posterior probabilities on the fly, and adapt to changing appearances that can occur due to the presence of shadows or occluding objects. All these virtues, make the proposed detector appropriate for UAV navigation. Besides the synthetic experiments that will demonstrate the theoretical benefits of our formulation, we will show applications for detecting landing areas in regions with highly repetitive patterns, and specific objects under the presence of cast shadows or sudden camera motions.",

We present a novel algorithm for reliably detecting multiple planes in real time in organized point clouds obtained from devices such as Kinect sensors. By uniformly dividing such a point cloud into non-overlapping groups of points in the image space, we first construct a graph whose node and edge represent a group of points and their neighborhood respectively. We then perform an agglomerative hierarchical clustering on this graph to systematically merge nodes belonging to the same plane until the plane fitting mean squared error exceeds a threshold. Finally we refine the extracted planes using pixel-wise region growing. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reliably detect all major planes in the scene at a frame rate of more than 35Hz for 640\u00d7480 point clouds, which to the best of our knowledge is much faster than state-of-the-art algorithms.",

As this method relies on local features, it permits the interoperability between cameras, allowing a camera to relocalise in a map built by a different camera. We also perform loop closing (detection + correction), at keyframerate, in loops containing hundreds of keyframes. For both relocalisation and loop closing, we propose a bag of words place recognizer with ORB features, which is able to recognize places spending less than 39 ms, including feature extraction, in databases containing 10K images (without geometrical verification). We evaluate the performance of this recognizer in four different datasets, achieving high recall and no false matches, and getting better results than the state-of-art in place recognition, being one order of magnitude faster.",

The motion of the system is abstracted to a class of uncertain Markov models known as bounded-parameter Markov decision processes (BMDPs). During the abstraction, an efficient sampling-based method for stochastic optimal control is used to construct several policies within a discrete region of the state space in order for the system to transit between neighboring regions. A BMDP is then used to find an optimal strategy over the local policies by maximizing a continuous reward function; a new policy can be computed quickly if the reward function changes. The efficacy of the framework is demonstrated using a sequence of online tasks, showing that highly desirable policies can be obtained by reconfiguring existing local policies in just a few seconds.",

The planner runs on top of monocular SLAM and uses the available information about structure of the environment and features visibility to find trajectories that maintain visual contact with feature-rich areas. The MAV continuously re-plans as it explores and updates the feature-points in the map. In real-world experiments we show that our system is able to avoid paths that lead into visually-poor sections of the environment by considering the distribution of visual features. If the same system ignores the availability of visually-informative regions in the planning, it is unable to estimate its state accurately and fails to reach its goal.",

        "abstract": "Many theoretic approaches for feedback stabilization control of nonholonomic mobile robots cannot be directly applied to practical robots since various kinematic constraints such as the velocity and acceleration limits are not considered in existing methods. To deal with this issue, we aim to propose a generic approach which first uses an (arbitrary) feedback stabilizer to generate the `path' and then rebuilt the corresponding `trajectory' along this `path' to meet various kinematic constraints, which ultimately gives a practical satisfactory solution for local trajectory planning. Specifically, a general framework is established to transform feedback stabilizers into a feasible and highly efficient trajectory planner by using path generation and optimal velocity planning techniques, considering both kinematic and differential constraints. Extensive simulation results are provided to validate the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "The use of redundant sensors brings a rich diversity of information, nevertheless fusing different sensors that run at vastly different frequencies into a proper estimate is still a challenging sensor fusion problem. Instead of using the size-varying measurements and thereby the size-varying filters during each sampling period, we propose to find a substitute of the unavailable low frequency measurements such that we can avoid using different sampling frequencies in one filter. In the gap between the sampling of two low frequency measurements, the use of these substitutes produces smoother estimates. In both the proof of concept simulation and the localization experiment performed on an indoor soccer robot, our proposed approach exhibits an improved performance compared to the size-varying Kalman filter methods.",

        "abstract": "A second order sliding mode controller is utilised to track reference trajectories for all the joints of a fully actuated biped robot. The existing tuning rules for the `twisting' controller are used to guarantee a priori attainment of a prescribed settling time between two successive impacts. The joint torque is modeled as the control input. Smoothing of the discontinuous controller is carried out by introducing a high gain linear controller inside a boundary layer defined by an arbitrarily small region around the origin thereby avoiding numerical errors in the simulations. The overall accuracy of motion control is dictated by the size of this layer leading to practical stability of the closed-loop system. The main contribution of the paper is to provide straightforward and realizable engineering guidelines for the reference trajectory generation and for the tuning of a robust finite time controller for achieving stable gait of a biped in the presence of disturbances in both continuous and impact phases. Numerical simulations of a biped robot are shown to support the theoretical results.",

All constant parameters of the robot system are estimated for an arbitrary target orbit. In order to achieve finite-gain L2 stability and ensure adaptive tracking performance, an output saturation function of the tracking error is introduced. The finite L2 gains are derived considering four actuator saturation cases, and finite-gain L2 stability is guaranteed locally based on passivity. The control performance is verified through numerical simulations using a two-link robot arm.",

The on-chip fabrication of movable 2D microstructures embedding fibroblasts (NIH/3T3) based on Poly (ethylene glycol) Diacrylate (PEGDA) was reported. Novel two-layered microfluidic devices were fabricated by Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), for conducting the fluidic self-assembly of the 2D microstructures. The self-assembly process was experimentally demonstrated. For improving the assembly results, a funneled structure and 3 micro grooves were added inside the microfluidic channel. Improved self-assembly result of constructing a multilayered tubular microstructure with higher efficiency was demonstrated.",

Assuming that a model of normal execution is given, the algorithm detects regions of space where data significantly deviate from normal. It achieves this by focusing optimization over a fixed-parameter family of shapes to find the one among them that is most likely anomalous, and then using this region to decide whether execution is anomalous. Experiments using synthetic and real robot data support the effectiveness of the approach.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Achieving efficient end-effector planning for manipulators in real world workspaces is challenging due to the fact that planning is performed in manipulator joint space, while the planning goal is given in end-effector or tool space. For manipulator planning, the problem becomes a joint path planning and inverse kinematics problem to be resolved efficiently, in spite of the potentially infinite number of inverse solutions to the end-effector goal state and the nonlinear relationship between joint configurations and world obstacles. The Forage-RRT algorithm described in this paper attempts to efficiently and quickly resolve the end-effector or tool planning problem. Using ideas from foraging theory, Forage-RRT implements a diffusion-based search strategy with two rates of diffusion, one high and one low, which simulate both long jumps (coarse search) and focused small area exploration (fine search) in the joint space, respectively. During coarse search, it is important to keep track of past fine searches, therefore the traditional RRT algorithm is augmented with a goal heap that keeps track of potential focused search regions and discards them when they result in failure. By mixing between two search distributions with different spreads, the search space is rapidly covered and potentially fruitful avenues are finely explored. The search coverage advantages of foraging identified in the biological research literature are demonstrated here for end-effector based, manipulator path planning.",

In impedance force tracking, the location of the environment relative to the robot and the stiffness of the environment should be known. The proposed method estimates the environment location and stiffness using only force and position measurements. The study is done for microscale taking into consideration microscale specificities, especially pull-off force. The impedance control formulation is tested experimentally in a contact transition scenario consisting of a compliant microforce sensor mounted on a microrobotic positioner, and three compliant microstructures with different stiffness. A traditional double mass-spring-damper model of the overall robot is employed to develop the closed-loop impedance control.",

This paper explores the concept of rapid deployment through the use of in-vivo sensory information to adapt a pre-operative surgical plan and to increase robustness against registration and misalignment errors during robot deployment. Robotic insertion of cochlear implant electrode arrays is presented as a benchmark application demonstrating this concept. Two key ideas are presented within the context of this application: First, a hybrid position and admittance controller is used to define an insertion path plan that is modified based on in-vivo force measurements in order to reduce sensitivity to misalignment errors. Secondly, a new concept allowing the use of force cues to determine the onset of advance-off stylet electrode array insertion is presented. The new controller is tested with electrode insertions in both plastic models and human cadaveric specimens. The experiments show that insertion forces may be maintained or reduced compared to preplanned trajectories relying solely on the initial registration.",

        "abstract": "The paper presents a control law for interaction tasks with environments of unknown geometrical and mechanical properties by manipulators mounted on compliant bases. Based on force-tracking impedance controls, the control strategy allows the execution of such class of tasks using the estimation of base position as a feedback in the control loop, requiring at the same time the on-line estimation of the environment stiffness. The properties of the control using non co-located sensors and the dynamic configuration of the coupled baserobot-environment system are studied. An Extended Kalman Filter is used for the estimation of the environment because of measurement uncertainties and errors in compound interaction model. The base is modelled as a second-order physical system with known parameters (offline identification before the task execution) and the base position is estimated from the measure of interaction forces. The grounding position estimation and the defined control law are validated in simulation and with experiments, especially dedicated to an insertion-assembly task. Control laws with and without the base compensation in the feedback loop are compared, verifying the effectiveness of the developed control law.",

        "abstract": "Possessing two manipulators heightens the ability of dual-arm robots (DAR) to conduct complex tasks, while raising hazard that the two manipulators might collide with each other or with other objects. DARs are usually equipped with a collision-free motion planning algorithms (CFMPA) to prevent the two manipulators from colliding. The CFMPA searches the motion paths of robot manipulators, which are expected to be as short and smooth as possible under the premise of ensuring safety. It is important to ensure that the algorithm is correct and efficient. It is not enough to apply traditional test methods to determine whether DARs can work in safety-critical applications. In this paper, theorem proving technology is employed to analyze the correctness and efficiency of a classical CFMPA. The CFMPA is outlined, and then formalized in high order logic with the theorem prover HOL4. An inconsistency in the range of motions of the robot manipulators in the algorithm is discovered. An improved algorithm is therefore proposed. Formal verification with HOL4 proves the correctness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm that has already run on a real DAR as well, in conformity with our expectation.",

A Hidden Markov Model is used to encode the spatio-temporal information of multiple demonstrations. In combination with Gaussian Mixture Regression for extracting the important task properties, feasible full-body motion adaption can be achieved. The method is suited for use with a humanoid robot by considering additional constraints like balance control and collision avoidance. In order to tackle modeling errors occurring due to the human movement demonstration and the robotic reproduction, a manipulability based weighting scheme is proposed. Complexity reduction of the otherwise redundant pose measure is performed based upon a mechanical analogy of an interconnected spring system. Experiments are conducted using a HRP-4 robot and display the applicability of the presented methods for robotic full-body motion imitation tasks.",

Oftentimes, rather than aiming to achieve low prediction error everywhere, one is interested in determining whether the phenomenon exhibits certain critical behavior. In this paper, we consider the problem of focusing autonomous sampling to determine whether and where the sensed spatial field exceeds a given threshold value. We introduce a receding horizon path planner, LSE-DP, which plans efficient paths for sensing in order to reduce our uncertainty specifically around the threshold value. We report fully autonomous field experiments with an Autonomous Surface Vessel (ASV) in an aquatic monitoring setting, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. LSE-DP is able to reduce the uncertainty around the threshold value of interest to 68% when compared to non-adaptive methods.",

Firstly, a gait period detector, which utilizes a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), is developed to estimate the user's current gait period among the six major periods. Then, an impedance based controller is used to apply assistive torques to the hip and knee joints of the user based on the functional task intended at the current gait period. To validate the above control scheme, preliminary experiments have been performed with one healthy subject walking on a treadmill. The results show that the gait period detector can effectively detect each gait period for the whole cycle. Based on measurements of the heart rate, the proposed assistance method has shown that it can effectively assist a human user in walking at speed of 1 km/h.",

        "abstract": "Most previous research has focused on classifying single human activities contained in segmented videos. However, in real-world scenarios, human activities are inherently continuous and gradual transitions always exist between temporally adjacent activities. In this paper, we propose a Fuzzy Segmentation and Recognition (FuzzySR) algorithm to explicitly model this gradual transition. Our goal is to simultaneously segment a given video into events and recognize the activity contained in each event. Specifically, our algorithm uniformly partitions the video into a sequence of non-overlapping blocks, each of which lasts a short period of time. Then, a multi-variable time series is creatively formed through concatenating the block-level human activity summaries that are computed using topic models over each block's local spatio-temporal features. By representing an event as a fuzzy set that has fuzzy boundaries to model gradual transitions, our algorithm is able to segment the video into a sequence of fuzzy events. By incorporating all block summaries contained in an event, the proposed algorithm determines the most appropriate activity category for each event. We evaluate our algorithm's performance using two real-world benchmark datasets that are widely used in the machine vision community. We also demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in important robotics applications, such as intelligent service robotics. For all used datasets, our algorithm achieves promising continuous human activity segmentation and recognition results.",

        "abstract": "Beating-heart surgery is not currently possible for most surgical procedures as it requires superhuman skill to manually track the heart's motion while performing a surgical task. However, if a surgical tool could track the motion of the point of interest (POI) on the heart, then, with respect to the surgical tool tip the POI would appear stationary. Such a system can be created with a teleoperated surgical robot that is controlled to track the combination of the heart's and the surgeon's motion, as input through a separate user console. To develop such a system, the motion of the heart is found in ultrasound images where the image acquisition introduces delays of approximately 40 ms and image processing further increases this delay. Directly using this delayed position measurement in the feedback control loop can lead to instability and poor tracking. The generalized predictive controller used in this work compensates for this time delay despite large disturbances with velocities up to 210 mm/s and accelerations up to 3800 mm/s2 caused by the moving heart.",

        "abstract": "Discontinuities in sensing domains are common when planning for many robotic navigation and manipulation tasks. For cameras and 3D sensors, discontinuities may be inherent in sensor field of view or may change over time due to occlusions that are created by moving obstructions and movements of the sensor. The associated gaps in sensor information due to missing measurements pose a challenge for belief space and related optimization-based planning methods since there is no gradient information when the system state is outside the sensing domain. We address this in a belief space context by considering the signed distance to the sensing region. We smooth out sensing discontinuities by assuming that measurements can be obtained outside the sensing region with noise levels depending on a sigmoid function of the signed distance. We sequentially improve the continuous approximation by increasing the sigmoid slope over an outer loop to find plans that cope with sensor discontinuities. We also incorporate the information contained in not obtaining a measurement about the state during execution by appropriately truncating the Gaussian belief state. We present results in simulation for tasks with uncertainty involving navigation of mobile robots and reaching tasks with planar robot arms. Experiments suggest that the approach can be used to cope with discontinuities in sensing domains by effectively re-planning during execution.",

However, so far they are restricted to Euclidean space: input data such as position and velocity need to be Euclidean. In this paper, we examine GPs over time series of 6D rigid body motions including large rotations. As the use of Euler angles with large rotations results in inaccurate predictions, we present an extension of the valid input data to quaternions H and dual quaternions HD. The quality of a GP prediction over unit quaternions is compared with GP prediction over Euler angles. The results are evaluated based on experimental data from a quadrotor and in a learning task of a collision free 6D motion trajectory incorporating large rotations based on artificial data from a motion planner.",

        "abstract": "Two ideas have gained traction in research in the robotics planning community. Activity planning has become popular where a library of predefined manipulation of the vehicle state is accessible, and is commonly used for missions with complex goal specifications. Another focus has been chance-constrained programming as a method of providing robust motion planning, in which the probability of failure is bounded. A combination of the two would allow for robust satisfaction of complex directives. However, to perform chance-constrained activity planning, we must be able to provide probabilistic bounds on the trajectory of the vehicle. While this may be done through propagation of statistics, we would require information about the actuation noise for the vehicle dynamics. In addition to such parameters as mean and variance, we also need to know the appropriate function for the noise. In many cases, the exact distribution of the actuation noise may not be known, although researchers can easily approximate the first two moments through calibrations. In this work we look at statistics propagation when only the first two moments of the actuation uncertainty is known, assuming white noise. We show that for linear systems, propagation is exact. Further, by looking at the expected error squared as a stochastic process, we can show that it is a submartingale under certain assumptions, and thus derive error bounds for deviation from mean over the duration of the entire path. We empirically show that, for nonlinear dynamics, we may approximate the propagation with the unscented transform, and obtain the corresponding bounds.",

To these robots, it is important to perform environmental cognition not only building environment map for autonomous motion of the robots but also estimating presences of human around the robots. In this study, by utilizing human state estimation function and SLAM based mapping technology, a concept and architecture of Human Motion Map by representing human behavior in the human living space as a hybrid map system are proposed. Beyond the conventional map which represents the existence of wall and objects, Human Motion Map represents not only the existence of humans in a particular location but also motion distributions. With recent improvements of the cloud computing technology, Human Motion Map can be accumulated as a kind of big data while measurements of robots are performed continuingly while it is moving around. In this paper, we propose a motion feature classification algorithm for clustering human motions geographically. Some experiment result of basic motion feature extraction, geographical clustering, and human motion behavior analyzing are provided for illustrating the validity of proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "For humanoid robots to perform whole-body motions, a motion planner should generate feasible motions satisfying various constraints including joint torque limitation, friction, balancing, collision, and so on. Furthermore, for life-size humanoid robots to perform higher-load motions, such as climbing ladders, safely, it is important to generate motions which requirements are not too close to the limitations. In this paper, we propose a humanoid motion planner based on Body Retention Load Vector (BRLV), which is a novel index for representing severity of physical constraints: limitation of joint Torque, contact Force, and contact Moment (TFM limitations). By minimizing the norm of BRLV, we obtain humanoid motions that are farthest from TFM limitations. Finally, we evaluate the proposed motion planner in simulation and confirm the effectiveness of the planner through experiments in which a life-size humanoid robot climbs a ladder and a car.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we proposed a control system with learning to investigate neuromechanical functions for generating adaptive bipedal locomotion on a splitbelt treadmill. Humans show two types of adaptations, called early adaptation and late adaptation, in splitbelt treadmill walking. In our previous work, we investigated the locomotor behavior of a biped robot driven by nonlinear oscillators with phase resetting and showed that it produced the early adaptation like humans. However, because the locomotion control system did not contain any learning mechanism, it did not show the late adaptation. In this paper, we newly develop learning systems, which modulate the interlimb and intralimb coordination patterns, and incorporate them to our locomotion control system. We investigated the locomotor behavior of a biped robot using computer simulations and robot experiments. The results showed the early and late adaptations during the splitbelt treadmill walking and the time evolution of locomotion parameters was similar to that of humans, which might contribute to understanding of adaptive mechanism in humans and to guiding principle for designing a control system of biped robots.",

        "abstract": "The standing-up motion is one of the most important activities of daily livings. In order to understand the strategy to achieve the standing-up motion, muscle synergy analysis is applied to the measured data during human standing-up motion. In addition, musculoskeletal model which consists of three body segments and nine muscles in lower limb is developed to ensure that the standing-up motion can be generated by muscle synergies. As a result, three muscle synergies have been extracted from the human standing-up motion, and each synergy strongly corresponded to characteristic kinematic events: momentum flexion, momentum transfer, and posture stabilization. Results of forward dynamic simulation show that the standing-up motion can be achieved by controlling time-varying weighting coefficient of three muscle synergies instead of controlling individual nine muscles.",

        "abstract": "We introduce a novel computational method for geometric rearrangement of multiple movable objects on a cluttered surface, where objects can change locations more than once by pick and/or push actions. This method consists of four stages: (i) finding tentative collision-free final configurations for all objects (all the new objects together with all other objects in the clutter) while also trying to minimize the number of object relocations, (ii) gridization of the continuous plane for a discrete placement of the initial configurations and the tentative final configurations of objects on the cluttered surface, (iii) finding a sequence of feasible pick and push actions to achieve the final discrete placement for the objects in the clutter from their initial discrete place, while simultaneously minimizing the number of object relocations, and (iv) finding feasible final configurations for all objects according to the optimal task plan calculated in stage (iii). For (i) and (iv), we introduce algorithms that utilize local search with random restarts; for (ii), we introduce a mathematical modeling of the discretization problem and use the state-of-the-art ASP reasoners to solve it; for (iii) we introduce a formal hybrid reasoning framework that allows embedding of geometric reasoning in task planning, and use the expressive formalisms and reasoners of ASP. We illustrate the usefulness of our integrated AI approach with several scenarios that cannot be solved by the existing approaches. We also provide a dynamic simulation for one of the scenarios, as supplementary material.",

        "abstract": "Direct volume rendering (DVR) is commonly employed for the medical visualization. Multi-dimensional transfer functions are used in DVR to emphasize the region of interest in details. However, it is impractical to interact directly with the functions in more than three dimension. This paper proposes a novel framework called geometry constrained sparse embedding (GCSE) for dimensionality reduction (DR). GCSE allows the conventional DR methods to be applied to a dictionary with much smaller atoms instead. The mapping derived from the dictionary feeds to the original features to obtain the ones in the reduced dimension. To obtain a good dictionary, the intrinsic structure of features is encoded in the sparse embedding based on a geometry distance. In addition, stochastic gradient descent algorithm is employed to speed up the dictionary learning. Various experiments have been conducted using both synthetic and real CT data sets. Compared with conventional methods, GCSE not only produces the comparable results, but also performs well with the capability to handle the large data set more powerfully. The rendering results using the real CT data has demonstrated the effectiveness of GCSE.",

The inversion is based on linear accelerations of angular motion sensed by a triaxial MEMS accelerometer, which is attached to the tip of the telescopic extension.

From this model, we estimate the normalcy of the trajectory given by a new agent in the domain, and provide behavioural advice based on an approximation of the trade-off in utility between potential benefits to the exploring agent and the costs incurred in giving this advice. This model is evaluated on a maze world domain by providing advice to different types of agents, and we show that this leads to a considerable and unanimous improvement in the completion rate of their tasks.",

        "abstract": "In order to investigate under the sea, various types of underwater robots have been developed. However, most robots can only perform one type of moving such as screw, water gliding or walking, even though there are some creatures which use various types of locomotion in the wild life. Thus, we propose a new type of underwater robot, the \u201cGlide Walker\u201d, which can change its way of locomotion between gliding, walking and swimming depending on the situation. It can be performed by using its two wings with 3 DOFs each and its tail with 1 DOF. This article presents the basic concept, the moving strategy and the mechanical design of the robot in details. Moreover, it also presents the developed prototype, as well as the conducted experiments in which the robot was able to perform the three ways of locomotion successfully. Additionally, it also shows the high manipulation capability and the loop maneuver performance of the robot when in the swimming mode.",

In our approach, objects are parametrized using smooth differentiable functions which are obtained from point cloud data via a spectral analysis. We show how, starting with point cloud data of various objects, one can utilize this space consisting of grasps and smooth surfaces in order to continuously deform various surface/grasp configurations with the goal of synthesizing force closed grasps on novel objects. We illustrate the resulting shape space for a collection of real world objects using multidimensional scaling and show that our formulation naturally enables us to use gradient ascent approaches to optimize and simultaneously deform a grasp from a known object towards a novel object.",

Our crane robot has a configuration that provides three translational d.o.f., and a camera was added to its end-effector. In order to compute the translational velocity sent to the robot controller, the area and center of gravity in the image of the object to be grasped are used. Experimental results are presented.

These corrupt the representation due to violating the underlying static-world assumptions of common grid mapping algorithms and are therefore detected and filtered from the map. For this purpose, a subsequent step is suggested that identifies, clusters and merges dynamic cell hypothesis in a novel way. Thereafter, an Interacting-Multiple-Model-Unscented-Kalman-Probabilistic-Data-Association (IMM-UK-PDA) tracker is used to classify of whether cell movements behave consistently with possible movement characteristics of real dynamic objects or are just generated by noise or newly observed static environment. In opposition to many other approaches, the method explicitly combines information of newly occupied and free areas, completes the shape of only partly visible dynamic objects and uses an advanced object tracking scheme to clean the grid from dynamic object corruptions. The method is evaluated with grids generated by an automotive radar and stereo camera in real traffic environments.",

They are often done separately using occupancy grids and established object tracking algorithms. In this work, an approach is presented that estimates a uniform, low-level, grid-based world model including dynamic and static objects, their uncertainties, as well as their velocities. It does not require existing object tracks to filter out data points not used for creating and updating the map. Nor does it require that measurements can be classified into belonging to a static or to a moving object. Promising results from experiments with an autonomous vehicle equipped with a laser scanner demonstrate the usefulness of the approach.",

We make use of ROS local navigation planner to find an obstacle-free path by modeling the human as a non-holonomic robot. Linear and angular velocities to keep the \u2018robot\u2019 on the path are dynamically calculated, which are then converted to vibrations and applied by the tactile belt. We define directional and rotational vibration patterns and evaluate which ones are suitable for guiding humans. Continuous patterns for representing directions had the least average angular error with 8.4\u00b0, whereas rotational patterns were recognized with near-perfect accuracy. All patterns had a reaction time slightly more than 1 seconds. The person is tracked in laser scans by fitting an ellipse to the torso. Average tracking error is found to be 5cm in position and 14\u00b0 in orientation in our experiments with 23 people. Best tracking results was achieved when the person is 2.5m away and is facing the sensor or the opposite way. The human control system as a whole is successfully demonstrated in a navigation guidance scenario.",

        "abstract": "Particles such as thrombi, bullet fragments, and shrapnel can become trapped in a person's heart after migrating through the venous system, or by direct penetration. These cardiac foreign bodies pose a serious health risk as they can interfere with cardiovascular function. Conventional treatment often requires open heart surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass, and a long incision of the heart muscle, which come with significant risk and recovery time. To circumvent these disadvantages, we propose a minimally invasive surgical approach using 3D ultrasound to guide a dexterous robotic capture device. Analysis of the foreign body trajectory indicates highly erratic motion, rendering a robotic retrieval strategy based on direct pursuit of the tracked target infeasible. To provide a relatively slow robot with the ability to retrieve such a target, we propose alternative strategies based on guiding a robot to a salient capture location, and ambushing the target upon its reappearance. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of 3D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in tracking a foreign body in a beating heart phantom, computing a suitable capture location, and guiding a high dexterity robot to secure the target.",

        "abstract": "The need to relate measurements made by a camera to a different known coordinate system arises in many engineering applications. Historically, it appeared for the first time in the connection with cameras mounted on robotic systems. This problem is commonly known as hand-eye calibration. In this paper, we present several formulations of hand-eye calibration that lead to multivariate polynomial optimization problems. We show that the method of convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) relaxations can be used to effectively solve these problems and to obtain globally optimal solutions. Further, we show that the same approach can be used for the simultaneous hand-eye and robot-world calibration. Finally, we validate the proposed solutions using both synthetic and real datasets.",

The device uses a customized force sensor that measures grasping forces over a range of 0-300mN and uses an actuator to exert amplified forces back on to the operator's fingertip in a mechanically-ungrounded setup. This allows perception of low force levels that are otherwise imperceptible to human touch. A customized force sensor design for the forceps grasping measurement is presented and a calibration experiment was conducted to validate its linearity and repeatability. A bench test of the device was conducted to demonstrate its intrinsic force-amplifying capabilities, with amplification factors of up to \u00d750 reported. A user study was conducted to confirm that the device could significantly improve human perception of grasping forces compared to conventional microsurgical forceps with the results demonstrating an order-of-magnitude improvement in force perception.",

The one-vs-all approach that optimizes the boundary between positive samples from a target class and negative samples from the others has been the most standard approach for object detection. However, because this approach trains each object detector independently, the scores are not balanced between object classes. The proposed method combines ideas derived from both detection and classification in order to balance the scores across all object classes. We optimized the boundary between target classes and their \u201chard negative\u201d samples, just as in detection, while simultaneously balancing the detector scores across object classes, as done in multi-class classification. We evaluated the performances on multi-class object detection using a subset of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2011 dataset and showed our method outperformed a de facto standard method.",

To overcome the stack actuator's limitations, particularly their limited stroke, a harmonic poly-actuator design is presented. This design utilizes a multitude of intermediate buckling amplification mechanisms in a parallel arrangement to create a large stroke, high force actuator. The redundant system architecture combined with a particular spatial and temporal coordination allow for a number of salient features, including robustness to failure, backdrivability, and continuous force control via elementary ON-OFF control. A prototype was built using six intermediate buckling amplification mechanisms and was able to produce over 100 Newtons of force over a stroke of 450 mm.",

In general GPS solutions can be two or more orders cheaper than their inertial sensors counterparts. This paper addresses the north alignment by gyrocompassing in the context of more modern smoothing techniques. Incremental smoothing is becoming a serious contender for in-situ state estimation. The work here presents a probabilistic model for north alignment with an analysis towards the achievable accuracy of such a system. A pose graph formulation is used to estimate inertial sensor calibration terms over a long spanning trajectory, from which a true north alignment can be extracted. The preintegral method is used to condense high rate inertial data, but allow for post integration bias correction. Results show that the proposed alignment scheme is feasible, and would for gyrocompassing alignment relaxed sensor performance constraints.",

In this paper, we explain two key geodetic mapping methods that we believe are relevant for robotics. We also aim at providing a geodetic perspective on current state-of-the-art SLAM methods and at identifying similarities between the solutions proposed by both communities.

        "abstract": "For an effective intelligent active mobility assistance robot, the walking pattern of a patient or an elderly person has to be analyzed precisely. A well-known fact is that the walking patterns are gaits, that is, cyclic patterns with several consecutive phases. These cyclic motions can be modeled using the consecutive gait phases. In this paper, we present a completely non-invasive framework for analyzing a normal human walking gait pattern. Our framework utilizes a laser range finder sensor to collect the data, a combination of filters to preprocess these data, and an appropriately synthesized Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for state estimation, and recognition of the gait data. We demonstrate the applicability of this setup using real data, collected from an ensemble of different persons. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that the proposed human data analysis scheme has the potential to provide the necessary methodological (modeling, inference, and learning) framework for a cognitive behavior-based robot control system. More specifically, the proposed framework has the potential to be used for the recognition of abnormal gait patterns and the subsequent classification of specific walking pathologies, which is needed for the development of a context-aware robot mobility assistant.",

        "track": "main",

        "abstract": "We propose a hierarchical planning framework for mission planning and execution in uncertain and dynamic environments. We consider missions that involve motion planning in large, cluttered environments, trading off mission objectives while satisfying logical/spatial/temporal constraints. Our framework enables the decomposition of the planning problem across different layers, leveraging the difference in spatial and temporal scales of the mission objectives. We show that this framework facilitates contingency management under unanticipated events. Interaction between the various layers requires consistent model abstractions and common message semantics. To satisfy these requirements, we adopt a generic knowledge-based architecture that is independent from a specific application domain. We show a specific instance of our framework using a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) planner at the higher level and a Multi-Objective Probabilistic Roadmap (MO-PRM) planner at the lower level. The resulting planning system is tested in a realistic scenario where an agent is tasked with a mission in a large urban threat rich environment under dynamic uncertain conditions. The mission specification includes a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula that defines the desired behaviors, a list of metrics to be optimized and a list of constraints on time, resources and probability of mission success.",

The disturbance force is modeled as a discrete conditional probability distribution that is updated online by local measurements as the vehicle navigates. A global planner identifies the optimal route to the goal and adapts this route according to a cost metric derived from the belief distribution on the disturbance force. A local planner embeds the belief distribution in the trajectory generation process to compute dynamically feasible trajectories along the global plan that evolve with the belief. Simulation studies analyze and demonstrate the increased trajectory tracking accuracy via the proposed methodology with a single vehicle and the impact of the approach to multiple agents performing collaborative inference toward enhanced collective performance.",

As a limited resource, bandwidth is ubiquitously required by applications among physical multi-robot systems. In this paper, we proposed a hierarchical auction-based mechanism, namely LQM (Link Quality Matrix)-auction. It consists of multiple procedures, such as hierarchical auction, proxy scheduling. Note that the proposed method is designed for real-time resource retrieval for physical multi-robot systems, instead of simulated virtual agents. We validate the proposed mechanism through real-time experiments. The results show that LQM-auction is suitable for scheduling a group of robots, leading to optimized performance for resource retrieval.",

Compared to previous approaches, the hierarchy enables our method to represent the environment with differently sized surface patches. The reconstruction scheme starts at a coarse resolution with large patches and in an iterative fashion uses the reconstruction error to guide the decision as to whether the resolution should be refined. This leads to variable resolution models that represent areas with few variations at low resolution and areas with large variations at high resolution. In addition, we compactly describe local surface attributes via sparse coding based on an overcomplete dictionary. In this way, we additionally exploit similarities in structure and texture, which leads to compact models. We learn the dictionary directly from the input data and independently for every level in the hierarchy in an unsupervised fashion. Practical experiments with large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method compares favorably with two state-of-the-art techniques while being comparable in accuracy.",

In the low-level layer, each area includes a set of fixed routes, along which the AGVs have to move. An algorithm is also introduced for the automatic definition of the route map itself. The coordination among the AGVs is obtained exploiting shared resources (i.e. centralized information) and local negotiation (i.e. decentralized coordination).

We utilize heterogeneous features, such as points, line segments, lines, planes, and vanishing points, and their inner geometric constraints as the integrated high level landmarks. This is managed through a multilayer feature graph (MFG). Our method extends local bundle adjustment (LBA)-based framework by explicitly exploiting different features and their geometric relationships in an unsupervised manner. The algorithm takes a video stream as input, initializes and incrementally updates MFG based on extracted key frames; it also refines localization and MFG landmarks through the LBA. Physical experiments show that our method can reduce the absolute trajectory error of a traditional point landmark-based LBA method by up to 63.9%.",

The key characteristic of the proposed method is that it performs online self-calibration of the camera and the IMU, using detailed models for both sensors and for their relative configuration. Specifically, the estimated parameters include the camera intrinsics (focal length, principal point, and lens distortion), the readout time of the rolling-shutter sensor, the IMU's biases, scale factors, axis misalignment, and g-sensitivity, the spatial configuration between the camera and IMU, as well as the time offset between the timestamps of the camera and IMU. An additional contribution of this work is a novel method for processing the measurements of the rolling-shutter camera, which employs an approximate representation of the estimation errors, instead of the state itself. We demonstrate, in both simulation tests and real-world experiments, that the proposed approach is able to accurately calibrate all the considered parameters in real time, and leads to significantly improved estimation precision compared to existing approaches.",

We focus on the scenario in which a fast-moving car attempts to navigate from a start location to a set of goal coordinates in minimum time with no prior information about the environment, building a map in real time from onboard sensor data. Whereas existing planners for exploration confine themselves to a conservative set of constraints to guarantee safety around unknown regions of the environment, we instead learn a hazard function from data, which maps the vehicle's dynamic state and current environment knowledge to a probability of collision. We perform receding horizon planning in which the objective function is evaluated in expectation over those learned probabilities of collision. Our algorithm demonstrates sensible emergent behaviors, like swinging wide around blind corners, slowing down near the map frontier, and accelerating in regions of high visibility. Our algorithm is capable of navigating from start to goal much more quickly than the conservative baseline planner without sacrificing safety. We demonstrate our algorithm on a 1:8-scale high-performance RC car equipped with a planar laser range-finder and inertial measurement unit, reaching speeds of 4m/s in unknown, indoor spaces.

        "abstract": "We propose a method by which a micro air vehicle (MAV) can hover without propulsion power. In this paper, we describe the design of a magnetic adhesion mechanism and a winch mechanism for an MAV that is used to perform search operations inside buildings. An MAV equipped with these mechanisms can adhere to an iron ceiling and search for a long time from an appropriate position. We designed a magnetic adhesion mechanism with an adhesion force of over 20 N. The magnetic adhesion mechanism comprises a magnet, dual coil springs, and a switching mechanism. Using models of MAV and the adhesion mechanism, we determined the parameters of the mechanism. The magnetic adhesion mechanism can be detached easily by a force less than the magnetic adhesion force. The winch mechanism comprises a structure to retriev the adhesion mechanism, a strong, lightweight tether and a servo-motor that produces enough torque to lift the MAV by the tether. We confirmed that the MAV can hover without propulsion power by using these mechanisms.",

Therefore, there is a need for UAV path planning algorithms that minimize the likelihood of invading human privacy. We formulate the problem of human-aware path planning as a nonstationary Markov Decision Process, and provide a novel model-based reinforcement learning solution that leverages Gaussian process clustering. Our algorithm is flexible enough to accommodate changes in human population densities by employing Bayesian nonparametrics, and is real-time computable. The approach is validated experimentally on a large-scale long duration experiment with both simulated and real UAVs.",

Assume we can detect human pose and label each part of human body, we use the RANSAC algorithm to estimate the frontal and sagittal planes and refine it by calculating the minimum moment of inertia of point cloud.

Many laboratory-based studies have described various gait detection systems with different wearable inertial sensors, but only limited number of papers addressed the issues by using some non-wearable sensors. A practical method of gait information detection and gait analysis is proposed in the paper using an inexpensive Microsoft Kinect fixed on the midpoint of lower extremity rehabilitation robot. The horizontal distances between Kinect plane and every mark pasted on lower extremity are acquired. Taken the characteristics of gait distance series into consideration, the Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model is established to reflect the changing rule of gait status. Combined with the Kalman filter, gait information reflecting rehabilitation status at next moment is predicted accurately. The method regarding the gait detection and gait analysis is verified by amounts of gait experiments finally.",

In this paper, semi-Markov process (SMP) is applied to model and analyze human gait in level walking. Gait states are detected from ground reaction forces (GRFs), and gait cycles are described as state transitions in a gait Markov chain (GMC) with sojourn times. Several gait features are defined and online estimated based on the SMP model. With this model, abnormal gait patterns are further analyzed and indexes for gait abnormality assessment are proposed. Experiments of gait analyses with proposed method are conducted on subjects with different health conditions. Results show that individual gait pattern can be successfully obtained and evaluated.

For these applications, it is important to consider the stability and coordination of human-robot interaction. While various control techniques have been developed for human-robot interaction, existing methods do not take the advantages of human ability in responding and adapting to unknown environment. In this paper, a human-guided manipulation problem which is able to take advantages of both the human knowledge and the robot's ability, is formulated and solved. The workspace is divided into a human region, where human play a more active role in the manipulation task, and a robot region, where the robot is more dominant in the manipulation. The proposed formulation allows the involvement of human control action to deal with unforeseen changes or uncertainty in the real world. We present a theoretical foundation that allows the stability and coordination of the human-guided manipulation problem to be analyzed. Based on the human region and the robot region, an adaptive tracking controller is developed. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed control method.",

To realize the bipedal walking, first a PD controller is utilized to track the optimized trajectory. Next, impedance control parameters are estimated from the experimental data. Finally, the unified PD, impedance torque control law is experimentally realized on the bipedal robot AMBER2.

We also explored using computer vision techniques and navigation techniques on the robot nodes to conduct active human target detection. The robot nodes, therefore, are able to detect human faces while exploring the unknown environment, and then relay the face images to the operator for target recognition.

        "abstract": "The challenge of aerial robotic physical interaction towards inspection of infrastructure facilities through contact is the main motivation of this paper. A hybrid model predictive control framework is proposed, based on which a typical quadrotor vehicle becomes capable of stable physical interaction, accurate trajectory tracking on environmental surfaces as well as force control with only minor structural adaptations. Convex optimization techniques enabled the explicit computation of such a controller which accounts for the dynamics in free-flight and during physical interaction, ensures the stability of the hybrid system as well as response optimality, while respecting system constraints and imposed logical rules. This control framework is further extended to include obstacle avoidance capabilities. Extensive experimental studies that included complex \u201caerial-writing\u201d tasks, interaction with non-planar and textured surfaces and obstacle avoidance maneuvers, indicate the efficiency of the approach and the potential capabilities of such aerial robotic physically interacting operations.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a hybrid vision-based SLAM and moving objects tracking (vSLAMMOT) approach. This approach tightly combines two key methods: a superpixel-based segmentation to detect moving objects and a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter to estimate a stereo-vision-based SLAM posterior. Most successful methods perform vision-based SLAM (vSLAM) and track moving objects independently. However, we pose both vSLAM and moving object tracking as a single correlated problem to leverage the performance. Our approach estimates the relative camera motion using the previous tracking result, and then detects moving objects from the estimated camera motion recursively. Moving superpixels are detected by a Markov Random Field (MRF) model which uses spatial and temporal information of the moving objects. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach for vSLAMMOT using both synthetic and real datasets and compare the performance with other methods.",

To avoid the drawbacks of computationally-expensive outlier-removal steps based on random-sample schemes, we use a single-degree-of-freedom kinematic model of the vehicle to initialize an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm that is utilized to select high-quality inliers. The motion is then computed incrementally from the inliers using a standard linear 3D-to-2D pose-estimation method without any additional batch optimization. The performance of the approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic data and publicly-available datasets (e.g., KITTI and Devon Island) collected over several kilometers in both urban environments and challenging off-road terrains. Experiments show that the our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy, runtime, and ease of implementation.",

By carefully examining the linear dependence between calibration Jacobian columns, it is proved that joint offsets and Adjoint errors cannot be identified simultaneously, and the maximum dimension of identifiable parameters is 4r + 2t + 6. Some more scenarios are considered to augment the Adjoint error approach. To satisfy the constraints on joint relations, constrained method and projection method are proposed. Moreover, we present the identifiability of reduction ratios and joint pitches. Simulations of a 6 Degree-of-Freedom robot and a SCARA robot are given to illustrate and compare our methods. It shows that the constrained method can handle such situations effectively and yields better results.",

A Markov random field is employed to model the joint probability of point labels, which can take on a number of user-defined surface classes. The probability of a point depends on both local spatial features of the point cloud around the point as well as the classifications of points in its neighborhood. The training step estimates joint and pairwise potentials from labeled point cloud datasets, and the prediction step aims to maximize the joint probability of all labels using a hill-climbing procedure. The method is applied to stair and ladder detection from noisy and partial scans using three types of sensors: a sweeping laser sensor, time-offlight depth camera, and a Kinect depth camera. The resulting classifier achieves approximately 75% accuracy and is robust to variations in point density.",

The control software interface of this robot provides numerical values of the link inertia matrix and the gravity vector at each configuration, together with link position and joint torque sensor data. Taking advantage of this information, a general procedure is set up for determining the structure and identifying the value of the relevant dynamic coefficients used by the manufacturer in the evaluation of these robot model terms. We call this a reverse engineering approach, because our main goal is to match the numerical data provided by the software interface, using a suitable symbolic model of the robot dynamics and the inertial and gravity coefficients that are being estimated. Only configuration-dependent terms are involved in this process, and thus static experiments are sufficient for this task. The main issues of dynamic model identification for robots with elastic joints are discussed in general, highlighting the pros and cons of the approach taken for this class of KUKA lightweight manipulators. The main identification results, including training and validation tests, are reported together with additional dynamic validation experiments that use the complete identified model and joint torque sensor data.",

        "abstract": "Endurance is a critical problem that most flying robots will definitely encounter. Inspired by flying animals in nature that take frequent short flights with periods of perching in between, we propose an innovative mechanism with flying and adhesion to solve this problem. Previously, we have developed some prototypes of flying and adhesion robots. However, when the robots switch between flying and adhesion, it is difficult to control the contact force; moreover, the robots could be damaged because of the abnormal contact with the environment. Therefore, we propose an impedance control approach for bio-inspired flying and adhesion robots to have smooth contact with the environment. The dynamic model of a bio-inspired robot is described, and the proposed impedance control method is applied to regulate the contact force with the environment. The bio-inspired flying and adhesion robot performs several phases of desired missions in the sequential manner. Firstly, the robot performs position control to approach the desired perch position. Secondly, the robot contacts with the environment and regulate the contact force. Both simulation and experiments were performed to validate the proposed method. The results verified the feasibility of the proposed control methods in controlling a bio-inspired flying and adhesion robot.",

        "abstract": "Object handover is a basic task in many human-robot interactive scenarios and therefore, it is important for assistive robots to be able to perform proper handovers. We previously designed a human-inspired grip-force-varying handover controller for a robot giver and showed on a Willow Garage PR2 robot that the controller yields human-like and human-preferred handovers. The PR2 robot had a non-compliant fully-actuated gripper. However, recently, compliant underactuated grippers have been gaining more popularity. Although compliant underactuated grippers can provide more flexibility in manipulation, it is generally difficult to accurately measure and control the amount of applied grip force. In this paper, we present an implementation of the human-inspired handover controller on a Kawada Industries HRP4R robot, which has compliant underactuated hands, using joint position error measurement for estimating the amount of applied grip force. Through an experiment, we show that we are able to achieve safe, smooth, and intuitive robot-human handovers despite the lack of accurate grip force control on our robot.",

In this paper we introduce a methodology to solve a tracking problem, that is defining a decentralized control strategy for making a networked system follow an arbitrarily defined periodic setpoint function. The most suitable interconnection topology is defined together with the control law as the solution of a constrained optimization problem, in order to ensure asymptotic tracking.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "As it is well known, robots are complex devices capable of performing very fast and precise movements. Developing robots and their controllers is a very challenge task due to the different technologies that are needed to be dealt with (access to peripherals, real-time operating systems, communications \u2026) and the amounts of programming work that is needed. Moreover, this work needs to be repeated in most cases when a new robot is developed. A new way is needed for developing the code implemented for controlling these robots that allows to reuse it in a safe way. In this paper, the Orocos (Open Robot Control Software) middleware has been chosen for the controller development. Orocos is a real-time middleware, focused on control systems, especially those related to robotics and automation. Its greatest advantage over the other solutions available is the capability to provide an off-the-shelf hard real-time operation. This is essential in most of the robotics applications, making this middleware in a very suitable piece of software. Since Orocos is a component-based middleware, several CBSD (component-based software development) techniques have been used to design and implement the control system. Thus, using a modular control structure, a number of advantages can be achieved such as code reusability, execution of the modules in a distributed way, ability to load or instantiate a module several times, easy following of flow execution and fewer programming errors. In addition, these components are configurable and reconfigurable in runtime. In fact, in a typical control application, there are three parts that can be thought as software components that are reading sensors, computing the control action, and sending it to the actuators. Besides this, in some applications it is also possible to find common parts to different control strategies that can be implemented as separate software components that are loaded, instantiated and configured depending on the control strateg...

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a real-time motion and force capturing system for tele-operated robotic manipulation that combines surface-electromyogram (sEMG) pattern recognition with an inertia measurement unit(IMU) for motion calculation. The purpose of this system is to deliver the human motion and intended force to a remote robotic manipulator and to realize multi-fingered activities-of-daily-living (ADL) tasks that require motion and force commands simultaneously and instantaneously. The proposed system combines two different sensors: (i) the IMU captures arm motion, (ii) and the sEMG detects the hand motion and force. We propose an algorithm to calculate the human arm motion using IMU sensors and a pattern recognition algorithm for a multi-grasp myoelectric control method that uses sEMG signals to determine the hand postures and grasping force information. In order to validate the proposed motion and force capturing system, we used the in-house developed robotic arm, K-Arm, which has seven degrees-of-freedom (three for shoulder, one for elbow, and three for wrist), and a sixteen degrees-of-freedom robotic hand. Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)-based network communication was implemented for total system integration. The experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed method, although some open problems encountered.",

        "abstract": "Active constraints are high-level control algorithms providing software-generated force feedback from virtual environments. When applied to surgery, they can assist surgeons in performing complex tasks by guiding their navigation pathways along narrow, possibly convoluted, surgical trajectories. This paper presents a method to generate concave tubular constraints implicitly from pre- or intra-operative data. Patient-specific constraints may be generated efficiently with the proposed scheme and readily deployed in various surgical scenarios. Furthermore, a five degree-of-freedom active constraint framework is proposed, which accounts for the entire tool shaft rather than just the end-effector, and is applicable to both static and dynamic active constraint scenarios. Experimental results on simulated surgical tasks show that this framework can improve safety and accuracy as well as reduce the perceived workload during complex surgical tasks.",

Sensors, however, may fail during deployment, thereby jeopardizing the mission. This work proposes a solution, based on an adaptive dynamic model, to accurately predict the navigation of the AUV. A hydrodynamic model, derived from simple laws of physics, is integrated with a powerful non-parametric regression method. The incremental regression method, namely the Locally Weighted Projection Regression (LWPR), is used to compensate for un-modeled dynamics, as well as for possible changes in the operating conditions of the vehicle. The augmented hydrodynamic model is used within an Extended Kalman Filter, to provide optimal estimations of the AUV's position and orientation. Experimental results demonstrate an overall improvement in the prediction of the vehicle's acceleration and velocity.",

        "abstract": "One intuitive approach for planning robotic manipulation tasks is to first compute a plan for the manipulated object, as if capable to move on its own, then use the obtained plan to find a sequence of arm maneuvers to take the object along the computed plan. Motion planning queries would be performed in relatively low-dimensional configuration spaces, rather than the full configuration space of a robot's arms and grippers, resulting in a more efficient planning method. However, having a plan for the manipulated object does not guarantee there also exists a feasible sequence of maneuvers for the robot to do the manipulation. Knowing different possible grasps on the object increases the robots chance to find a sequence of grasp switches and maneuvers, but makes the search more time consuming as the grasps need to be tested for usefulness. In this paper, we develop a multi-level architecture for complex manipulation planning of rigid bodies which uses communication between the two levels, one for planning the manipulated object motion, the other to plan for the arms, to improve the efficiency of the method. We store grasp zones in the configuration space of the manipulated object as regions where a given grasp seems promising. We use grasp zones to guide searching for grasp switching maneuvers, and to avoid regions of configuration space where few good grasps exist.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce the concept of tunable visual features for moments based visual servoing schemes. The main contribution of this work is the introduction of tunable shift points along with some effective methods to tune them. We propose two different metrics: the first metric ensures optimal response of the control to errors in the image space and the second metric ensures orthogonality between the interaction matrix components (vectors) related to the control of x and y rotational motions. With the proposed method, it is possible to design moment invariants-based visual features whose interaction matrix is always non-singular for any desired pose (parallel or non-parallel). Thus, this work makes a significant contribution to the difficult problem of controlling the rotational motions around the x and y axes, when all the 6dof are involved. Two case studies are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed ideas. Results from each case are then used to design a moment invariants-based visual feature. This visual feature is used for visual servoing with a symmetrical object using binary moments and a free-form planar target using photometric moments.",

        "abstract": "When the motion of the human body is studied by means of marker-based motion capture systems, one of the main source of error in this analysis is caused by the markers movements with respect to the underlying bones due to skin motion and deformation. In the kinematics estimation of the lower limbs this error is particularly notable for the rotations in the frontal and axial planes. Many algorithms exist trying to compensate this problem, most of them giving satisfactory results in the estimation of the knee flexion/extension, but correcting the effects of the skin deformation in other rotations is still an open issue. We have implemented a new algorithm to compensate this problem. This method was evaluated on a motion of the human lower limbs and compared with another existing global approach. The results of this experiment showed that the proposed algorithm gives much better results in the analysis of human motion, particularly for the internal/external rotation of the knee.",

Due to the growing demand from high-mix manufacturing industry, it is difficult for the traditional robot to grasp a large number of assembly parts or tools having cylinder shapes with correct postures. In this research, a novel jaw like gripper with human-sized anthropomorphic features is designed for in-hand precise positioning and twisting online. It retains the simplicity feature of traditional industrial grippers and dexterity features of dexterous grippers. It can apply a constant gripping force on assembly parts and performs reliable twisting movement within limited time to meet the industrial requirements. Manipulating several cylindrical assembly parts by robot, as an experimental case in this paper, is studied to evaluate its performance. The effectiveness of proposed gripper design and mechanical analysis is proved by the simulation and experimental results.",

In this work, we propose the Enhanced Analytic Forward Model (EAFM), an integrated model of the AFM and the Heteroscedastic Gaussian Processes (HGP). The EAFM can compensate the shortfalls of the AFM by training the HGP on the residual of the AFM. This also allows the HGP to learn the repeatability of the micromanipulation system. Based on the EAFM, we further contribute an optimal position controller for improving the accuracy and the repeatability. This optimal EAFM controller is implemented and tested on a three degree-of-freedom micromanipulator based micromanipulation system. Two sets of real-world experiments are carried out to verify our method. The results demonstrate that the controller using EAFM can statistically achieve higher accuracy and repeatability than solely using the AFM.",

The proposed CC-RRT*-D employs the chance-constraint approximation and leverages the asymptotically optimal property of RRT* framework to compute risk-aware and asymptotically optimal trajectories. By explicitly considering the state dependence for prior state estimate, the over-conservative problem of chance-constraint approximation can be provably solved. Computational experiment results show that CC-RRT*-D is efficient and robust compared with related algorithms. The real-time experiment on an autonomous vehicle shows that our proposed algorithm is applicable to real-time obstacle avoidance.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an online place discovery and recognition engine that fuses information over time to create topologically distinct places. A key motivation is the recognition that a single image may be a poor exemplar of what constitutes a place. Images are not `places' nor are they `documents'. Instead, by treating image-sequences as a multimodal distribution over topics - and by discovering topics incrementally and online - it is possible to both reduce the memory footprint of place recognition systems, and to improve precision and recall. Distinctive key-places are represented by a cluster topics found from the covisibility graph of a relative simultaneous localization and mapping engine - key-places inherently span many images. A dynamic vocabulary of visual words and density based clustering is used to continually estimate a set of visual topics, changes in which drive the place-recognition process. The system is evaluated using an indoor robot sequence, a standard outdoor robot sequence and a long-term sequence from a static camera. Experiments demonstrate qualitatively distinct themes associated with discovered places - from common place types such as `hallway', or `desk-area', to temporal concepts such as `dusk', `dawn' or `mid-day'. Compared to traditional image-based place-recognition, this reduces the information that must be stored without reducing place-recognition performance.",

These techniques strongly capture the complicated effects of robot dynamics, which are often neglected in hand-crafted dynamic models. However, unlike robust performance shown in trained tasks, learned models do not exhibit a reliable performance in new tasks as they are valid only near the domain of the trained tasks. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach for task-to-task transfer learning, called \u201cIndependent Joint Learning (IJL).\u201d IJL learns the model for each joint independently rather than the whole body at one time to effectively transfer knowledge between tasks. A comparative simulation study on a 6 DOF PUMA robot demonstrates that our approach outperforms other related approaches when a task different from trained tasks is proposed.",

For this purpose, we use a variety of data sources which shed light on the current situation in Asia, Europe and North-America. First, we will examine the technology-readiness level (TRL) scale which can be used as a means of measuring market readiness of innovative technology. After this we will look at what means experts find useful for technology transfer. Finally, we investigate academia-industry collaboration as one tool to increase technology transfer. We demonstrate a strong collaboration between industry and academia in North America which we see as a response to the lower numbers of robots deployed in the industry in North America compared to Asia and Europe. This is an on-going trend which occurs in parallel to a global trend in growing numbers of robots in use.",

        "abstract": "The ability to reason over partially observable networks of interacting states is a fundamental competency in probabilistic robotics. While the well-known factor graph and Gaussian process models provide flexible and computationally efficient solutions for this inference problem in the special cases in which all of the hidden states are either finite-dimensional parameters or real-valued functions, respectively, in many cases we are interested in reasoning about heterogeneous networks whose hidden states are comprised of both finite-dimensional parameters and functions. To that end, in this paper we propose a novel probabilistic generative model that incorporates both factor graphs and Gaussian processes to model these heterogeneous systems. Our model improves upon prior approaches to inference within these networks by removing the assumption of any specific set of conditional independences amongst the modeled states, thereby significantly expanding the class of systems that can be represented. Furthermore, we show that inference within this model can always be performed by means of a two-stage procedure involving inference within a factor graph followed by inference over a Gaussian process; by exploiting fast inference methods for the individual factor graph and Gaussian process models to solve each of these subproblems in succession, we thus obtain a general framework for computationally efficient inference over heterogeneous finite-/infinite-dimensional systems.",

        "abstract": "Learning from demonstrations is an intuitive way for instructing robots by non-experts. One challenge in learning from demonstrations is to infer what to imitate, especially when the robot only observes the teacher and does not have further knowledge about the demonstrated actions. In this paper, we present a novel approach to the problem of inferring what to imitate to successfully reproduce a manipulation action based on a small number of demonstrations. Our method employs techniques from recommender systems to include expert knowledge. It models the demonstrated actions probabilistically and formulates the problem of inferring what to imitate via model selection. We select an appropriate model for the action each time the robot has to reproduce it given a new starting condition. We evaluate our approach using data acquired with a PR2 robot and demonstrate that our method achieves high success rates in different scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Utilizing the capabilities of configurable sensing systems requires addressing difficult information gathering problems. Near-optimal approaches exist for sensing systems without internal states. However, when it comes to optimizing the trajectories of mobile sensors the solutions are often greedy and rarely provide performance guarantees. Notably, under linear Gaussian assumptions, the problem becomes deterministic and can be solved off-line. Approaches based on submodularity have been applied by ignoring the sensor dynamics and greedily selecting informative locations in the environment. This paper presents a non-greedy algorithm with suboptimality guarantees, which relies on concavity instead of submodularity and takes the sensor dynamics into account. Coupled with linearization and model predictive control, the algorithm can be used to generate adaptive policies for mobile sensors with non-linear sensing models. Applications in gas concentration mapping and target tracking are presented.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose strategies for merging occupancy probabilities of target existence in multi-UAV cooperative search. The objective is to determine the impact of cooperation and type of information exchange on search time and detection errors. To this end, we assume that small-scale UAVs (e.g., quadrotors) with communication range limitations move in a given search region following pre-defined paths to locate a single stationary target. Local occupancy grids are used to represent target existence, to update its belief with local observations and to merge information from other UAVs. Our merging strategies perform Bayes updates of the occupancy probabilities while considering realistic limitations in sensing, communication and UAV movement - all of which are important for small-scale UAVs. Our simulation results show that information merging achieves a reduction in mission time from 27% to 70% as the number of UAVs grows from 2 to 5.",

        "abstract": "The online recalibration of multi-sensor systems is a fundamental problem that must be solved before complex automated systems are deployed in situations such as automated driving. In such situations, accurate knowledge of calibration parameters is critical for the safe operation of automated systems. However, most existing calibration methods for multisensor systems are computationally expensive, use installations of known fiducial patterns, and require expert supervision. We propose an alternative approach called infrastructure-based calibration that is efficient, requires no modification of the infrastructure, and is completely unsupervised. In a survey phase, a computationally expensive simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method is used to build a highly accurate map of a calibration area. Once the map is built, many other vehicles are able to use it for calibration as if it were a known fiducial pattern. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method to calibrate the extrinsic parameters of a multi-camera system. The method does not assume that the cameras have an overlapping field of view and it does not require an initial guess. As the camera rig moves through the previously mapped area, we match features between each set of synchronized camera images and the map. Subsequently, we find the camera poses and inlier 2D-3D correspondences. From the camera poses, we obtain an initial estimate of the camera extrinsics and rig poses, and optimize these extrinsics and rig poses via non-linear refinement. The calibration code is publicly available as a standalone C++ package.",

The compliant mechanism is shaped after the insect's flight thorax, which has integrated elastic hinges for energy storage. It shows a nonlinearly increasing stiffness, which slows the wings down rapidly toward the end of a wing stroke and reverses the wings quickly, just like the elastic radial stop in Dipteran insects. When used to drive a 10-cm wing span FWMAV, it saves power up to 31% in comparison to a conventional rigid-body flapping mechanism, which have no elastic storage capability.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a method to improve a robot's imitation performance in a drawing scenario by inserting pauses in motion. Human's drawing skills are said to develop through five stages: 1) Scribbling, 2) Fortuitous Realism, 3) Failed Realism, 4) Intellectual Realism, and 5) Visual Realism. We focus on stages 1) and 3) for creating our system, each corresponding to body babbling and imitation learning, respectively. For stage 1), the robot randomly moves its arm to associate robot's arm dynamics with the drawing result. Presuming that the robot has no knowledge about its own dynamics, the robot learns its body dynamics in this stage. For stage 3), we consider a scenario where a robot would imitate a human's drawing motion. Upon creating the system, we focus on the motionese phenomenon, which is one of the key factors for discussing acquisition of a skill through a human parent-child interaction. In motionese, the parent would first show each action elaborately to the child, when teaching a skill. As the child starts to improve, the parent's actions would be simplified. Likewise in our scenario, the human would first insert pauses during the drawing motions where the direction of drawing changes (i.e. corners). As the robot's imitation learning of drawing converges, the human would change to drawing without pauses. The experimental results show that insertion of pause in drawing imitation scenarios greatly improves the robot's drawing performance.",

Based on the distribution of their radial velocities across the azimuth angle, non-stationary targets and clutter are excluded. The ego-motion and its corresponding covariance matrix are estimated. The algorithm does not require any preprocessing steps such as clustering or clutter suppression and does not contain any model assumptions. The sensors can be mounted at any position on the vehicle. A common field of view is not required, avoiding target association in space. As an additional benefit, all targets are instantly labeled as stationary or non-stationary.",

A powerful integrated exploration solution must take into account decisions that improve the quality of the map construction, such as closing loops, at the same time that the environment is explored. Potential fields and boundary value problems (BVP) have been used with success in tasks of planning, localization and exploration, but not yet in integrated strategies. In this paper, we present an integrated exploration strategy using a time varying BVP-based exploration. Our strategy consists of creating potential rails that guide the robot to regions that are either unexplored or were visited a long time ago. We also apply local distortions in the potential field to generate a loop closure strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves the quality of the map construction, keeping the balance between revisiting and exploratory activities.",

        "abstract": "In the past few years the need for more flexibility in industrial production has implied a growing attention towards scenarios where humans work directly in touch with robots. In order to allow safe human-robot interaction, a methodology to evaluate the severity of an impact between a human worker and an industrial robot, based on related work on injury knowledge in human-robot contacts and relying on information coming from different exteroceptive sensors, has been developed in this paper. On the basis of this severity evaluation, the robot controller enforces a suitable safety-oriented strategy, ranging from on-path speed reduction to task-consistent evasive motion and protective stop. The safety evaluation methodology has been implemented in a dedicated software component, integrated with a video surveillance system and with the real time robot controller to obtain a complete HW/SW architecture named \u201cSafety Controller\u201d. The system has been validated on an ABB IRB140 robot.",

        "abstract": "The trajectories of mobile seeds have a great influence on localization accuracy and efficiency. This paper presents a novel information-driven intelligent mobility-assisted wireless sensor network localization algorithm. Without requiring any prior knowledge of the sensing field, seeds' or pseudo-seeds' (common sensors which have been positioned) trajectories are scheduled dynamically aiming at position estimates of neighboring non-positioned common sensors. With an information-theoretic utility measure as the objective function, mobile seeds or pseudo-seeds actively determine their motion directions for minimizing the uncertainty in position estimates of neighboring sensors. At the first level, seeds estimate the neighboring sensor nodes' positions with bearing measurements by means of extended Kalman filters and optimize their motion directions by maximizing the mutual information between the position estimates and the motions of seeds. Afterwards the seeds forward the position estimates to the corresponding sensor nodes, which then act as pseudo-seeds. By repeating this process at the following levels, all sensor nodes can obtain position estimates. Compared with heuristic mobility and random mobility-assisted mobile sensor network localization algorithms, the proposed algorithm requires fewer maneuvers of seed or pseudo-seeds for quick convergence to good position estimates. Extensive simulations show that this algorithm can provide more accurate position estimates with fewer maneuvers, especially in the case of limited seeds.",

        "abstract": "To engage in cooperative activities with human partners, robots have to possess basic interactive abilities and skills. However, programming such interactive skills is a challenging task, as each interaction partner can have different timing or an alternative way of executing movements. In this paper, we propose to learn interaction skills by observing how two humans engage in a similar task. To this end, we introduce a new representation called Interaction Primitives. Interaction primitives build on the framework of dynamic motor primitives (DMPs) by maintaining a distribution over the parameters of the DMP. With this distribution, we can learn the inherent correlations of cooperative activities which allow us to infer the behavior of the partner and to participate in the cooperation. We will provide algorithms for synchronizing and adapting the behavior of humans and robots during joint physical activities.",

We present a decision-theoretic formulation of this problem, using Bayesian filtering techniques to maintain a distributional estimate of the mechanism type and parameters. In order to reduce the amount of interaction required to arrive at a confident identification, we select actions explicitly to reduce entropy in the current estimate. We demonstrate the approach on a domain with four primitive and two composite mechanisms. The results show that this approach can correctly identify complex mechanisms including mechanisms which are difficult to model analytically. The results also show that entropy-based action selection can significantly decrease the number of actions required to gather the same information.",

Operating these devices is challenging due to their complex, unintuitive kinematics and the need to avoid sensitive structures in the anatomy. In this paper, we present a motion planning method that computes collision-free motion plans for concentric tube robots at interactive rates. Our method's high speed enables a user to continuously and freely move the robot's tip while the motion planner ensures that the robot's shaft does not collide with any anatomical obstacles. Our approach uses a highly accurate mechanical model of tube interactions, which is important since small movements of the tip position may require large changes in the shape of the device's shaft. Our motion planner achieves its high speed and accuracy by combining offline precomputation of a collision-free roadmap with online position control. We demonstrate our interactive planner in a simulated neurosurgical scenario where a user guides the robot's tip through the environment while the robot automatically avoids collisions with the anatomical obstacles.",

        "abstract": "Internal impedance is one of the key factors determining the quality of embodied perception and action in biological organisms and robots. Though the role of impedance control in robotic actuation has been well studied, its significance in the accuracy of proprioception with embodied sensors is not well known yet. Therefore, it is important to characterize the relationship between the entropy of sensor information and the impedance of their physical embodiment, through which sensors feel the internal state of the body and the environment. In this paper, we address the role of internal impedance in the accuracy of embodied perception. To investigate this, we pose the problem of using only torque data measured at the stationary base of a two link planar manipulator, to estimate the deflection caused by an external torque in the McKibben type pivot joint with variable stiffness. Based on analytical modelling and experimental validation, this paper presents, for the first time, that non-linear static memory primitives relating internal impedance, internal kinematic variables, and forces felt at the base of the manipulator \u2014 similar to the functionality of tendon organs of biological counterparts \u2014 can be used to tune optimal internal impedance parameters to maximize the accuracy of internal state estimation during external perturbations.",

        "abstract": "We present a methodology for enabling service robots to interpret spatial language instruction sequences expressed through natural language discourse from non-expert users. As part of our approach, we propose a novel probabilistic algorithm for the automatic extraction of contextually and semantically valid instruction sequences from unconstrained spatial language discourse. Additionally, we present the design and implementation details of a procedure for reference resolution of anaphoric expressions encountered within the user discourse. Towards application of our human-robot interaction (HRI) methodology on robot platforms in practice with end users, we discuss a generalized procedure for transfer to physical systems and provide solutions for key pragmatic considerations including the generation of safe robot execution paths for both the robot and people in the environment. The paper concludes with an evaluation of our spatial language-based HRI framework implemented on a PR2 robot to demonstrate the generalizability and usefulness of our approach in real world applications.",

        "abstract": "Developmental robots require cognitive structures that can learn perception-action cycles via interactions with the environment. Here, we extend the efficient coding hypothesis, which has been used to model the development of sensory processing in isolation, to model the development of the perception-action cycle. Our extension combines sparse coding and reinforcement learning so that sensory processing and behavior co-develop to optimize a shared intrinsic motivational signal: the fidelity of the neural encoding of the sensory input under resource constraints. Applying this framework to a model of a robot actively observing a time-varying environment leads to the simultaneous development of visual smooth pursuit behavior and model neurons similar to cortical neurons selective to visual motion. We suggest that this general principle may form the basis for a unified and integrated approach to learning many other perception/action loops.",

In this paper, we present a new formulation of this problem for the case where the dynamic system is differentially flat. We show that a solution is easy to obtain in this case, in fact reducing to finite-dimensional linear least-squares minimization. We also show how to make this solution robust to model perturbation, sampled data, and measurement noise, as well as provide a recursive implementation for online learning. Finally, we apply our new formulation of inverse optimal control to model human locomotion during stair ascent. Given sparse observations of human walkers, our model predicts joint angle trajectories for novel stair heights that compare well to motion capture data (R2 = 0.97, RMSE = 1.95 degrees). These exemplar trajectories are the basis for an automated method of tuning controller parameters for lower-limb prosthetic devices that extends to locomotion modes other than level ground walking.",

Our focus is to accurately distinguish between actions that are related in that the object's state changes define the essential differences. Our algorithm uses a latent variable conditional random field that allows for the modelling of spatio-temporal relationships between the human motion and the corresponding object state changes. Our approach involves a factored representation that better allows for the description of causal effects in the way human action causes object state changes. The utility of incorporating such structure in our model is that it enables more accurate classification of activities that could enable robots to reason about interaction, and to learn using a high level vocabulary that captures phenomena of interest. We present experiments involving the recognition of human actions, where we show that our factored representation achieves superior performance in comparison to alternate flat representations.",

        "abstract": "Automatic recognition of human actions in video has been a highly addressed problem in robotics and computer vision. Majority of the recent work in literature has focused on classifying pre-segmented video clips, and some progress has also been made on joint detection and recognition of actions in complex video sequences. These methods, however, are not designed for wireless camera networks where the sensors have limited internal processing and communication capabilities. In this paper we present an efficient system for the joint detection and recognition of human actions using a network of wireless smart cameras. The foundation of our work is based on Deformable Part Models (DPMs) for detecting objects in static images. We have extended this framework to the single-view and multi-view video setting to jointly detect and recognize actions. We call this the Deformable Keyframe Model (DKM) and tightly integrate it within a centralized video analysis system. In our system, feature extraction is locally performed on-board wireless smart cameras, and the classification is performed at a base station with higher processing power. Our analysis demonstrates that this decoupling of the the recognition pipeline can significantly minimize the power and bandwidth consumed by the wireless cameras. We experimentally validate our DKMs on two data sets. We first demonstrate the competitiveness of our algorithm by comparing its performance against other state-of-the-art methods, on a publicly available dataset. Then, we extensively validate our system on a novel dataset called the Bosch Multiview Complex Action (BMCA) dataset. Our dataset consists of 11 actions continuously performed by 20 different subjects while being captured by cameras located at 4 different vantage points. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the presence of multiple-views improves the performance of action detection and recognition by about 15% over the single-view setting. Show More",

This is achieved by a constraint that defines a one-dimensional submanifold and a bang-bang control which generates a limit cycle on this submanifold. The approach is based on classical impedance control with the difference that the stiffness on the submanifold and the force to preserve a predefined nominal body configuration result from the intrinsic mechanical springs in the joints. Furthermore, we propose two controller implementations: the first implementation does not require to detect the contact state, while the second implementation requires contact state detection, but accounts in addition for Coulomb friction constraints. The controller is validated in simulation with a compliantly actuated quadruped.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel kinematic control scheme based on the Virtual Incision Ports (VIPs) for redundancy resolution of redundant robotic arms for single-port access (SPA) surgery. In general, manipulators have 6 DoFs except grippers to be able to reach the desired pose in 3D space. If a surgical robot for SPA surgery has only 6 DoFs, then its workspace could be restricted severely. Therefore most robots including our developed robot consist of more than 6 DoFs with an elbow to maintain triangulation. This means they have a redundancy resolution problem. One of the most popular methods for a redundancy resolution is a pseudo-inverse Jacobian method [1]. In case of robotic SPA surgery, however, this method intrinsically has a high possibility for hurting abdominal organs and muscles or conflicting with other instruments because of the unexpected elbow movements. Our control scheme can decrease the possibility of a collision with them and provide a more flexible working area for surgical tasks by reallocating the VIP. Results presented from simulation and experiment will demonstrate them.",

To solve the challenge problems of kinematics of the soft inflatable arm, new approaches are proposed, including redundant rigid arm and soft inflatable joint models. The approaches have a good advantage of applying to muti-joint arms. As our knowledge it is the first time to solve the kinematics of muti-joint soft inflatable arm in Three-Dimensional coordinate space.

        "abstract": "This paper provides kinematic analysis and local motion planning methods for multi-limbed robots. In particular, we consider combined stance and reach tasks for robotic mechanisms whose limbs can be used either as legs or manipulator arms. An example of such a system is the RoboSimian robot participating in the DARPA Robotics Challenge (Figure 1). We develop relationships which model the key quasi-statics and kinematics of these mechanisms: the stance map, the stance Jacobian, and the reach Jacobian, as well as the stance constrained center-of-mass Jacobian. We also introduce characterizations of multi-limbed mechanism configurations in terms of the properties of these maps: local dexterity and limberness. This paper also introduces local planning methods which seek to balance the motion of legs, body, and arms of such mechanisms so as to realize manipulation goals while also maintaining awareness of stance stability issues. Examples with a simple planar model illustrate the methods.",

        "abstract": "Robot-centered cells play a more and more important role in the fields of incorporate automation and repetitive processing in order to increase productivity and to improve quality. In practice, it is always desired to achieve maximum/near-maximum throughput in a robotic cell. Sometimes, even a small improvement in throughput will be one of the highlighted objectives in robot scheduling, for instance, in the 3C industry of communication, computer and consumer electronics. In this paper, the scheduling problem in an n-workstation (n<;=8) m-stage robotic cell with parallel workstations is discussed by considering the constraints in real engineering practice, including free/non-free pick-up, allowed time window, and free/non-free process. A new method is proposed for optimal scheduling by means of optimally arranging each blocked cycles in every LCM cycle (Least Common Multiple), and assembling them in a proper order. This method is applied to a practical scheduling problem for a 7-workstation robotic cell. It is shown that the throughput is dramatically enhanced after optimization in the engineering scenario. Moreover, by comparing the resultant increase in revenue with the additional equipment costs, the result diagrams also provide managerial insights into links between throughput and cell layout flexibility.",

We show how actions and their effects on objects, together with perceptual representations of the objects, are used to build generative models which then can be used in internal simulation to predict the outcome of actions. Specifically, the paper presents an experiential cycle for learning association between object properties (softness and height) and action parameters for the wiping task and building generative models from sensorimotor experience resulting from wiping experiments. Object and action are linked to the observed effect to generate training data for learning a non-parametric continuous model using Support Vector Regression. In subsequent iterations, this model is grounded and used to make predictions on the expected effects for novel objects which can be used to constrain the parameter exploration. The cycle and skills have been implemented on the humanoid platform ARMAR-IIIb. Experiments with set of wiping objects differing in softness and height demonstrate efficient learning and adaptation behavior of action of wiping.",

Our method learns to reason about spatial relations of objects and fuses low-level class predictions to a consistent interpretation of a scene. Our model incorporates color, depth and 3D scene features, on which an energy function is learned to directly optimize object class prediction using the loss-based maximum-margin principle of structural support vector machines. We evaluate our approach on the NYU V2 dataset of indoor scenes, a challenging dataset covering a wide variety of scene layouts and object classes. We hard-code much less information about the scene layout into our model then previous approaches, and instead learn object relations directly from the data. We find that our conditional random field approach improves upon previous work, setting a new state-of-the-art for the dataset.",

        "abstract": "Generalising dexterous grasps to novel objects is an open problem. We show how to learn grasps for high DoF hands that generalise to novel objects, given as little as one demonstrated grasp. During grasp learning two types of probability density are learned that model the demonstrated grasp. The first density type (the contact model) models the relationship of an individual finger part to local surface features at its contact point. The second density type (the hand configuration model) models the whole hand configuration during the approach to grasp. When presented with a new object, many candidate grasps are generated, and a kinematically feasible grasp is selected that maximises the product of these densities. We demonstrate 31 successful grasps on novel objects (an 86% success rate), transferred from 16 training grasps. The method enables: transfer of dexterous grasps within object categories; across object categories; to and from objects where there is no complete model of the object available; and using two different dexterous hands.",

        "abstract": "Myoelectric controlled interfaces are a vital component for advancing applications in prostheses, exoskeletons, and robot teleoperation. Current methods search for optimal neural decoders for enhanced initial user performance. However, recent studies demonstrate learning an inverse model of abstract decoders to improve performance over time. This paper proposes a paradigm shift on myoelectric interfaces by embedding the human as controller of a system and allowing the human to learn how to control it via control tasks with similar mapping functions. The method is tested using two different control tasks and four different abstract mappings of upper limb myoelectric signals to control actions for those tasks. The results confirm that all subjects are able to learn the mappings and improve performance efficiency over time. A cross-trial evaluation reveals a significant learning transfer when a new control task is presented using the same mapping as a previous task, resulting in enhanced initial performance with the new task. Comparison of EMG signal evolution across subjects indicates a significant population-wide muscle synergy development that results from learning and implementing the inverse model of the mapping function to complete the tasks. This suggests that efficient performance may be achieved by learning a constant, arbitrary mapping function applied to multiple control tasks rather than dynamic subject- or task-specific functions. Moreover, this method can be used for the neural control of any device or robot, without restricting them to anthropomorphic or human-related counterparts.",

In the task-parameterized Gaussian mixture model framework, the movements are considered to be modulated with respect to a set of candidate frames of reference (coordinate systems) attached to a set of objects in the robot workspace. Following a similar approach, this paper addresses the problem of having missing candidate frames during the demonstrations and reproductions, which can happen in various situations such as visual occlusion, sensor unavailability, or tasks with a variable number of descriptive features. We study this problem with a dust sweeping task in which the robot requires to consider a variable amount of dust areas to clean for each reproduction trial.",

Unlike the approaches that require conditional independence assumptions, our model is very flexible in encoding the full connectivity among observations, latent states, and activity states. The model is able to capture richer class of contextual information in both state-state and observation-state pairs. Although loops are present in the model, we can consider the graphical model as a linear-chain structure, where the exact inference is tractable. Thereby the model is very efficient in both inference and learning. The parameters of the graphical model are learned with the Structured-Support Vector Machine (Structured-SVM). A data-driven approach is used to initialize the latent variables, thereby no hand labeling for the latent states is required. Experimental results on the CAD-120 benchmark dataset show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art approach by over 5% in both precision and recall, while our model is more efficient in computation.",

        "abstract": "Object-level impedance control is of great importance for object-centric tasks, such as robust grasping and dexterous manipulation. Despite the recent progress on this topic, how to specify the desired object impedance for a given task remains an open issue. In this paper, we decompose the object's impedance into two complementary components-the impedance for stable grasping and impedance for object manipulation. Then, we present a method to learn the desired object's manipulation impedance (stiffness) using data obtained from human demonstration. The approach is validated in two tasks, for robust grasping of a wine glass and for inserting a bulb, using the 16 degrees of freedom Allegro Hand mounted with the SynTouch tactile sensors.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning motor skills based on grossness and fineness of movements involved in daily-life tasks. Grossness and fineness depend on the degrees of complexity (i.e., linear combinations between basis vectors) and repeatability (i.e., repeat accuracies between multiple trials) of such movements. In such a daily-life task, a robot's movements are usually related to a task-relevant object. Therefore, the complexity and the repeatability should be acquired from datasets that include the spatial and temporal relationships between a robot and a task-relevant object. To measure the degree of complexity, correlations are first obtained from each data by canonical correlation analysis. To measure the degree of repeatability, variations are then obtained from covariances between datasets acquired by multiple trials. The grossness and fineness are finally acquired by combining the correlations and the variations. To learn a motor skill, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is estimated using well-known methods as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), k-means, Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms. First, initial parameters of a GMM are estimated by weighting a conventional k-means algorithm with the grossness and fineness. Based on PCA, BIC, and EM algorithms, the GMM is then estimated using the initial parameters and a robot's motion trajectories. To validate our proposed methods, the GMM is evaluated in terms of reproduction and recognition using a robot arm that performs two daily-life tasks: cookie-decorating and constrained-delivering tasks.",

        "abstract": "We demonstrate a sample-efficient method for constructing reusable parameterized skills that can solve families of related motor tasks. Our method uses learned policies to analyze the policy space topology and learn a set of regression models which, given a novel task, appropriately parameterizes an underlying low-level controller. By identifying the disjoint charts that compose the policy manifold, the method can separately model the qualitatively different sub-skills required for solving distinct classes of tasks. Such sub-skills are useful because they can be treated as new discrete, specialized actions by higher-level planning processes. We also propose a method for reusing seemingly unsuccessful policies as additional, valid training samples for synthesizing the skill, thus accelerating learning. We evaluate our method on a humanoid iCub robot tasked with learning to accurately throw plastic balls at parameterized target locations.",

While the problem of learning manipulator models from visual and proprioceptive data has been addressed before, existing techniques often rely on assumptions about the structure of the robot or tracked features in observation space. We make no such assumptions. Instead, we formulate the problem as that of learning a high-dimensional controlled stochastic process. We leverage recent work on nonparametric predictive state representations to learn a generative model of the depth camera and robotic arm from sequences of uninterpreted actions and observations. We perform several experiments in which we demonstrate that our learned model can accurately predict future depth camera observations in response to sequences of motor commands.",

The proposed method allowed the robot not only to learn categories describing individual objects, but also to learn categories describing pairs and groups of objects with high recognition accuracy. Furthermore, by grounding the category representations in its own sensorimotor repertoire, the robot was able to estimate how similar two categories are in terms of the behaviors and sensory modalities that are used to recognize them. Finally, this grounded measure of similarity enabled the robot to boost its recognition performance when learning a new category by relating it to a set of familiar categories.",

Probabilistic frameworks, however, have barely been used in this context. This paper presents a general approach for generating probabilistic maps from heterogeneous sensor data. The key idea is to learn the spatial correlation of a sensor through Gaussian Process models and use it as priors for Bayesian fusion. This approach is applied to the novel application of pipe thickness mapping. Data from a 3D laser scanner on the outer surface of the pipe and thickness measurements from a contact ultrasonic sensor are fused into a single thickness map with associated uncertainty. Moreover, a dedicated algorithm to model the ultrasonic sensor using kernel density estimation is also proposed. The overall approach is evaluated using the full 3D profile (outer and inner surfaces) of the pipe section as ground truth.",

We are particularly interested in possibilities for actions afforded by relationships among pairs of objects. For example if an object is \u201cinside\u201d another or \u201con top\u201d of another. For this there is a need for a vision system which can recognise such relationships in a scene. We use an approach in which a vision system first segments an image, and then considers a pair of objects to determine their physical relationship. The system extracts surface patches for each object in the segmented image, and then compiles various histograms from looking at relationships between the surface patches of one object and those of the other object. From these histograms a classifier is trained to recognise the relationship between a pair of objects. Our results identify the most promising ways to construct histograms in order to permit classification of physical relationships with high accuracy. This work is important for manipulator robots who may be presented with novel scenes and must identify the salient physical relationships in order to plan manipulation activities.",

        "abstract": "We describe a semantic mapping algorithm that learns human-centric environment models by interpreting natural language utterances. Underlying the approach is a coupled metric, topological, and semantic representation of the environment that enables the method to fuse information from natural language descriptions with low-level metric and appearance data. We extend earlier work with a novel formulation that incorporates spatial layout into a topological representation of the environment. We also describe a factor graph formulation of the semantic properties that encodes human-centric concepts such as type and colloquial name for each mapped region. The algorithm infers these properties by combining the user's natural language descriptions with image- and laser-based scene classification. We also propose a mechanism to more effectively ground natural language descriptions of distant regions using semantic cues from other modalities. We describe how the algorithm employs this learned semantic information to propose valid topological hypotheses, leading to more accurate topological and metric maps. We demonstrate that integrating language with other sensor data increases the accuracy of the achieved spatial-semantic representation of the environment.",

In this paper, we present an algorithm that learns how to provide good route descriptions from a corpus of human-written directions. Using inverse reinforcement learning, our algorithm learns how to select the information for the description depending on the context of the route segment. The algorithm then uses the learned policy to generate directions that imitate the style of the descriptions provided by humans, thus taking into account personal as well as cultural preferences and special requirements of the particular user group providing the learning demonstrations. We evaluate our approach in a user study and show that the directions generated by our policy sound similar to human-given directions and substantially more natural than directions provided by commercial web services.",

People naturally use attributes and names to refer to objects of interest. Due to the complexity of indoor environments and the fact that people use various ways to refer to objects, a robot frequently encounters new objects or object names. To deal with such situations, a robot must be able to continuously grow its object knowledge base. In this work we introduce a system that organizes objects and names in a semantic hierarchy. Similarity between name words is learned via a hierarchy embedded vector representation. The hierarchy enables reasoning about unknown objects and names. Novel objects are inserted automatically into the knowledge base, where the exact location in the hierarchy is determined by asking a user questions. The questions are informed by the current hierarchy and the appearance of the object. Experiments demonstrate that the learned representation captures the meaning of names and is helpful for object identification with new names.",

Such obstacles affect the airflow around the MAV and can thereby affect its flight characteristics. We describe a system for predicting these effects at a distance, using depth images obtained from an RGB-D sensor. Predictions are based on learning from prior experience gathered during training flights. We show that aerodynamic effects caused by obstacles are consistent, and demonstrate that it is practical to make predictions from experience without running a computationally expensive aerodynamic simulation. Our approach uses a Gaussian process regression, it requires minimal parameter tuning and is able to predict the acceleration that will be expected at a distance in the future. The method produces estimates within 12ms without any code optimisation and the results indicate good prediction ability with mean errors within 4\u201310cm/s2 on a database of various obstacles.",

A switch of the phase can result in the robot's actions suddenly influencing different aspects of its environment. Therefore, the boundaries between phases often correspond to constraints or subgoals of the manipulation task. In this paper, we investigate how the phases of manipulation tasks can be learned from data. The task is modeled as an autoregressive hidden Markov model, wherein the hidden phase transitions depend on the observed states. The model is learned from data using the expectation-maximization algorithm. We demonstrate the proposed method on both a pushing task and a pepper mill turning task. The proposed approach was compared to a standard autoregressive hidden Markov model. The experiments show that the learned models can accurately predict the transitions in phases during the manipulation tasks.",

In this paper, we present an approach to learn the composite navigation behavior of interacting agents from demonstrations. The decision process that ultimately leads to the observed continuous trajectories of the agents often also comprises discrete decisions, which partition the space of composite trajectories into homotopy classes. Therefore, our method uses a mixture probability distribution that consists of a discrete distribution over the homotopy classes and continuous distributions over the composite trajectories for each homotopy class. Our approach learns the model parameters of this distribution that match, in expectation, the observed behavior in terms of user-defined features. To compute the feature expectations over the high-dimensional continuous distributions, we use Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. We exploit that the distributions are highly structured due to physical constraints and guide the sampling process to regions of high probability. We apply our approach to learning the behavior of pedestrians and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a Learning-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (LB-NMPC) algorithm for an autonomous mobile robot to reduce path-tracking errors over repeated traverses along a reference path. The LB-NMPC algorithm uses a simple a priori vehicle model and a learned disturbance model. Disturbances are modelled as a Gaussian Process (GP) based on experience collected during previous traversals as a function of system state, input and other relevant variables. Modelling the disturbance as a GP enables interpolation and extrapolation of learned disturbances, a key feature of this algorithm. Localization for the controller is provided by an on-board, vision-based mapping and navigation system enabling operation in large-scale, GPS-denied environments. The paper presents experimental results including over 1.8 km of travel by a four-wheeled, 50 kg robot travelling through challenging terrain (including steep, uneven hills) and by a six-wheeled, 160 kg robot learning disturbances caused by unmodelled dynamics at speeds ranging from 0.35 m/s to 1.0 m/s. The speed is scheduled to balance trial time, path-tracking errors, and localization reliability based on previous experience. The results show that the system can start from a generic a priori vehicle model and subsequently learn to reduce vehicle- and trajectory-specific path-tracking errors based on experience.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose the hybrid use of illuminant invariant and RGB images to perform image classification of urban scenes despite challenging variation in lighting conditions. Coping with lighting change (and the shadows thereby invoked) is a non-negotiable requirement for long term autonomy using vision. One aspect of this is the ability to reliably classify scene components in the presence of marked and often sudden changes in lighting. This is the focus of this paper. Posed with the task of classifying all parts in a scene from a full colour image, we propose that lighting invariant transforms can reduce the variability of the scene, resulting in a more reliable classification. We leverage the ideas of \u201cdata transfer\u201d for classification, beginning with full colour images for obtaining candidate scene-level matches using global image descriptors. This is commonly followed by superpixellevel matching with local features. However, we show that if the RGB images are subjected to an illuminant invariant transform before computing the superpixel-level features, classification is significantly more robust to scene illumination effects. The approach is evaluated using three datasets. The first being our own dataset and the second being the KITTI dataset using manually generated ground truth for quantitative analysis. We qualitatively evaluate the method on a third custom dataset over a 750m trajectory.",

        "abstract": "Grasping and manipulation in unstructured environments must handle a wide range of object properties and significant sensing errors. Underactuation and compliance have been shown to be an effective way to improve grasping performance under such uncertainty, but the degree of compliance plays an important role in both gently adapting to sensing errors and maintaining stable grasps of heavy objects. These demands limit the range of objects that can be grasped. We consider the role and required characteristics of tactile sensing as a compensation method when compliance alone is insufficient. By strategic use of contact sensing, it is possible to expand the capabilities of a hand to grasp effectively under a wide range of positioning errors using simple position-driven motors and low-cost hardware.",

In the proposed method, 3D lines are reconstructed using 3D edge points obtained by edge-based SLAM. This is effective for longitudinal lines, e.g., in a corridor, which are hard to reconstruct due to degeneracy and small disparities. A parallel stereo camera cannot reconstruct horizontal lines in the images, and we reconstruct them using the points of intersection with nearby lines. Furthermore, we propose 1D occupancy cell representation for a 3D line segment to determine its range from multiple view images. Experiments show our approach successfully built line-based maps of indoor environments.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a linear approach for solving monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problems. The algorithm first builds a sequence of small initial submaps and then joins these submaps together in a divide-and-conquer (D&C) manner. Each of the initial submap is built using three monocular images by bundle adjustment (BA), which is a simple nonlinear optimization problem. Each step in the D&C submap joining is solved by a linear least squares together with a coordinate and scale transformation. Since the only nonlinear part is in the building of the initial submaps, the algorithm makes it possible to solve large-scale monocular SLAM while avoiding issues associated with initialization, iteration, and local minima that are present in most of the nonlinear optimization based algorithms currently used for large-scale monocular SLAM. Experimental results based on publically available datasets are used to demonstrate that the proposed algorithms yields solutions that are very close to those obtained using global BA starting from good initial guess.",

LPL can be considered as an extension of Linear Hereditary Harrop Formulas (LHHF), whose careful design allows the minimization of nondeterminism in proof search, providing a sufficient basis for the design of linear logic programming languages such as Lolli. Our new language extends on the expressivity of LHHF, while keeping the resulting nondeterminism in proof search to a minimum for efficiency. This paper introduces the LPL language, presents the main ideas behind our theorem prover on a smaller fragment of this language and finally provides an experimental illustration of its operation on the problem of task planning for the hexapod robot RHex.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, Magneto-Rheological (MR) clutches have been increasingly used for realizing compliant actuation. One difficulty in using MR clutches is the existence of nonlinear hysteretic behaviors between the input current and output torque of an MR clutch. In this paper, a new closed-loop, Field-Programable-Gate-Array (FPGA) based control scheme to linearize an MR clutch's input-output relationship is presented. The feedback signal used in this control scheme is the magnetic field acquired from hall sensors within the MR clutch. The FPGA board uses this feedback signal to compensate for the nonlinear behavior of the MR clutch using an estimated model of the clutch magnetic field. The local use of an FPGA board will dramatically simplify the use of MR clutches for torque actuation. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated using an experimental platform that includes an MR clutch as part of a compliant actuation mechanism. The results clearly demonstrate that the use of the FPGA based closed-loop control scheme can effectively eliminate hysteretic behaviors of the MR clutch, allowing to have linear actuators with predictable behaviors.",

        "abstract": "Micro aerial vehicles (MAV) pose a challenge in designing sensory systems and algorithms due to their size and weight constraints and limited computing power. We present an efficient 3D multi-resolution map that we use to aggregate measurements from a lightweight continuously rotating laser scanner. We estimate the robot's motion by means of visual odometry and scan registration, aligning consecutive 3D scans with an incrementally built map. By using local multi-resolution, we gain computational efficiency by having a high resolution in the near vicinity of the robot and a lower resolution with increasing distance from the robot, which correlates with the sensor's characteristics in relative distance accuracy and measurement density. Compared to uniform grids, local multi-resolution leads to the use of fewer grid cells without loosing information and consequently results in lower computational costs. We efficiently and accurately register new 3D scans with the map in order to estimate the motion of the MAV and update the map in-flight. In experiments, we demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency of our registration approach compared to state-of-the-art methods such as GICP. Our approach builds an accurate 3D obstacle map and estimates the vehicle's trajectory in real-time.",

        "abstract": "Industrial environments are rarely static and often their configuration is continuously changing due to the material transfer flow. This is a major challenge for infrastructure free localization systems. In this paper we address this challenge by introducing a localization approach that uses a dual-timescale approach. The proposed approach - Dual-Timescale Normal Distributions Transform Monte Carlo Localization (DT-NDT-MCL) - is a particle filter based localization method, which simultaneously keeps track of the pose using an apriori known static map and a short-term map. The short-term map is continuously updated and uses Normal Distributions Transform Occupancy maps to maintain the current state of the environment. A key novelty of this approach is that it does not have to select an entire timescale map but rather use the best timescale locally. The approach has real-time performance and is evaluated using three datasets with increasing levels of dynamics. We compare our approach against previously proposed NDT-MCL and commonly used SLAM algorithms and show that DT-NDT-MCL outperforms competing algorithms with regards to accuracy in all three test cases.",

        "abstract": "New applications of mobile robotics in dynamic urban areas require more than the single-session geometric maps that have dominated simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) research to date; maps must be updated as the environment changes and include a semantic layer (such as road network information) to aid motion planning in dynamic environments. We present an algorithm for long-term localization and mapping in real time using a three-dimensional (3D) laser scanner. The system infers the static or dynamic state of each 3D point in the environment based on repeated observations. The velocity of each dynamic point is estimated without requiring object models or explicit clustering of the points. At any time, the system is able to produce a most-likely representation of underlying static scene geometry. By storing the time history of velocities, we can infer the dominant motion patterns within the map. The result is an online mapping and localization system specifically designed to enable long-term autonomy within highly dynamic environments. We validate the approach using data collected around the campus of ETH Zurich over seven months and several kilometers of navigation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to unify long-term map update with tracking of dynamic objects.",

        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with how a localised and energy-constrained robot can maximise its time in the field by taking paths and tours that minimise its energy expenditure. A significant component of a robot's energy is expended on mobility and is a function of terrain traversability. We estimate traversability online from data sensed by the robot as it moves, and use this to generate maps, explore and ultimately converge on minimum energy tours of the environment. We provide results of detailed simulations and parameter studies that show the efficacy of this approach for a robot moving over terrain with unknown traversability as well as a number of a priori unknown hard obstacles. We also present preliminary experimental results to show the feasibility of this approach in natural terrain.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a longitudinal wheel-slip controller for four wheel independent steering and drive (4WISD) vehicles is proposed to suppress longitudinal wheel slip in varying road conditions. Different from conventional methods that consider single driving source and zero steering angle, the proposed controller considers all independent traction sources from each driving wheel and omnidirectional steering command so as to eliminate slip detection errors in 4WISD vehicles. The proposed controller requires low cost sensing equipment, including merely wheel speed sensor and accelerometer, which makes the system practical to be utilized. The proposed wheel-slip controller can be applied to vehicles with arbitrary quantity of driving wheels and different steering configurations such as traditional two-front-wheel steering and two-rear-wheel steering. Numerical simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed longitudinal wheel-slip controller.",

        "abstract": "The agility of a robotic system is ultimately limited by the speed of its processing pipeline. The use of a Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), a sensor producing asynchronous events as luminance changes are perceived by its pixels, makes it possible to have a sensing pipeline of a theoretical latency of a few microseconds. However, several challenges must be overcome: a DVS does not provide the grayscale value but only changes in the luminance; and because the output is composed by a sequence of events, traditional frame-based visual odometry methods are not applicable. This paper presents the first visual odometry system based on a DVS plus a normal CMOS camera to provide the absolute brightness values. The two sources of data are automatically spatiotemporally calibrated from logs taken during normal operation. We design a visual odometry method that uses the DVS events to estimate the relative displacement since the previous CMOS frame by processing each event individually. Experiments show that the rotation can be estimated with surprising accuracy, while the translation can be estimated only very noisily, because it produces few events due to very small apparent motion.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper introduces a position-based compliance control algorithm that can be implemented in a lower extremity exoskeleton-supported paraplegia walking task, in which upper body has to be utilized to maintain the overall balance. In order to reduce the upper body effort required during the task, the controller is designated to be capable of managing the position/force trade-off in conjunction with an active admittance regulator scheme. In the case of no force errors, the controller prioritizes position tracking in a way to achieve walking support. Once the force error increases (e.g., ground reaction force peaks, unexpected disturbances, stepping on an object, etc.) the position reference is updated in accordance with the force constraints and active admittance characteristics. By the virtue of this strategy, the human-robot system exhibits enhanced environmental interaction capabilities; therefore, the subject can maintain the overall balance with relatively less upper body effort while walking. Implementing the proposed method, we conducted robot-assisted walking experiments on 4 able-bodied subjects with different body mass index levels and genders. Subjects were instructed to be in passive mode. In addition, walking with severe obstacles was also experimented on a single able-bodied subject. In conclusion, the proposed method enabled us to yield enhanced walking performance comparing to classical rigid position control scheme; indicating that it could potentially introduce a compliant locomotion control alternative for the paraplegia walking support task with a comparatively less amount of upper body effort requirements.",

        "abstract": "Motion planning is a difficult and widely studied problem in robotics. Current research aims not only to find feasible paths, but to ensure paths have certain properties, e.g., shortest or safest paths. This is difficult for current state-of-the-art sampling-based techniques as they typically focus on simply finding any path. Despite this difficulty, sampling-based techniques have shown great success in planning for a wide range of applications. Among such planners, Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) search the planning space by biasing exploration toward unexplored regions. This paper introduces a novel RRT variant, Medial Axis RRT (MARRT), which biases tree exploration to the medial axis of free space by pushing all configurations from expansion steps towards the medial axis. We prove that this biasing increases the tree's clearance from obstacles. Improving obstacle clearance is useful where path safety is important, e.g., path planning for robots performing tasks in close proximity to the elderly. Finally, we experimentally analyze MARRT, emphasizing its ability to effectively map difficult passages while increasing obstacle clearance, and compare it to contemporary RRT techniques.",

Detection in based on the presence of a pressure gradient in the neighborhood of the leak. As the MIT Leak Detector travels through pipes, it picks up the pressure gradient in case of leaks via a carefully designed detector. In this work we demonstrate the performance of the system in a lab setup, which consists of 100mm ID pipes containing pressurized air.",

        "abstract": "Controlling the motion of microrobots based on feedback provided using an imaging modality is essential to make them clinically viable. In this study, we demonstrate the wireless magnetic-based motion control of paramagnetic microparticles using ultrasound feedback. This control is accomplished by pulling the microparticles using the magnetic field gradients towards the reference position through feedback provided by an ultrasound system. First, position of the mi-croparticles is determined using the ultrasound images. Second, calibration of the ultrasound-based tracking of microparticles is achieved and verified using a calibrated microscopic system. Third, the feedback provided by the ultrasound system is used in the implementation of a proportional-derivative magnetic-based control system. This control system allows us to achieve point-to-point control of microparticles with an average position tracking error of 48\u00b159 \u03bcm, whereas a control system based on a microscopic system achieves an average position tracking error of 21\u00b126 \u03bcm. The positioning accuracy accomplished using our ultrasound magnetic-based control system demonstrates the ability to control microrobotic systems in situations where visual feedback cannot be provided via microscopic systems.",

The method to decide the proper strategy from the various candidates depending on the object is a difficult problem and not researched widely. We consider the operation as the mapping from the physical parameter space to the object motion space. Based on the concept of mapping, we define the strategy proving operation (SPO) for determination of strategy feasibility. We introduce two examples of SPO and construct the system for deciding strategy from lifting, pushing, and pivoting. Executing the strategy in the situation that physical parameters are not known is also necessary. We construct the generator and controller for the full-body manipulation, which can be employed regardless of strategy. The controller enables the robot to exert adequate force while keeping balance. We clarify the applicable scope of the proposed method and show that a life-sized humanoid decides the strategy and carries various large and heavy objects autonomously through the experiment.",

Manual guidance is a general model of physical interaction: here we focus on guiding a humanoid by its hands. The proposed technique can be, however, used also for joint object transportation and other tasks implying human-humanoid physical interaction. Using a measure of the Instantaneous Capture Point, we develop an equilibrium-based interaction technique that does not require force/torque or vision sensors. It is, therefore, particularly suitable for low-cost humanoids and toys. The proposed method has been experimentally validated on the small humanoid NAO.",

Since raw readings from RFID readers only provide information on positive read attempts, i.e. the detections of a tag, we propose an outlier filter method solely based on the spatial extent of the sensor model that is used for the mapping process. Furthermore, we use this filter to actually classify detections as well as non-detections of tags into valid and invalid positive as well as negative detection events. We incorporate the different classes into our mapping pipeline and introduce several extensions to improve the mapping accuracy. Experimental results including the classification and mapping accuracy are presented to prove the effectiveness of our approach.",

The microphone array is used to estimate the sound power received from different directions whereas the laser range sensors are used for estimating the platform pose in the environment. During navigation, a ray casting method projects the audio measurements made onboard the mobile platform to the map of the environment. Experimental results show that the created map is an efficient tool for sound source localization.",

These obstacles cannot be clearly distinguished even with the state of the art depth sensors or laser range finders using existing vision based algorithms. With the advent of sophisticated image processing algorithms like SLIC [1] and LSD [9], it is possible to extract rich information from an image which led us to develop a novel architecture to detect very small obstacles on the floor using a monocular camera. This information is further processed using a Markov Random Field based graph cut formalism that precisely segments the floor and detects obstacles which are extremely low. We show robust and accurate obstacle detection and floor segmentation in diverse environments over a large variety of objects found indoors. In our case, low lying obstacles, changing floor patterns and extremely homogeneous environments are properly classified which leads to a drastic decrease in the number of obstacles that may not be classified by existing robotic vision algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Over the years, proposals have been made to employ line segments to build 2D maps of indoor environments. One of the basic steps of these approaches is the matching between scans (or, more generally, sets) of line segments, which is usually addressed using variants of the Iterative Closest Line (ICL) paradigm. ICL is based on the idea of associating closest line segments belonging to the two scans and of reducing the distance between them. In this paper, we propose two algorithms that go beyond this approach by exploiting the mutual compatibility between associations of line segments. Experimental results show that our algorithms significantly outperform, in terms of matching accuracy, traditional algorithms based on ICL, at the cost of a slightly longer execution time.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view method for surface reconstruction from matched line segments with applications to robotic mapping and image-based rendering. Starting from 3D line segments, plane hypotheses are formed for all non-collinear and sufficiently coplanar segment pairs. The surface that is spanned by two segments is used to immediately prune hypotheses that do not pass a sight line occlusion check to keep the initial plane number tractable. After further merging, exhaustive intersections are computed in an efficient way to yield a maximally informative surface representation. Finally, robustified visibility constraints are used to recover a dense surface mesh that is a pessimistic representation of the free space, which is desirable for path planning applications. The presented system is a complete and automatic solution suitable for mapping an environment in realtime scenarios like robotic exploration. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on several indoor scenes with varying complexity.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we address the issue of coordinating the trajectories of two collaborating robots in environments with obstacles so that visibility between them is maximized in the presence of competing constraints. Specifically, we examine the problem of allowing one robot (the \u201cphotographer\u201d) to follow another robot (\u201cthe subject\u201d) through a planar environment while maintaining visual contact to the maximum degree consistent with an efficient traversal. This problem has numerous applications, for instance in scenarios where communication between robots requires line-of-sight. We formalize this problem in the context of centralized kinodynamic planning and we present solutions based on the asymptotically optimal sampling-based RRT* planner. We discuss connections to the traditional formulation of pursuit-evasion games where the analysis typically ends the moment the evader manages to escape the pursuer's visibility region. We also illustrate types of environments and other conditions under which allowing the pair of robots to break the line-of-sight is a better option than always requiring the presence of visual contact.",

To ensure opacity, a controller may be used to control information released to the public. For transparency and other reasons, it is often desired the information released to the public be maximum, as long as opacity is not violated. In this paper, we investigate how to release the maximum information while ensuring opacity. We find a necessary and sufficient condition for a control policy to ensure opacity. We also develop methods and algorithms to design a controller that releases maximum information. We consider both strong opacity and weak opacity.",

The new proposed arm using a very common and low cost inflatable material, and it is very light, which weight is only about 50 grams, but can well realize agile movement by driving three tiny cables installed in shoulder joint and elbow joint, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed cable driven mechanism also allows connecting numbers of joints easily. The soft inflatable can work just by pumping air with very low pressure (7.32 \u00b1 3.45 kPa), and allows human directly and safely contact without any external sensors. Moreover, to solve the challenge problems of soft joint deformation, the kinematic modeling of the joint with deformation compensation is also developed. Experimental results show that the soft inflatable arm can agilely move for remote interaction. The workspace and velocity are also close to an adult's arm movement space and normal motion speed.",

Instead of implementing postural synergies digitally, this paper presents the design of a simple continuum mechanism for implementing the postural synergies mechanically. The design, fabrication and assembly of a prosthetic hand are firstly presented, followed by the synthesis of postural synergies from various grasping poses. Referring to the extracted postural synergies, structural parameters of the continuum mechanism are calculated based on a kinematics model. Experimental verifications are also presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed idea.",

The basic idea is to find out coherent subsequences of confidence in trajectory to ensure against error-prone correspondences. It is achieved by leveraging fuzzy matching based on local trajectory structure and measurement similarity. Our approach does not rely on any global features or propagation modeling, which can be unreliable in the presence of gross errors and result in divergence. Apart from WiFi SLAM, our approach can also be capable of improving generic SLAM problems by leveraging spatio-temporal coherence. The experiments show that our approach can significantly reduce the ambiguity in WiFi fingerprinting, and subsequently lead to performance improvement in terms of mapping and localization.",

We rely on an air-ground image matching algorithm to search the airborne image of the MAV within a ground-level Street View image database and to detect image matching points. Based on the image matching points, we infer the global position of the MAV by back-projecting the corresponding image points onto a cadastral 3D city model. Furthermore, we describe an algorithm to track the position of the flying vehicle over several frames and to correct the accumulated drift of the visual odometry, whenever a good match is detected between the airborne MAV and the street-level images. The proposed approach is tested on a dataset captured with a small quadroctopter flying in the streets of Zurich.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a mobile robot localization system in frequent GPS-denied situations. We utilize multiple observations that are obtained from sequential appearance-based place recognition and GPS. Using GPS observations has still some challenging problems such as multipath or signal lost under environments where there are tall buildings nearby. The appearance-based place recognition that is combined with positional information has capability to overcome the issue. Nevertheless, GPS observations which are obtained in the situation sometimes have better quality (e.g. Precision or accuracy) than positional information from the place recognition because those coordinates always have some errors. We apply both of observations to a mobile robot localization for the sake of achieving robust localization. Moreover sequential appearance-based place recognition makes it possible to recognize their own position even when we navigate a robot at night. Our system uses not only multiple observations but also dead reckoning with the gyrodometry model. Our experiments are performed over aggregate 5300 m trajectory approximately that contains three times trials through a 1600 m outdoor route in different seasons and at different times, and once trail through a 500 m short-range route to verify its validity.",

Dedicated surgical robots significantly improve surgeon's skills especially for tasks requiring high precision such as lead placement and suturing. However, these robotic setups do not allow yet beating heart surgery with motion compensation functionalities. This paper tackles autonomous heart motion compensation with force feedback. We propose a cascade model predictive control (MPC) architecture with a Kalman Active Observer (AOB) in the loop, and compare it with the classical MPC approach. The cascade MPC-AOB control architecture has two loops. The inner one performs model-reference adaptive control, guaranteeing a desired force tracking dynamics. The outer one generates control actions to compensate physiological motions. Both MPC-based architectures are analyzed and experimentally evaluated. Two robots are used. A lightweight 4-DoF surgical robot generates desired surgical forces and a 3-DoF robot equipped with an ex vivo heart at the end-effector reproduces realistic heart motions.",

        "abstract": "Screw path drilling is an important process among many orthopedic surgeries. To guarantee the safety and correctness of this process, a model-based drilling state recognition method is proposed in this paper. The thrust force in the drilling process is modeled based on an accurate 3D bone model restructured by means of Micro-CT images. In theoretical modeling of the thrust force, the resistance and the elasticity of the bone tissues are considered. The cutting energy and elastic modulus are defined as the material parameters in the theoretical model, which are identified via a least square method. Some key parameters are proposed to support the state recognition: the peak forces in the first and the second cortical layers, the average force in the cancellous layer and the thickness of each layer. Based on these key parameters in the model, a state recognition strategy with a robotic orthopedic surgery system is proposed to recognize the switch position of each layer. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the modeling approach and the state recognition method.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "On a new demand of safe human-robot interaction for robotic applications, the Compact Compliant Actuator, named CompActTM, is recently developed with physical compliance and active variable damping. In this mechanism, a desired physical damping behavior is realized by generating a friction force which is actively controlled by piezoelectric actuators (PEAs). However, nonlinearities such as hysteresis and creep effect make difficult to precisely control the generated piezoelectric force. This paper focuses on a development of precise force tracking controller for PEAs. A time delay estimation (TDE) using a force feedback is newly proposed to compensate a hysteretic behavior of the PEA and external uncertainties without a mathematical model. Thanks to the force-based TDE, the proposed control is accurate, computationally efficient and easily implementable on the real PEA system. The proposed control scheme is experimentally verified on the CompActTM. Root-mean-square values of the steady-state error for step commands are kept as less than error ratio of 0.13 % and the closed-loop system bandwidth for sinusoidal commands of 20 N stroke is confirmed as about 11 Hz under 100 N payload. In addition, the stability of the proposed control is proved to be bounded-input-bounded-output (BIBO) stable.",

Such a fractional-order model offers the possibility of general applicability, particularly in the case of heterogeneous fleets of robots. Such systems tend to be very high order, and therefore model reduction is useful in modeling, simulation and control. Results are presented for the system considered illustrating that the fractional-order model achieves significant computational savings compared to simulating the full system.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we describe design and development of a 3-axis proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for a holonomic precision inchworm robot. The mechanism has two Y-shaped electromagnets and six piezoelectric actuators (PAs) for obtaining 3-degrees-of-freedom (3DoF) motion on well-polished ferromagnetic surfaces. To measure its 3DoF position simultaneously, an integrated 3DoF inner position sensor composed of 4 linear encoders are developed. In experiments, we have checked that this arrangement of the encoders is valid for measuring the 3DoF motion under a condition without disturbance. To be robust against the disturbance, we also discuss requirement of an acceleration feedforward controller with 3 motion sensors to detect disturbance and slips of supporting electromagnet. This paper is first article which demonstrates simultaneous 3-axis PID control with nanometer-scale positioning resolution of miniature mobile robot driven by PAs. We also discuss about the future direction of the realization of compact, precise, fast, flexible, and energy-efficient mobile robotic factory.",

        "abstract": "During the last years robotic researchers have been able of developing extremely complex applications. The complexity of these applications is reflected by the variety of functionalities involved, which are provided by a significant number of components. Although the reuse of software components is becoming a best-practice, the reuse of reference architectures, which model sub-systems providing functionalities common to a great number of applications, is still uncommon. This paper provides two contributions to this topic: (a) a development process that defines how reference architectures can be exploited for building robotic applications, (b) the HyperFlex software toolchain, which has been developed for supporting the design and the reuse of reference architectures. The idea presented in this paper is simple yet powerful: instead of building complex applications by reusing single components, even more complex applications can be developed by reusing reference architectures of mature sub-systems.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a dynamic model is proposed for a carangiform-like robotic fish swimming both forwards and backwards. The robotic fish, which consists of a streamlined head, a flexible body and a caudal fin, is able to propel itself by generating a traveling propulsive wave traversing its body. We first modify the classical body wave function suggested by Lighthill to fit our robotic fish. Then we naturally define the point on fish's body which never undulates during swimming straight as \u201cFixed-point\u201d and prove its existence and uniqueness. Using the property of the Fixed-point, we propose a model for our robotic fish and further investigate how the swimming speed is affected by the position of the unique Fixed-point. It is found that the robotic fish achieves its maximum speed of swimming forwards and backwards when the Fixed-point located on the head and the tail, respectively. Finally, we apply the proposed model combining with a CPG-based locomotion controller to the real robotic fish. Both simulations and experiments show that the proposed model is capable to predict the speed of the robotic fish.",

The model predicts success for perching over a range of initial conditions. The model also predicts the conditions under which other directional attachment technologies, such as microspines, will succeed. Experiments conducted using a launching mechanism for a range of different landing conditions confirm the predictions of the model and provide insight into future design improvements that are possible by modifying a few key damping and stiffness parameters.",

First, we briefly introduce our assistive human-robot interaction (HRI) interface and a virtual fixture as backgrounds related to this research. The designed HRI interface provides assistance by actively constraining the user-control with a virtual fixture. Second, we discuss a way to model a user's driving-characteristics in a steering task. In modeling the driving-characteristics, we use techniques from inverse optimal control (IOC), where known basis functions (speed, steering, and proximities to inner/outer road boundary) are employed to design a cost function. Third, we describe the experimental setup and procedures to obtain user-demonstrated data from human subjects. Utilizing the obtained data sets, we infer the unknown parameter vector by solving inverse optimal control. Afterward, the user's driving-characteristics are expressed in terms of the balances of the inferred parameters, allowing us to find a relationship between the modeled driving-characteristics and task-completion time. Finally, we present a method to set a virtual fixture for a newly given task by predicting the user's task-performances.",

        "abstract": "A dragline-forming technology has been previously proposed to enable locomotion through an open-space where no solid surfaces present. The technology is intended for situations where payload requirements are unanticipated. In those situations, variability in dragline's diameter can minimize the use of material hence increase self-sufficiency of the robot. In a previous study, a robot was designed, prototyped and proven to be able to descend through an open-space by forming a thermoplastic dragline with a diameter range of 1.1\u20134.5 mm. However, the speed of locomotion was rather low due to the lack of an adequate control method for thermoplastic dragline formation. In this paper, models of mass flow and thermodynamics along dragline formation pathway are presented. The models are validated in a newly prototyped robot which forms a dragline continuously. Experiment results show that, when compared to the previous prototype and control method which consists of repeated sequences of discrete events, the speed of descending locomotion is significantly increased and reaches 12.0 cm/min.",

However, it is widely known that applying the inverse sensor model to mapping requires certain assumptions that are not necessarily true. Even the works that use forward sensor models have relied on methods like expectation maximization or Gibbs sampling which have been succeeded by more effective methods of maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference over graphical models. In this paper, we propose the use of modern MAP inference methods along with the forward sensor model. Our implementation and experimental results demonstrate that these modern inference methods deliver more accurate maps more efficiently than previously used methods.",

        "abstract": "Robotic endoscopes have the potential to help endoscopists position tools during procedures, to propel the endoscope to the desired position, to automate functions and to prevent perforations during procedures. This paper outlines the modular architecture for a continuum robotic endoscope with multiple bending segments along the length of the endoscope. Each of the segments is modular, containing a set of actuation motors that drive short cables in the continuum segments. Each modular segment of the robot is 15 mm in diameter, can turn 180 degrees and has a turning speed ranging from 35 to 250 degrees per second. The robot is composed of seven of these modular segments, has 14 degrees of freedom, is 0.91 m long and has a mass of 157 grams. The implementation for the mechanical, electrical, and software design is described and the robotic endoscope bending motions are sensed, simulated and controlled using kinematic models. Lastly, path planning trajectories of the endoscope segments are designed and coordinated to help propel the robot forward in an uncoiling motion and in a follow-the-leader fashion along a path that emulates simplified turns in a colon. We show that the robotic endoscope is able to exert less force on the walls of the colon emulation path, enable automated insertion into the patient, and execute colon wall avoidance and linear scanning motions not available in conventional endoscopes.",

        "abstract": "Battery management system has attracted mounting research attention recently, within which cell equalization plays a key role. Although many research and practices have been devoted to developing system-level structure of cell equalizers, there are still substantial opportunities for performance improvement yet to investigate. This paper proposes a novel architecture for battery cell equalization, referred to as modularized global equalizer. The mathematical model is developed to emulate the equalization dynamics by considering both charging/discharging and energy loss. Analytical formulas are derived to evaluate the performance of the global equalizer. The proposed method is also compared with the state-of-the-art structures in terms of equalization speed and energy loss.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we tackle the problem of mapping multiple 3D rigid structures and estimating their motions from perspective views through a car-mounted camera. The proposed method complements conventional localization and mapping algorithms (such as Visual Odometry and SLAM) to estimate motions of other moving objects in addition to the vehicle's motion. We present a theoretical framework for robust estimation of multiple motions and structures from perspective images. The method is based on the factorization of the projective trajectory matrix without explicit estimation of projective depth values. We exploit the epipolar geometry of calibrated cameras to generate several hypotheses for motion segments. Once the hypotheses are obtained, they are evaluated in an iterative scheme by alternating between estimation of 3D structures and estimation of multiple motions. The proposed framework does not require any knowledge about the number of motions and is robust to noisy image measurements. The method is evaluated on street-level sequences from a car-mounted camera. A benchmark dataset is also used to compare the results with previous works, although most of the related works use synthetic scenes simulating desktop environments.",

        "abstract": "Previous work has shown that classical sequential decision making rules, including expectimax and minimax, are limit cases of a more general class of bounded rational planning problems that trade off the value and the complexity of the solution, as measured by its information divergence from a given reference. This allows modeling a range of novel planning problems having varying degrees of control due to resource constraints, risk-sensitivity, trust and model uncertainty. However, so far it has been unclear in what sense information constraints relate to the complexity of planning. In this paper, we introduce Monte Carlo methods to solve the generalized optimality equations in an efficient & exact way when the inverse temperatures in a generalized decision tree are of the same sign. These methods highlight a fundamental relation between inverse temperatures and the number of Monte Carlo proposals. In particular, it is seen that the number of proposals is essentially independent of the size of the decision tree.",

However, to be useful in a robotic context, the model provided to an AI planner should afford both symbolic and metric constructs; its expressiveness should not hinder computational efficiency; and it should include causal, spatial, temporal and resource aspects of the domain. We propose a planner grounded on well-founded constraint-based calculi that adhere to these requirements. A proof of completeness is provided, and the flexibility and portability of the approach is validated through several experiments on real and simulated robot platforms.",

The proposed control scheme has analytically guaranteed stability and convergence properties, while its applicability and performance are experimentally verified using the Girona500 AUV into two different missions: a) navigation and stabilization to a specific configuration, b) meandrus-like trajectory tracking. In both cases the vehicle was under the influence of time-varying external disturbances caused by a high-pressure water jet installed on the Girona500 manipulator.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method on the motion and path planning for unicycle robots in environments with static circular obstacles. The method employs a family of 2-dimensional analytic vector fields, which have singular points of high-order type and whose integral curves exhibit various patterns depending on the value of a parameter \u03bb. More specifically, for a known value of \u03bb the vector field has a unique singular point of dipole type and its integral curves are suitable for steering the unicycle to a goal configuration. Furthermore, for the value of \u03bb that the vector field has a continuum of singular points, the integral curves can be used to define flows around circular obstacles. An almost global feedback motion plan is then constructed by suitably blending attractive and repulsive vector fields in a static obstacle environment. The proposed motion planning and control design is also extended to the multi-agent case, where each agent needs to converge to a desired configuration while avoiding collisions with other agents. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated via simulation results.",

        "abstract": "Paramagnetic microparticles moving through fluids have the potential to be used in many applications, including microassembly, micromanipulation, and highly localized delivery of therapeutic agents inside the human body. Paramagnetic microparticles with diameters of approximately 100 \u03bcm can be wirelessly controlled by externally applying magnetic field gradients using electromagnets. In this paper, we introduce a motion planner to guide a spherical paramagnetic microparticle to a target while avoiding obstacles. The motion planner explicitly considers uncertainty in the microparticle's motion and maximizes the probability that the microparticle avoids obstacle collisions and reaches the target. To enable effective consideration of uncertainty, we use an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to learn a stochastic model of the uncertainty in microparticle motion and state sensing from experiments conducted in a 3D 8-electromagnet microparticle testbed. We apply the motion planner in a simulated 3D environment with static obstacles and demonstrate that the computed plans are more likely to result in task success than plans based on traditional metrics such as shortest path or maximum clearance.",

        "abstract": "Advanced modern humanoid robots often have complex manipulators with a large number of degrees of freedom. Thus, motion planning for such manipulators is a very computationally challenging problem. However, often robotic manipulators allow the wrist degrees of freedom to be controlled independently from the configuration of the rest of the arm. In this paper we show how to split the high dimensional planning problem into two lower-dimensional sub-problems \u2014 planning for the main arm joints and planning for the wrist joints, without losing guarantees on completeness. This approach is an extension of our previously developed framework for planning with adaptive dimensionality. Experimentally, we show that this approach is very effective in speeding up planning for robotic arms on Willow Garage's PR2 platform. We compare our algorithm with several popular alternative approaches for performing motion planning for robotic arms. The results we observe illustrate that our algorithm provides a good balance between planning time, planning success rate, path consistency, and path quality.",

        "abstract": "Kinematic planning for robotic arms has been shown to be capable of planning for robust manipulation of static objects. However, this approach falls short when manipulating moving objects such as picking up a jar off of a conveyor belt at a bottling plant. The challenge in carefully picking up moving objects is that these actions require motions that do not involve large decelerations, to avoid jerking the object, as well as figuring out the proper time in which the object can be picked up. We present a search-based kinodynamic motion planning algorithm that generates a time-parameterized trajectory for both the arm and end-effector, capable of carefully picking up the object at the earliest feasible point in its trajectory. To combat the high-dimensionality of the time-parameterized kinodynamic planning problem, our approach employs informative heuristics and adaptive dynamic motion primitives. To validate our approach, we used a 7DOF manipulator on Willow Garage's PR2 robot to pickup objects off of a conveyor belt. We also provide a detailed set of results that demonstrate the planner's ability to generate consistent, low cost trajectories for manipulation.",

The future motion of traffic participants is predicted using a local planner, and the uncertainty along the predicted trajectory is computed based on Gaussian propagation. For the autonomous vehicle, the uncertainty from localization and control is estimated based on a Linear-Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) framework. Compared with other safety assessment methods, our framework allows the planner to avoid unsafe situations more efficiently, thanks to the direct uncertainty information feedback to the planner. We also demonstrate our planner's ability to generate safer trajectories compared to planning only with a LQG framework.",

        "abstract": "Equipping mobile robots with an omnidirectional camera is very advantageous in numerous applications as all information about the surrounding scene is stored in a single image frame. In the given context, the present paper is concerned with detection, tracking and following of a moving object with an omnidirectional camera. The camera calibration and image formation is based on the spherical unified projection model thus yielding a representation of the omnidirectional image on the unit sphere. Detection of moving objects is performed by calculating a sparse optical flow in the image and then lifting the flow vectors on the unit sphere where they are discriminated as dynamic or static by analytically calculating the distance of the terminal vector point to a great circle arc. The flow vectors are then clustered and the center of gravity is calculated to form the sensor measurement. Furthermore, the tracking is posed as a Bayesian estimation problem on the unit sphere and the solution based on the von Mises-Fisher distribution is utilized. Visual servoing is performed for the object following task where the control law calculation is based on the projection of a point on the unit sphere. Experimental results obtained by a camera with a fish-eye lens mounted on a differential drive mobile robot are presented and discussed.",

Other methods which use additional channels, such as color or intensity, often use only a small fraction of the available information and ignore the underlying structural information of the added channels. The proposed method incorporates the additional channels directly into the scan registration formulation to provide information within the plane of the surface. This is achieved by calculating the uncertainty both along and perpendicular to the local surface at each point and calculating nearest neighbour correspondences in the higher dimensional space. The proposed method reduces instances of degenerate transformation estimates and improves both registration accuracy and convergence rate. The method is tested on the Ford Vision and Lidar dataset using both color and intensity channels as well as on Microsoft Kinect data obtained from the University of Waterloo campus.",

Our aim is to embed the meeting process within a background activity such that the agents travel through the rendezvous location while taking the shortest paths to their respective target locations. We analyze this problem in a street network scenario with two agents who are given their individual scheduled routes to complete with an underlying common goal. The agents are allowed to select any combination of the waypoints along their routes as long as they travel the shortest path and pass through the same potential rendezvous location. The total number of path combinations that the agents need to evaluate for the shortest path increases rapidly with the number of waypoints along their routes. We address this computational cost by proposing a combination of Euclidean and street network distances for a trade-off between the number of queries and a distance optimal solution.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Lower-limb wearable robots have been proposed as a means to augment or assist the wearer's natural performance, in particular, in the military and medical field. Previous research studies on human-robot interaction and biomechanics have largely been performed with rigid exoskeletons that add significant inertia to the lower extremities and provide constraints to the wearer's natural kinematics in both actuated and non-actuated degrees of freedom. Actuated lightweight soft exosuits minimize these effects and provide a unique opportunity to study human-robot interaction in wearable systems without affecting the subjects underlying natural dynamics. In this paper, we present the design and control of a reconfigurable multi-joint actuation platform that can provide biologically realistic torques to ankle, knee, and hip joints through lower extremity soft exosuits. Two different soft exosuits have been designed to deliver assistive forces through Bowden cable transmission to the ankle and hip joints. Through human subject experiments, it is demonstrated that with a real-time admittance controller, accurate force profile tracking can be achieved during walking. The average energy delivered to the test subject was calculated while walking at 1.25 m/s and actuated with 15% of the total torque required by the biological joints. The results show that the ankle joint received an average of 3.02J during plantar flexion and that the hip joint received 1.67J during flexion each gait cycle. The efficiency of the described suit and controller in transferring energy to the human biological joints is 70% for the ankle and 48% for the hip.",

Different from existing work purely relying on gradient measurement, the transport model of pollution source is explicitly considered in tracking control design. We first study the problem using a single robot and solve the problem in an estimation and control framework. We then extend it to the multi-robot case in a nearest-neighbor communication structure, and have the robots take formation along the plume front. The distributed control is scalable to a large number of robots. Simulation results show satisfactory performances of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a distributed formation control method for a group of robots. The global objective of achieving a desired formation is obtained by dividing it into a set of local objectives which are achieved in a distributed manner. A basic repetitive pattern in the desired formation is identified and a corresponding unique differentiable task function is defined based on the position coordinates of the robots forming the pattern. Neighbor selection rules are designed for the robots in such a way that each robot is part of one or more such patterns. A singularity-robust task-priority inverse kinematics method is used to design velocity controllers to achieve these patterns. Since a robot can receive multiple control actions being part of multiple task functions or patterns, a distributed null space behavioral (NSB) approach is designed to combine such multiple control actions in a prioritized way. A comprehensive stability analysis of the proposed approach based on Lyapunov methods is presented. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Considering the conditions of real world environments where the chemical concentration distribution is patchy, intermittent and time-variant, we propose a method to incorporate the temporal and spatial aspect of sensory data into the problem of odor distribution mapping. Despite the previous works in this field, the method gives more importance to the recent acquired measurements and also to the measurements which have been spatially closer to the place of the sensors (at the time of their acquisition). Real experiments were done in a realistic small-scale controlled environment (designed for systematic olfactory tests), considering up to five real robots and two different navigation algorithms. Experiments show that the generated odor maps are remarkably more accurate than the results of the conventional spatial interpolation method. Studying various spatio-temporal neighborhoods in the time series analysis concluded that a proper definition of the neighborhood (in time and space) provides accurate results in gas distribution mapping.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for multirobot pose graph localization and data association without requiring prior knowledge about the initial relative poses of the robots. Without a common reference frame, the robots can only share observations of interesting parts of the environment, and trying to match between observations from different robots will result in many outlier correspondences. Our approach is based on the following key observation: while each multi-robot correspondence can be used in conjunction with the local robot estimated trajectories, to calculate the transformation between the robot reference frames, only the inlier correspondences will be similar to each other. Using this concept, we develop an expectation-maximization (EM) approach to efficiently infer the robot initial relative poses and solve the multi-robot data association problem. Once this transformation between the robot reference frames is estimated with sufficient measure of confidence, we show that a similar EM formulation can be used to solve also the full multi-robot pose graph problem with unknown multi-robot data association. We evaluate the performance of the developed approach both in a statistical synthetic-environment study and in a real-data experiment, demonstrating its robustness to high percentage of outliers.",

We mimic this hierarchical framework by training arrays of Support Vector Machines to recognize places at multiple spatial scales. Place match hypotheses are then cross-validated across all spatial scales, a process which combines the spatial specificity of the finest spatial map with the consensus provided by broader mapping scales. Experiments on three real-world datasets including a large robotics benchmark demonstrate that mapping over multiple scales uniformly improves place recognition performance over a single scale approach without sacrificing localization accuracy. We present analysis that illustrates how matching over multiple scales leads to better place recognition performance and discuss several promising areas for future investigation.",

We present a novel approach for learning a nonlinear feedback policy that generalizes across multiple tasks. The key idea is to define a parametrized policy as a function of both the state and the task, which allows learning a single policy that generalizes across multiple known and unknown tasks.

        "abstract": "Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) gather large volumes of visual imagery, which can help monitor marine ecosystems and plan future surveys. One key task in marine ecology is benthic habitat mapping, the classification of large regions of the ocean floor into broad habitat categories. Since visual data only covers a small fraction of the ocean floor, traditional habitat mapping is performed using shipborne acoustic multi-beam data, with visual data as ground truth. However, given the high resolution and rich textural cues in visual data, an ideal approach should explicitly utilise visual features in the classification process. To this end, we propose a multimodal model which utilises visual data and shipborne multi-beam bathymetry to perform both classification and sampling tasks. Our algorithm learns the relationship between both modalities, but is also effective when visual data is missing. Our results suggest that by performing multimodal learning, classification performance is improved in scenarios where visual data is unavailable, such as the habitat mapping scenario. We also demonstrate empirically that the model is able to perform generative tasks, producing plausible samples from the underlying data-generating distribution.",

The maps are generated using a long-term and short-term memory mechanism that ensures only persistent configurations in the environment are selected to create the maps. In order to evaluate the proposed method, experimentation is conducted in an office environment. Compared to navigation systems that use only one map, our system produces superior path planning and navigation in a non-stationary environment where paths can be blocked periodically, a common scenario which poses significant challenges for typical planners.",

The core idea is to design a controller first and then find springs working in parallel with each actuator such that force-displacement graph is lined up around displacement axis. By doing so, we simply shape the natural dynamics for performing the task efficiently. Maximum torque reduction for actuators is a byproduct of this design method. The method can be used in different cyclic robotic application, especially in legged locomotion systems. In this paper, we design a spinal compliance for a bounding quadruped robot in Webots. The results show that the power consumption and the maximum torque are reduced significantly.",

In this work, relying on the observations on human bimanual coordination, a novel realtime motion control strategy is proposed to regulate the desired Cartesian stiffness profile during the execution of bimanual tasks. The novelty of the proposed control scheme relies on the use of common mode stiffness (CMS) and configuration dependent stiffness (CDS) to regulate the size and directionality of the task space stiffness ellipsoid. Thanks to the CDS control, the proposed scheme is not only proved to be effective in regulating the desired stiffness ellipsoid but also permits to resolve the manipulator redundancy in a natural manner. The effectiveness of the controller is evaluated in an experimental setup in which two cooperating robotic arms are executing an assembly task. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed dual-arm CDS-CMS controller is effective in tracking the desired stiffness ellipsoids as well as in producing human-like natural motions for the two robotic arms.",

In this work, we aim at solving the 2.5D navigation problem solely on point-cloud. The proposed method is independent of traditional surface parametrization or reconstruction methods, such as a meshing process, which generally has high computational complexity. Instead, we utilize the output of 3D tensor voting framework (TVF) using raw point-clouds. A novel local Riemannian metric is defined based on the saliency components of TVF, which helps the modeling of the latent traversable surface. Using this metric, we prove that the geodesic in the 3D tensor space leads to rational path-planning results. Compared to traditional methods, the results reveal the advantages of the proposed method in terms of facilitating the robot maneuver with minimum movement.",

Excessive artifacts and low resolution of the US images make it difficult to detect the needle and its tip. It is possible to enhance the needle image using image processing; and this work proposes a novel needle detection method in 2D US images based on the Gabor filter. This method enhances the needle outline while suppressing the other structures in the image. First, the needle insertion angle is estimated and then the needle trajectory is found with the RANSAC line estimator. The experiments with three different phantoms showed that the algorithm is robust and could work in percutaneous needle procedures using US images.",

        "abstract": "Percutaneous needle insertions are commonly performed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Accurate placement of the needle tip is important to the success of many needle procedures. The current needle steering systems depend on needle-tissue-specific data, such as maximum curvature, that is unavailable prior to an interventional procedure. In this paper, we present a novel three-dimensional adaptive steering method for flexible bevel-tipped needles that is capable of performing accurate tip placement without previous knowledge about needle curvature. The method steers the needle by integrating duty-cycled needle steering, online curvature estimation, ultrasound-based needle tracking, and sampling-based motion planning. The needle curvature estimation is performed online and used to adapt the path and duty cycling. We evaluated the method using experiments in a homogenous gelatin phantom, a two-layer gelatin phantom, and a biological tissue phantom composed of a gelatin layer and in vitro chicken tissue. In all experiments, virtual obstacles and targets move in order to represent the disturbances that might occur due to tissue deformation and physiological processes. The average targeting error using our new adaptive method is 40% lower than using the conventional non-adaptive duty-cycled needle steering method.",

        "abstract": "Robotic swarms are distributed systems whose members interact via local control laws to achieve different behaviors. Practical missions may require a combination of different swarm behaviors, where these behavioral combinations are not known a priori but could arise dynamically due to changes in mission goals. Therefore, human interaction with the swarm (HIS) is needed. In this paper, we introduce, formally define and characterize a novel concept, Neglect Benevolence, that captures the idea that it may be beneficial for system performance if the human operator, after giving a command, waits for some time before giving a subsequent command to the swarm. This raises the important question of the existence and means of calculation of the optimal time for the operator to give input to the swarm in order to optimize swarm behavior. Human operators are limited in their ability to estimate the best time to give input to the swarm. Therefore, automated aids that calculate the optimal input time could help the human operator achieve the best system performance. Our contributions are as follows. First, we formally define the new notion of Neglect Benevolence. Second, we prove the existence of Neglect Benevolence for a class of linear dynamical systems. Third, we provide an analytic characterization and an algorithm for calculating the optimal input time. Fourth, we apply the analysis to the human control of swarm configuration.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new marker for robot programming by demonstration through motion imitation. The device is based on high intensity LEDs (light emission diodes) which are captured by a pair of industrial cameras. Using stereoscopy, the marker supplies 6-DoF (degrees of freedom) human wrist tracking with both position and orientation data. We propose a robust technique for camera and stereo calibration which maps camera coordinates directly into the desired robot frame, using a single LED. The calibration and tracking procedures are thoroughly described. The tests show that the marker presents a new robust, accurate and intuitive method for industrial robot programming. The system is able to perform in real-time and requires only a single pair of industrial cameras though more can be used for improved effectiveness and accuracy.",

The system consists of a rod-shaped microrobot, a magnetic actuation system and a visual control system. A rotating magnetic field induces the microrobot to roll on the supporting surface, thereby creating a vortex in a liquid environment. This vortex enables the robot to trap and transport even delicate objects in a non-contact manner to a pre-defined position. We present the micro-agent, the actuation system and the visual control system to achieve this automated procedure.",

Here we present a non-monologue speech synthesis for robots. We collected a speech corpus in a non-monologue style in which two professional voice talents read scripted dialogues. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) were then trained with the corpus and used for speech synthesis. We conducted experiments in which the proposed method was evaluated by 24 subjects in three scenarios: text-reading, dialogue, and domestic service robot (DSR) scenarios. In the DSR scenario, we used a physical robot and compared our proposed method with a baseline method using the standard Mean Opinion Score (MOS) criterion. Our experimental results showed that our proposed method's performance was (1) at the same level as the baseline method in the text-reading scenario and (2) exceeded it in the DSR scenario. We deployed our proposed system as a cloud-based speech synthesis service so that it can be used without any cost.",

        "abstract": "Thermal soaring can vastly increase the effectiveness of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in information gathering tasks. However, knowing when to best collect information or regain energy is non-trivial. In this work, the problem is posed as a graph search problem where nodes are thermal positions, and edges are inter-thermal trajectories. Previous work has shown that this search problem is NP-hard, such that computing a long-duration plan is difficult without significant computational effort. This paper introduces two mechanisms to make this tractable. Firstly, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is used to provide an anytime search strategy capable of generating long plans without exhaustive search. Secondly, a novel clustering approach isolates areas of interest on the information map to solve local cluster subproblems, followed by dynamic programming to optimally allocate search time to each cluster. Results demonstrate the improved performance of these approaches on longer missions.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new nonparametric approach for cooperative localisation and tracking by fusing relative range measurements between mobile network equipped nodes. Standard approaches based on parametric methods are known to be limited to problems that contain Gaussian properties. This paper overcomes this limitation by proposing a novel particle filter based cooperative tracking approach that is suitable for mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs). The filter maintains the marginal state of every node instead of a joint state of the group, and updates the estimates using a Gibbs sampler, which is known as a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by examining 16 mobile nodes moving randomly while sharing information with neighbouring nodes in a MANET. The results show that the proposed approach facilitates the tracking of mobile nodes that do not have egocentric position information available. It also outperforms the EKF in systems with non-Gaussian properties.",

Two frequently-used representations are occupancy grid maps, which only model metric information, and object-based world models, which only model object attributes. Many tasks represent space in just one of these two ways; however, because objects must be physically grounded in metric space, these two distinct layers of representation are fundamentally linked. We develop an approach that maintains these two sources of spatial information separately, and combines them on demand. We illustrate the utility and necessity of combining such information through applying our approach to a collection of motivating examples.",

This novel force sensing device is composed of a linear retractable mechanism and a spherical visual feature. The sensor mechanism can be adapted to endoscopic cameras used in MIS. As the distance between the camera and feature varies due to the sliding joint, interaction forces with anatomical surfaces can be computed based on the visual appearance of the feature in the image. Hence, this device allows the measurement of forces without introducing new stand-alone sensors. A mathematical model was derived based on validation data tests and preliminary experiments were conducted to verify the model's accuracy. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our vision based approach.",

Stereo vision alone erroneously detects obstacles in environments with ambiguous appearance and ground plane such as in broad-acre crop fields with harvested crop residue. The novelty detector estimates the probability density in image descriptor space and incorporates image-space positional understanding to identify potential regions for obstacle detection using dense stereo matching. The results demonstrate that the system is able to detect obstacles typical to a farm at day and night.

        "abstract": "A new challenge for surgical robotics is placed in the use of flexible manipulators, to perform procedures that are impossible for currently available rigid robots. Since the surgeon only controls the end-effector of the manipulator, new control strategies need to be developed to correctly move its flexible body without damaging the surrounding environment. This paper shows how a positional controller for a new surgical robot (STIFF-FLOP) can be learnt from the demonstrations given by an expert user. The proposed algorithm exploits the variability of the task to comply with the constraints only when needed, by implementing a minimal intervention principle control strategy. The results are applied to scenarios involving movements inside a constrained environment and disturbance rejection.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "An increasing number of wearable and mobile devices are capable of automatically sensing and recording rich information about the surrounding environment. To make use of such data, it is desirable for each data point to be matched with its corresponding spatial location. We focus on using the trajectory from a device's odometry sensors that reveal changes in motion over time. Our goal is to recover the route traversed, which we will define as a sequence of revisitable positions. Dead reckoning, which computes the device's route from its odometry trajectory, is known to suffer from significant drift over time. We aim to overcome drift errors by reshaping the odometry trajectory to fit the constraints of a given topological map and sensor noise model. Prior works use iterative search algorithms that are susceptible to local maximas [15], which means that they can be misled when faced with ambiguous decisions. In contrast, our algorithm is able to find the set of all routes within the given constraints. This also reveals if there are multiple routes that are similarly likely. We can then rank them and select the optimal route that is most likely to be the actual route. We also show that the algorithm can be extended to recover routes even in the presence of topological map errors. We evaluate our algorithm by recovering all routes traversed by a wheeled robot covering over 9 kilometers from its odometry sensor data.",

It is necessary to move along a path while manipulating a tool with the whole body and applying exactly the right amount of force to successfully accomplish the task. So mastering such a challenge demands detailed knowledge about the involved objects and the underlying process models. Reasoning about an appropriate parameterization of the task is thereby essential. In this paper we propose a combination of object-centered hybrid reasoning and compliant force control to solve complex whole-body mobile manipulation issues. Depending on the objects involved in the task, an appropriate controller is selected and automatically parameterized. The methods are validated in an elaborate experiment on the humanoid robot Rollin' Justin.",

        "abstract": "Searching for objects in occluded spaces is one of the problems robots need to solve when tackling mobile manipulation tasks. Most approaches focus only on searching for a specific object. In this paper, we use the concept of relational affordances to improve occluded object search performance. Affordances define action possibilities on an object in the environment and play a role in basic cognitive capabilities. Relational affordances extend this concept by modelling relations between multiple objects. By learning and using a relational affordance model we can search for any of the multiple objects that afford a given action, each object type having a probability distribution over possible sizes and shapes, and where spatial relations between objects such as co-occurrence and stacking are modelled. The experimental results show the viability of the relational affordance models for occluded object search.",

The system can be used to generate pose graphs, do feature-based SLAM, and also includes tools for semantic mapping. Multiple measurement types from different sensors can be combined for multimodal mapping. It is open with standard interfaces to allow easy integration of new sensors and feature types. We present a detailed description of the mapping approach, as well as a software framework that implements this, and present detailed descriptions of its applications to several domains including mapping with a service robot in an indoor environment, large-scale mapping on a PackBot, and mapping with a handheld RGBD camera.",

Furthermore, we investigate the effects of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) rehabilitation method applied in our robotic system. The proposed robot-assisted system has been used in real experiments and provides PNF rehabilitation to five stroke patients for six weeks.

It is assumed that both the camera and the object are provided with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) capable of measuring their attitude with respect to the gravity and the earth magnetic vectors. Furthermore, the object is assumed to contain a feature of n points, the position of which is known in the object coordinate frame. An algorithm is proposed, which uses the image provided by the camera and the information provided by the IMUs, to solve the PnP problem, i.e., to estimate the relative pose of the object in the camera reference frame. Two special cases will be studied. The first is the case where all the attitude information given by the IMU is used. In the second case only the measurements provided by inclinometers are used, neglecting those coming from the magnetometers, because they are usually quite noisy. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is tested either by numerical simulations and by experimental tests with cameras.",

        "abstract": "Replicating the human hand capabilities is a great challenge in telemanipulation as well as in autonomous grasping and manipulation. One of the main issues is the difference between human and robotic hands in terms of kinematic structure, which does not allow a direct correlation of the joints. We recently proposed an object-based mapping algorithm able to replicate on several robotic hand models the human hand synergies. In such approach the virtual object shapes were a-priori defined (e.g. a sphere or an ellipsoid) and the transformation was represented as the composition of a rigid body motion and a scale variation. In this work, we introduce a generalization of the object-based mapping that overcomes the definition of a shape for the virtual object. We consider only a set of reference points on the hands. We estimate a homogeneous transformation matrix that represents how the human hand motion changes its reference point positions. The same transformation is then imposed to the reference points on the robotic hand and the joints values obtained through a kinematic inversion technique. The mapping approach is suitable also for telemanipulation scenarios where the hand joint motions are combined with a wrist displacement.",

The system sensor assembly consists of two downward-facing cameras and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) with three-axis accelerometers/gyroscopes. Real-time implementation of the system is enabled by a low-cost embedded system via two important features: firstly, simple pixel-level algorithms are integrated in a low-end FPGA and accelerated via pipeline and combinational logic techniques; secondly, a fast yaw-and-translation estimation algorithm works well with a novel outlier rejection scheme based on probabilistic predetermined operations rather than hypothesis testing iterations. We illustrate the performance of our system by hovering a MAV in a GPS-denied environment. Its feasibility and robustness is also illustrated in complex outdoor environments.",

        "abstract": "We present a real time algorithm for estimating the pose of non-planar objects on which we have placed a visual marker. It is designed to overcome the limitations of small aerial robots, such as slow CPUs, low image resolution and geometric distortions produced by wide angle lenses or viewpoint changes. The method initially registers the shape of a known marker to the contours extracted in an image. For this purpose, and in contrast to state-of-the art, we do not seek to match textured patches or points of interest. Instead, we optimize a geometric alignment cost computed directly from raw polygonal representations of the observed regions using very simple and efficient clipping algorithms. Further speed is achieved by performing the optimization in the polygon representation space, avoiding the need of 2D image processing operations. Deformation modes are easily included in the optimization scheme, allowing an accurate registration of different markers attached to curved surfaces using a single deformable prototype. Once this initial registration is solved, the object pose is retrieved using a standard PnP approach. As a result, the method achieves accurate object pose estimation in real-time, which is very important for interactive UAV tasks, for example for short distance surveillance or bar assembly. We present experiments where our method yields, at about 30Hz, an average error of less than 5mm in estimating the position of a 19\u00d719mm marker placed at 0.7m of the camera.",

In this paper we propose an approach for altering existing robot behaviors online, where a human coach interactively changes the robot motion to achieve the desired outcome. Using hand gestures, the human coach can specify the desired modifications to the previously acquired behavior. To preserve a natural posture while performing the task, the movement is encoded in the robot's joint space using periodic dynamic movement primitives. The coaching gestures are mapped to the robot joint space via robot Jacobian and used to create a virtual force field affecting the movement. A recursive least squares technique is used to modify the existing movement with respect to the virtual force field. The proposed approach was evaluated on a simulated three degrees of freedom planar robot and on a real humanoid robot, where human coaching gestures were captured by an RGB-D sensor. Although our focus was on rhythmic movements, the developed approach is also applicable to discrete (point-to-point) movements.",

Computer vision tasks must handle situations where unknown objects appear and must detect and track some object which is not in the trained database. In such cases, the system must learn or, otherwise derive, descriptions of new objects. In this paper, we investigate creating a representation of previously unknown objects that newly appear in the scene. The representation creates a viewpoint-invariant and scale-normalized model approximately describing an unknown object with multimodal sensors. Those properties of the representation facilitate 3D tracking of the object using 2D-to-2D image matching. The representation has both benefits of an implicit model (referred to as a view-based model) and an explicit model (referred to as a shape-based model). Experimental results demonstrate the viability of the proposed representation and outperform the existing approaches for 3D-pose estimation.",

        "abstract": "One of the big challenges for robots working outside of traditional industrial settings is the ability to robustly and flexibly grasp and manipulate tools for various tasks. When a tool is interacting with another object during task execution, several problems arise: a tool can be partially or completely occluded from the robot's view, it can slip or shift in the robot's hand \u2014 thus, the robot may lose the information about the exact position of the tool in the hand. Thus, there is a need for online calibration and/or recalibration of the tool. In this paper, we present a model-free online tool-tip calibration method that uses force/torque measurements and an adaptive estimation scheme to estimate the point of contact between a tool and the environment. An adaptive force control component guarantees that interaction forces are limited even before the contact point estimate has converged. We also show how to simultaneously estimate the location and normal direction of the surface being touched by the tool-tip as the contact point is estimated. The stability of the the overall scheme and the convergence of the estimated parameters are theoretically proven and the performance is evaluated in experiments on a real robot.",

        "abstract": "We investigate methods to improve fault-tolerance of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to increase their reliability and persistent autonomy. We propose a learning-based approach that is able to discover new control policies to overcome thruster failures as they happen. The proposed approach is a model-based direct policy search that learns on an on-board simulated model of the AUV. The model is adapted to a new condition when a fault is detected and isolated. Since the approach generates an optimal trajectory, the learned fault-tolerant policy is able to navigate the AUV towards a specified target with minimum cost. Finally, the learned policy is executed on the real robot in a closed-loop using the state feedback of the AUV. Unlike most existing methods which rely on the redundancy of thrusters, our approach is also applicable when the AUV becomes under-actuated in the presence of a fault. To validate the feasibility and efficiency of the presented approach, we evaluate it with three learning algorithms and three policy representations with increasing complexity. The proposed method is tested on a real AUV, Girona500.",

We address the problem of online feature learning by proposing Convolutional Max-Pooling (CMP), a simple feed-forward two-layer network derived from the deep hierarchical Max-Pooling Convolutional Neural Network (MPCNN). To learn and classify gestures in an online and incremental fashion, we employ a 2nd order online learning method, namely the Soft-Confidence Weighted (SCW) learning scheme. In order for all robots to collectively take part in the learning and recognition task and obtain a swarm-level classification, we build a distributed consensus by fusing the individual decision opinions of robots together with the individual weights generated from multiple classifiers. Accuracy, robustness, and scalability of obtained solutions have been verified through emulation experiments performed on a large data set of real data acquired by a networked swarm of robots.",

Alternative ways to navigate around the obstacles typically correspond to different local minima in the cost function. In this paper we present a highly effective approach to overcome such local minima and to quickly propose a set of alternative, topologically different and optimized paths. We furthermore describe how to maintain a set of optimized trajectory alternatives to reduce optimization efforts when the robot has to adapt to changes in the environment. We demonstrate in experiments that our method outperforms a state-of-the-art approach by an order of magnitude in computation time, which allows a robot to use our method online during navigation. We furthermore demonstrate that the approach of using a set of qualitatively different trajectories is beneficial in shared autonomy settings, where a user operating a wheelchair can quickly switch between topologically different trajectories.",

Two aspects are essential for a successful walking imitation: stable footprints represented in task space and motion similarity represented in joint space. The human footprints are recognized from the captured motion data and imitated by the robot through conventional zero-moment point (ZMP) control scheme. Additionally we focus on similar knee joint trajectories for the motion similarity, which are related to knee stretching and swing leg motion. The inverse kinematics suffers from three problems: knee singularity, strongly conflicting tasks and underactuation. We formulate this problem as a quadratic programming (QP) with dynamic equality and inequality constraints. The discontinuity of dynamic task switching is solved by introducing an activation buffer, resulting in a cascaded QP form. Finally we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the DLR humanoid robot TORO.",

        "abstract": "Methods to accurately capture the motion of humans in motion capture systems from optical markers are important for a large variety of applications including animation, interaction, orthopedics, and rehabilitation. Major challenges in this context are to associate the observed markers with skeleton segments, to track markers between consecutive frames, and to estimate the underlying skeleton configuration for each frame. Existing solutions to this problem often assume fully labeled markers, which usually requires labor-intensive manual labeling, especially when markers are temporally occluded during the movements. In this paper, we propose a fully automated method to initialize and track the skeleton configuration of humans from optical motion capture data without the need of any user intervention. Our method applies a flexible T-pose-based initialization that works with a wide range of marker placements, robustly estimates the skeleton configuration through least-squares optimization, and exploits the skeleton structure for fully automatic marker labeling. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach for online skeleton tracking and show that our method outperforms solutions that are widely used and considered as state of the art.",

        "abstract": "An accurate dynamics model of a robot is an important ingredient of many algorithms used to solve robotics problems, including motion planning, control, localization, and mapping. Models derived from first principles often contain parameters (e.g. mass, moment of inertia, arm lengths, etc.) for which values are unknown. Those which cannot be easily measured must be estimated from the observed behavior of the robot. A good approach to address this problem is to plan control policies for the robot that elicit maximal amounts of information about the parameters of the system, while still achieving other objectives specified for the robot. In case of parameters subject to drift, this must be done continuously over the lifetime of the robot if costly re-calibrations are to be avoided. In this paper, we introduce a new method that formulates the parameter estimation problem as a continuous partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which plans control policies that optimally trade-off the effort spent on learning parameters and effort spent on achieving regular robot objectives (exploration vs. exploitation), and allow for online, continual parameter estimation. While POMDPs have, until recently, been mostly of theoretical interest due to their inherent complexity, we build on recent advances that allow continuous, Gaussian POMDPs to be approximately-optimally solved in near-real-time rates. We show that the computed control policies lead to improved convergence of the belief of the parameters compared to system identification approaches based on applying random controls.",

        "abstract": "In the high precision robotic assembly processes, the process parameters have to be tuned in order to adapt to variations and satisfy the performance requirements. However, because of the modeling difficulty and low efficiency of the existing solutions, this task is usually performed offline. In this paper, an online parameter optimization method is developed. Gaussian Process Regression(GPR) is utilized to model the relationship between the process parameters and system performance. The GPR surrogated Bayesian Optimization Algorithm(GPRBOA) is proposed to optimize the process parameters. To reduce the risk of converging to a local minimum, a random variation factor is added to the Lower Confidence Bound(LCB) acquisition function to balance the exploration and exploitation processes. To deal with the computational burden of GPR, a switching criterion is proposed to coordinate the optimization process and production process to reduce the computational complexity. Experiments were performed using a peg-in-hole process. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy compared to Design Of Experiment(DOE) methods. The proposed method is the first attempt of model-driven assembly process parameter optimization and will generate big economic impact.",

We introduce an auction-based scheduling algorithm which plans to transfer items between robots to make deliveries more efficiently. The algorithm can obey either hard or soft time constraints. We discuss how to replan in response to newly requested items, cancelled requests, delayed robots, and robot failures.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for the continuous segmentation of dynamic objects using only a vehicle mounted monocular camera without any prior knowledge of the object's appearance. Prior work in online static/dynamic segmentation [1] is extended to identify multiple instances of dynamic objects by introducing an unsupervised motion clustering step. These clusters are then used to update a multi-class classifier within a self-supervised framework. In contrast to many tracking-by-detection based methods, our system is able to detect dynamic objects without any prior knowledge of their visual appearance shape or location. Furthermore, the classifier is used to propagate labels of the same object in previous frames, which facilitates the continuous tracking of individual objects based on motion. The proposed system is evaluated using recall and false alarm metrics in addition to a new multi-instance labelled dataset to measure the performance of segmenting multiple instances of objects.",

        "abstract": "Ultrasound imaging can be an advantageous imaging modality for image guided surgery. When using ultrasound imaging (or any imaging modality), calibration is important when more advanced forms of guidance, such as augmented reality systems, are used. There are many different methods of calibration, but the goal of each is to recover the rigid body transformation relating the pose of the probe to the ultrasound image frame. This paper presents a unified algorithm that can solve the ultrasound calibration problem for various calibration methodologies. The algorithm uses gradient descent optimization on the Euclidean Group. It can be used in real time, also serving as a way to update the calibration parameters on-line. We also show how filtering, based on the theory of invariants, can further improve the online results. Focusing on two specific calibration methodologies, the AX = XB problem and the BX-1p problem, we demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm in both simulation and experimentation.",

        "abstract": "Most conventional robotic arms depend on sensory feedback to perform their tasks. When feedback is inaccurate, slow or otherwise unreliable, robots should behave more like humans: rely on feedforward instead. This paper presents an approach to perform repetitive tasks with robotic arms, without the need for feedback (i.e. the control is open loop). The cyclic motions of the repetitive tasks are analyzed using an approach similar to limit cycle theory. We optimize open loop control signals that result in open loop stable motions. This approach to manipulator control was implemented on a two DOF arm in the horizontal plane with a spring on the first DOF, of which we show simulation and hardware results. The results show that both in simulation and in hardware experiments, it is possible to create open loop stable cycles. However, the two resulting cycles are different due to model inaccuracies. We also show simulation and hardware results for an inverted pendulum, of which we have a more accurate model. These results show stable cycles that are the same in simulation and hardware experiments.",

        "abstract": "OpenGV is a new C++ library for calibrated realtime 3D geometric vision. It unifies both central and non-central absolute and relative camera pose computation algorithms within a single library. Each problem type comes with minimal and non-minimal closed-form solvers, as well as non-linear iterative optimization and robust sample consensus methods. OpenGV therefore contains an unprecedented level of completeness with regard to calibrated geometric vision algorithms, and it is the first library with a dedicated focus on a unified real-time usage of non-central multi-camera systems, which are increasingly popular in robotics and in the automotive industry. This paper introduces OpenGV's flexible interface and abstraction for multi-camera systems, and outlines the performance of all contained algorithms. It is our hope that the introduction of this open-source platform will motivate people to use it and potentially also include more algorithms, which would further contribute to the general accessibility of geometric vision algorithms, and build a common playground for the fair comparison of different solutions.",

In particular, we consider using Pneumatic Artificial Muscle (PAM) as a part of Pneumatic-Electric (PE) hybrid actuation system. An optimal control framework can be useful for PE hybrid system to properly distribute desired torque outputs to the actuators that have different characteristics. In the optimal control framework, the standard choice to represent control cost is squared force or torque outputs. However, since the control input for PAM is pressure rather than the force or the torque, we should explicitly consider the pressure of PAM as the control cost in an objective function of the optimal control method. We show that we are able to use pressure input as the control cost for PAM by explicitly considering the model which represents a relationship between the pressure input and the force output of PAM. We demonstrate that one-DOF robot with the PE hybrid actuation system can generate pressure-optimized ball throwing movements by using the optimal control method.",

The design problems of the CDPRs at hand are formulated as optimization problems. They aim at determining the locations of the base anchor points of the cables that minimize the size of the CDPR, while satisfying a set of constraints. Those constraints guarantee that the moving platform can support the external wrenches and that there is no interference between the cables and between the cables and the environment, all along the path to be followed by the moving platform.",

With a timed Petri net model, the scheduling problem is reduced to determine the waiting time of robots. Then, the conditions are presented, under which a one-wafer periodic schedule exists such that the lower bound of cycle time can be reached.

Medical procedures such as ventriculostomy can benefit greatly from real-time feedback of the inserted catheter tip. While the effects of the number of sensors on the localization accuracy in such systems has been reported, the spatial design of the sensor layout has been largely overlooked. Here in this paper, a framework for determining an optimal sensor assembly for enhanced localization performance is presented and investigated through numerical simulations and direct experiments. Two approaches are presented: one based on structured grid configuration and the other derived using Genetic Algorithms. Simulation results verified by experiments strongly suggest that the layout of the sensors not only has an effect on the localization accuracy, but also has an effect far more pronounced than improvements brought by increasing the number of sensors.",

Workspace is one of the most important quality criteria for positioning devices. Given a lot of literature on workspace optimization of rigid body parallel robots, there is relatively less work done in their compliant counterparts due to the challenges in determining the workspace. In this paper, we present an analytical formulation and a search algorithm to determine the workspace of the flexure based parallel mechanisms. A novel adaptive genetic algorithm has been developed to conduct the single and bi-objective optimization for maximum translational and rotational workspace. These optimization results provide a guidance for the designer to improve the device for specific design requirements.",

We use linear temporal logic (LTL) to specify a wide range of properties and tasks, such as safety, progress, response, surveillance, repeated assembly, and environmental monitoring. Our method directly encodes an LTL formula as mixed-integer linear constraints on the continuous system variables, avoiding the computationally expensive processes of creating a finite abstraction of the system and a B\u00fcchi automaton for the specification. In numerical experiments, we solve temporal logic motion planning tasks for high-dimensional (10+ continuous state) dynamical systems.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Robot control requires the rapid computation of robot shape, which for continuum robots typically involves solving complex mechanics-based models. Furthermore, shape computation based on kinematic input variables can be inaccurate due to parameter errors and model simplification. An alternate approach is to compute the shape in real-time from a set of sensors positioned along the length of the robot that provide measurements of local curvature, e.g., optical fiber Bragg gratings. This paper proposes a general framework for selecting the number and placement of such sensors with respect to arclength so as to compute the forward kinematic solution accurately and quickly. The approach is based on defining numerically-efficient shape reconstruction models parameterized by sensor number and location. Optimization techniques are used to find the sensor locations that minimize shape and tip error between a reconstruction model and a mechanics-based model. As a specific example, several reconstruction models are proposed and compared for concentric tube robots. These results indicate that the choice of reconstruction model as well as sensor placement can have a substantial effect on robot shape estimation.",

        "abstract": "Occupancy grids have been a popular mapping technique in mobile robotics for nearly 30 years. Occupancy grids offer a discrete representation of the world and seek to determine the occupancy probability of each cell. Traditional occupancy grid mapping methods make two assumptions for computational efficiency and it has been shown that the full posterior is computationally intractable for real-world mapping applications without these assumptions. The two assumptions result in tuning parameters that control the information gained from each distance measurement. In this paper, several tuning parameters found in the literature are optimized against the full posterior in 1D. In addition, this paper presents a new parameterization of the update function that outperforms existing methods in terms of capturing residual uncertainty. Capturing the residual uncertainty better estimates the position of obstacles and prevents under- and over-confidence in both the occupied and unoccupied cells. The paper concludes by showing that the new update function better captures the residual uncertainty in each cell when compared to an offline mapping method for realistic 2D simulations.",

They can be used to represent point-to-point and periodic movements and can be applied in Cartesian or in joint space. One problem that arises when DMPs are used to define control policies in Cartesian space is that there exists no minimal, singularity-free representation of orientation. In this paper we show how dynamic movement primitives can be defined for non minimal, singularity free representations of orientation, such as rotation matrices and quaternions. All of the advantages of DMPs, including ease of learning, the ability to include coupling terms, and scale and temporal invariance, can be adopted in our formulation. We have also proposed a new phase stopping mechanism to ensure full movement reproduction in case of perturbations.",

Compared to point features used in most existing place recognition methods, line features are easily found in man-made environments and more robust to environmental changes such as illumination, viewing direction, or occlusion because they are more likely to be extracted from structures. Candidate matches are found using a vocabulary tree and their geometric consistency is verified by a motion estimation algorithm using line segments. The proposed algorithm operates in real-time, and it is tested with a challenging real-world dataset with more than 10,000 database images acquired in urban driving scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Typically, random sample consensus (RANSAC) approaches are used to perform outlier rejection for visual odometry, however the use of RANSAC can be computationally expensive. The parity space approach (PSA) provides methodology to perform computationally efficient consistency checks for observations, without having to explicitly compute the system state. This work presents two outlier based rejection techniques, Group Parity Outlier Rejection and Parity Initialized RANSAC, which use the parity space approach to perform rapid outlier rejection. Experiments demonstrate the proposed approaches are able to compute solutions with increased accuracy and improved run-time when compared to RANSAC.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the perception and reasoning task of answering queries about realistic scenes with objects of daily use perceived by a robot. A key problem implied by the task is the variety of perceivable properties of objects, such as their shape, texture, color, size, text pieces and logos, that go beyond the capabilities of individual state-of-the-art perception methods. A promising alternative is to employ combinations of more specialized perception methods. In this paper we propose a novel combination method, which structures perception in a two-step process, and apply this method in our object perception system. In a first step, specialized methods annotate detected object hypotheses with symbolic information pieces. In the second step, the given query Q is answered by inferring the conditional probability P(Q | E), where E are the symbolic information pieces considered as evidence for the conditional probability. In this setting Q and E are part of a probabilistic model of scenes, objects and their annotations, which the perception method has beforehand learned a joint probability distribution of. Our proposed method has substantial advantages over alternative methods in terms of the generality of queries that can be answered, the generation of information that can actively guide perception, the ease of extension, the possibility of including additional kinds of evidences, and its potential for the realization of self-improving and \u2014 specializing perception systems. We show for object categorization, which is a subclass of the probabilistic inferences, that impressive categorization performance can be achieved combining the employed expert perception methods in a synergistic manner.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel efficient sampling bias technique to improve the performance of a task space trajectory planner for hyper-redundant manipulators. We defines productive regions in the task space as a set of states that can lead effectively to a goal state. We first compute a maximum reachable area (MRA) where a robot can reach from the node by an employed local planner for a node in the task space. When the MRA of a node contains the goal state, we call it promising and bias our sampling to cover promising MRAs. When the MRA does not contain the goal state, we call it unpromising and construct a detour sampling domain for detouring operations from obstacles constraining the manipulator. The union of promising MRAs and detour sampling domains approximates our productive regions, and we bias our sampling to cover these domains more. We have applied our Productive Regions Oriented Task space planner (PROT) to various types of robots in R2 task space and achieved up to 3.54 times improvement over the state-of-the-art task space planner. We have additionally verified the benefits of our method by applying it to cabled mobile robot planning.",

A steady state model is developed for motors, propellers, electronic speed controllers (ESC), and batteries, using a simplified analysis. Based on technical specifications of batteries, motors and ESCs, component functional parameters are expressed as a function of an equivalent length. Propeller models are developed using experimental data. An optimization program is developed, which calculates the optimal design vector, employing as objective function the energy consumption or the vehicle diameter. Using this program, the influence of the payload and of the number of rotors on the design vector and the MRAV size is studied. The results obtained by the program were compared successfully to existing commercial MRAVs.",

This paper investigates 2D motion-planning complexity for large swarms of simple mobile robots (such as bacteria, sensors, or smart building material). In previous work we proved it is NP-hard to decide whether a given initial configuration can be transformed into a desired target configuration; in this paper we prove a stronger result: the problem of finding an optimal control sequence is PSPACE-complete. On the positive side, we show we can build useful systems by designing obstacles. We present a reconfigurable hardware platform and demonstrate how to form arbitrary permutations and build a compact absolute encoder. We then take the same platform and use dual-rail logic to build a universal logic gate that concurrently evaluates AND, NAND, NOR and OR operations. Using many of these gates and appropriate interconnects we can evaluate any logical expression.",

We propose a flyer with only two moving parts (a rotor and a stator) and a single actuator that is capable of hovering flight without active attitude control. The passive stability is analyzed and reduced to two mechanisms that are a function of the relative offset of the center of pressure and center of mass, the angular momentum of rotor and stator and the differential lift of the spinning elements. The design space over these parameters is explored with a dozen models that are unstable and one that is stable. Interestingly, the two stability mechanisms are not compatible requiring opposing design emphasis. Passive stability of this model is verified by Routh Hurwitz criterion, in simulation and a physical prototype. The vehicle has the added benefits of low complexity and favorable size scaling compared to other MAVs. The vehicle design guidelines derived from both theory and experimentation are presented.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of planning the motion of a mobile robot with a limited sensory field-of-view in an unknown dynamic environment. In such a situation, the upper-bounded planning time prevents from computing a complete motion to the goal, partial motion planning is in order. Besides the presence of moving obstacles whose future behaviour is unknown precludes absolute motion safety (in the sense that no collision will ever take place whatever happens) is impossible to guarantee. The stance taken herein is to settle for a weaker level of motion safety called passive motion safety: it guarantees that, if a collision takes place, the robot will be at rest. The primary contribution of this paper is PassPMP, a partial motion planner enforcing passive motion safety. PassPMP periodically computes a passively safe partial trajectory designed to drive the robot towards its goal state. Passive motion safety is handled using a variant of the Inevitable Collision State (ICS) concept called Braking ICS, i.e. states such that, whatever the future braking trajectory of the robot, a collision occurs before it is at rest. Simulation results demonstrate how PassPMP operates and handles limited sensory field-of-views, occlusions and moving obstacles with unknown future behaviour. More importantly, PassPMP is provably passively safe.",

A local controller is developed to transform the robot dynamics so that the robot is passive with respect to an output signal containing position and velocity information. With the utilization of scattering transformation and a passive remote controller (for position regulation), the interconnected robotic system is passive and stable under time delay. Subsequently, we develop a packet management, called Wave-Variable Modulation (WVM), to deal with the proposed networked robotic system under packet loss. The passivity of the communication network can be preserved, and the performance of position regulation is guaranteed by using WVM. Simulations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed control architecture.",

We adopt a topological approach along with graph search-based techniques to solve this problem, wherein we use the notion of a homotopy augmented graph to capture the information about the homotopy class of the cable. This lets us plan traversable optimal trajectories from an initial robot position and cable configuration to a final position of the robot. We demonstrate the algorithm by planning trajectories in several cluttered environments and with different cable lengths. As a demonstration of practical applicability, using a dynamic simulation testbed we simulate a robot-cable system following a planned trajectory.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of group path planning while maintaining group coherence and persistence. Group coherence ensures that a group minimizes both longitudinal and lateral dispersion, and is achieved with the introduction of a deformation penalty to the cost formulation. When the deformation penalty is significantly high, a group may split and later merge. Group persistence is modeled by introducing split and merge actions in the action space, and adding a split penalty to the cost measure. We formulate the problem domain (state, action space, and cost formulation), present our path planning approach for coherent and persistent groups, and provide empirical results demonstrating the capabilities of our method on a variety of challenging scenarios.",

We use a path planning approach which shares many similarities with the results of the DARPA Learning Locomotion challenge and extend it to allow more flexibility and increased robustness. During execution we incorporate an on-line force-based foothold adaptation mechanism that updates the planned motion according to the perceived state of the environment. This way we exploit the active compliance of our system to smoothly interact with the environment, even when this is inaccurately perceived or dynamically changing, and update the planned path on-the-fly. In tandem we use a virtual model controller that provides the feed-forward torques that allow increased accuracy together with highly compliant behaviour on an otherwise naturally very stiff robotic system. We leverage the full set of benefits that a high performance torque controlled quadruped robot can provide and demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of our approach on a set of experimental trials of increasing difficulty.",

Following the growing availability of thermal cameras and the distinctive thermal signature of humans, research effort has been focusing on developing people detection and tracking methodologies applicable to this sensing modality. However, a plethora of challenges arise on the transition from visible-light to thermal images, especially with the recent trend of employing thermal cameras onboard aerial platforms (e.g. in search-and-rescue research) capturing oblique views of the scenery. This paper presents a new, publicly available dataset of annotated thermal image sequences, posing a multitude of challenges for people detection and tracking. Moreover, we propose a new particle filter based framework for tracking people in aerial thermal images. Finally, we evaluate the performance of this pipeline on our dataset, incorporating a selection of relevant, state-of-the-art methods and present a comprehensive discussion of the merits spawning from our study.",

Merging these two modes of movement is achieved via a mechanism utilizing an opposed grip with directional adhesives. Critical design considerations include (a) climbing mechanism weight constraints, (b) suitable body geometry for climbing and (c) effects of impact dynamics. The robot uses a symmetric linkage and cam mechanism to load and detach the feet while climbing. The lengths of key parameters, including the distances between each the feet and the tail, are chosen based on the ratio of required preload force and detachment force for the adhesive mechanism.",

BTs are a recent alternative to Finite State Machines (FSMs), for doing modular task switching in robot control architectures. By encoding the switching logic in a tree structure, instead of distributing it in the states of a FSM, modularity and reusability are improved. In this paper, we compute performance measures, such as success/failure probabilities and execution times, for plans encoded and executed by BTs. To do this, we first introduce Stochastic Behavior Trees (SBT), where we assume that the probabilistic performance measures of the basic action controllers are given. We then show how Discrete Time Markov Chains (DTMC) can be used to aggregate these measures from one level of the tree to the next. The recursive structure of the tree then enables us to step by step propagate such estimates from the leaves (basic action controllers) to the root (complete task execution). Finally, we verify our analytical results using massive Monte Carlo simulations, and provide an illustrative example of the results for a complex robotic task.",

        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with a novel mobile sensor scheduling problem, involving a single robot tasked with monitoring several events of interest that occur at different locations. Of particular interest is the monitoring of events that can not be easily forecast. Prominent examples range from natural phenomena (e.g., monitoring abnormal seismic activity around a volcano using a ground robot) to urban activities (e.g., monitoring early formations of traffic congestion in the Boston area using an aerial robot). Motivated by these examples, this paper focuses on problems where the precise occurrence time of the events is not known a priori, but some statistics for their inter-arrival times are available from past observations. The robot's task is to monitor the events to optimize the following two objectives: (i) maximize the number of events observed and (ii) minimize the delay between two consecutive observations of events occurring at the same location. Provided with only one robot, it is crucial to optimize these objectives in a balanced way, so that they are optimized at each station simultaneously. Our main theoretical result is that this complex mobile sensor scheduling problem can be reduced to a quasi-convex program, which can be solved in polynomial time. In other words, a globally optimal solution can be computed in time that is polynomial in the number of locations. We also provide computational experiments that validate our theoretical results.",

        "abstract": "Various robots are being developed to support active human lifestyles throughout the world. In particular, robots that can support a comfortable lifestyle for elderly people are needed for the coming super-aging society in many countries. The authors have already proposed the Personal Robot (PR) shown in Fig. 1, which can follow a human being and carry their baggage; the PR user does not need to carry heavy bags, even after shopping. The PR, therefore, can encourage not only elderly people but also young people to walk outside. This means that the PR can support a life of wellness in the true sense. In conventional research, a control approach for the roll angle is proposed to ensure the stability margin for steady turning because in order to follow a human being, the PR must realize high traveling performance. In this paper, a method of reference generation for the roll angle and turning angular velocity is proposed to take into account the stability margin during the transient state using model predictive control. According to the proposed approach, the quickest turning motion can be realized by keeping the upper and lower boundary constraints for the zero moment point (ZMP). The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by experiment using the prototype PR.",

A novel control scheme is proposed for modulating the clutch friction torque in this particular class of compliant actuators to make the robot operate in \u201cRigid mode\u201d when it does not interact with the environment to achieve high accuracy, bandwidth and controllability; meanwhile ensuring that the robot maximum static force is constrained to a maximum threshold permitting flexible reactions in potentially risky scenarios. The robot autonomously switches to \u201cCompliant mode\u201d (clutches off) when it interacts with external agents to exploit the advantages of compliance during contacts. Experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of proposed approach in improving the robot performance (tracking accuracy) while still guaranteeing an interaction-friendly behavior when contact occurs.",

        "abstract": "We present an approach for autonomous interactive object segmentation by a humanoid robot. The visual segmentation of unknown objects in a complex scene is an important prerequisite for e.g. object learning or grasping, but extremely difficult to achieve through passive observation only. Our approach uses the manipulative capabilities of humanoid robots to induce motion on the object and thus integrates the robots manipulation and sensing capabilities to segment previously unknown objects. We show that this is possible without any human guidance or pre-programmed knowledge, and that the resulting motion allows for reliable and complete segmentation of new objects in an unknown and cluttered environment. We extend our previous work, which was restricted to textured objects, by devising new methods for the generation of object hypotheses and the estimation of their motion after being pushed by the robot. These methods are mainly based on the analysis of motion of color annotated 3D points obtained from stereo vision, and allow the segmentation of textured as well as non-textured rigid objects. In order to evaluate the quality of the obtained segmentations, they are used to train a simple object recognizer. The approach has been implemented and tested on the humanoid robot ARMAR-III, and the experimental results confirm its applicability on a wide variety of objects even in highly cluttered scenes.",

Such an automated planner needs to generate collision-free coverage paths by steering waypoints to locations that both minimize the path length and maximize the amount of information gathered along the path. The approach presented in this paper significantly extends prior work and handles motion uncertainty of an unmanned vehicle and the presence of obstacles by using a Markov Decision Process based approach to generate collision-free paths. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is robust to significant motion uncertainties and reduces the probability of collision with obstacles in the environment.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a simple strategy for a robot hand to grasp and lift a deformable 3D object resting on a table. Inspired by the human hand grasping, the strategy employs two rigid hemispherical fingers to first squeeze the object until a secure grip is achieved under contact friction, and then translate vertically upward. During the squeeze, a lift test is repeatedly conducted to determine if the maximum hypothetical liftable weight of the object reaches its real weight. Actual lifting follows when the test is passed. The object's deformation and configuration of contact with the fingers and the plane are tracked using the finite element method (FEM) in an event-driven manner, based on varying contact displacements induced by the finger movements. The gravitational force acting on the object is accounted for. Slips inside the contact regions are determined from solving quadratic systems. Experiment has been conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy for this sensorless grasping approach.",

This vehicle has previously demonstrated controlled flight maneuvers, but this required an array of external cameras to precisely track its trajectory. Developing flight-worthy sensors to eliminate the need for external motion capture is an area of active study. In this paper, we consider an onboard analog magnetometer. We show that the sensor meets the size, weight, and power requirements for the RoboBee and can provide feedback on angular position for pitch and yaw angle control. We show that this sensor can provide an accurate angle reading despite proximity to the piezoelectric actuators of this vehicle. This is likely because the actuators are driven by electrostatic forces rather than the electromagnetic forces that drive the electric motors of larger aircraft. This sensor provided sufficient bandwidth to enable rapid pitch angle maneuvers within 200ms on a RoboBee constrained to rotate only about its pitch axis. We also show it operating in a feedback loop to control heading angle, the first demonstration of controlling yaw orientation at this scale.",

Due to the physics involved in scaling down conventional motors, such robots frequently require novel approaches to actuation. Actuation can have a very significant effect on robot performance, particularly at small scales where locomotion becomes energetically expensive; however, existing options for small-scale actuation are quite limited. We present a mesoscale voice coil actuator (VCA) with favorable scaling characteristics and a design that minimizes costly frictional effects at small scales while allowing fast, linear, high-displacement motion. The VCA is fabricated using planar manufacturing techniques, making it well-suited for integration into a number of mesoscale robotic platforms and for mass production. The designed VCA has a mass of 310mg, maximum force of 11.8mN, bandwidth of 51Hz, and a stroke of 4mm.",

In this work, we present a motion planning technique using sequential convex optimization for computing locally optimal, curvature-constrained trajectories to desired targets while avoiding obstacles in 3D environments. We report two main contributions in this work: (i) curvature-constrained trajectory optimization in 6D pose (position and orientation) space, and (ii) planning multiple trajectories that are mutually collision-free. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on two clinically motivated applications. Our experiments indicate that our approach can compute high-quality plans for medical needle steering in 1.6 seconds on a commodity PC, enabling re-planning during execution to correct for perturbations. Our approach can also be used for designing optimized channel layouts within 3D printed implants for intracavitary brachytherapy.",

        "abstract": "This work investigates the problem of planning under uncertainty, with application to mobile robotics. We propose a probabilistic framework in which the robot bases its decisions on the generalized belief, which is a probabilistic description of its own state and of external variables of interest. The approach naturally leads to a dual-layer architecture: an inner estimation layer, which performs inference to predict the outcome of possible decisions, and an outer decisional layer which is in charge of deciding the best action to undertake. The approach does not discretize the state or control space, and allows planning in continuous domain. Moreover, it allows to relax the assumption of maximum likelihood observations: predicted measurements are treated as random variables and are not considered as given. Experimental results show that our planning approach produces smooth trajectories while maintaining uncertainty within reasonable bounds.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a pneumatic gripper that allows gripping of the human body aimed for the transfer support, whether the body is lying down or leaning against the back support on the chair. To grip the body safely and comfortably under any conditions, two functions are newly introduced. One of them is \u201cshape adaptive joints\u201d which enable every gripping force to be equally distributed at each contact point regardless of body shape. The other is \u201cslip in tip\u201d which helps to reduce both the risk of injury and the uncomfortable friction between the body and the gripper, realized by a new pneumatic actuator to draw out the inner chambers without rubbing against the contact surface. It allows to bend following to the body shape and can also retract the chamber to release the patient safely. The validity of these functions are verified by a developed prototype called \u201cBig-hand\u201d, and its effectiveness for the transfer support is experimentally confirmed by lifting a mannequin and a human being.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In many complex robot applications, such as grasping and manipulation, it is difficult to program desired task solutions beforehand, as robots are within an uncertain and dynamic environment. In such cases, learning tasks from experience can be a useful alternative. To obtain a sound learning and generalization performance, machine learning, especially, reinforcement learning, usually requires sufficient data. However, in cases where only little data is available for learning, due to system constraints and practical issues, reinforcement learning can act suboptimally. In this paper, we investigate how model-based reinforcement learning, in particular the probabilistic inference for learning control method (Pilco), can be tailored to cope with the case of sparse data to speed up learning. The basic idea is to include further prior knowledge into the learning process. As Pilco is built on the probabilistic Gaussian processes framework, additional system knowledge can be incorporated by defining appropriate prior distributions, e.g. a linear mean Gaussian prior. The resulting Pilco formulation remains in closed form and analytically tractable. The proposed approach is evaluated in simulation as well as on a physical robot, the Festo Robotino XT. For the robot evaluation, we employ the approach for learning an object pick-up task. The results show that by including prior knowledge, policy learning can be sped up in presence of sparse data.",

The standard formulation does not take into account self-occlusions caused by a person or an object within the environment. Obtaining good views of an object from all orientations is important for surveillance and visual tracking applications. We study the art gallery problem under a constraint, termed \u0394-guarding, that ensures that all sides of any convex object are always visible in spite of self-occlusion. Our contributions in this paper are two-fold: we first prove that \u03a9(\u221an) guards are always necessary for \u0394-guarding the interior of a simple polygon having n vertices. Next, we study the problem of \u0394-guarding a set of line segments connecting points on the boundary of the polygon. This is motivated by applications where an object or person of interest can only move along certain paths in the polygon. We present a constant factor approximation algorithm for this problem - one of the few such results for art gallery problems.",

        "abstract": "Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) enables non-invasive visual inspection of the patients' digestive tract. However, the huge number of images from the WCE has been a hurdle for doctors to handle and thus it is urgent to develop computer-aided diagnosis systems to identify problematic images. To tackle this problem, an innovative algorithm based on the integration of the Bag of Features (BoF) method and the saliency map is proposed to detect polyps from the WCE images in this study. The algorithm constitutes of four steps. In the first step, by applying the BoF method, the visual words of all images are calculated by inputting the extracted Scale Invariant Feature Transformation (SIFT) feature vectors to the K-means clustering procedure. Then we calculate the saliency and non-saliency maps of the WCE images. Following that, the histogram of the visual words of each image is calculated by integrating histograms in both saliency and non-saliency maps with various weights to represent the WCE image. Finally, polyp classification of the WCE images is conducted by Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Experiments on 436 polyp images and 436 normal images are carried out to validate the proposed algorithm. The proposed method with the weight 0.9 on the saliency region achieves a best polyp detection accuracy of 92%, sensitivity of 87.9% and specificity of 93%, demonstrating that the proposed method provides a good characterization and description for polyp classification.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with the problem of pose estimation (i.e., estimating position and orientation of an moving target) for real-time visual servoing, where the vision hardware is assumed to have severely limited measurement capability. In other words, we aim to compensate the slow sensor dynamics in industrial machine vision systems. The common approach is to predict the present target motion by propagating the delayed estimates with the target dynamics. Such method is sometimes problematic since the target motion characteristics (i.e., target dynamics) may change from one visual servoing task to another. Therefore, this paper presents a method which is able to estimate the target pose as well as learn the target dynamics. We apply the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to simultaneously solve the pose estimation problem and the target dynamics modeling problem. Several techniques including the extended Kalman filter/smoother, the block coordinate descent method, and the convex optimization method are utilized to address this problem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated experimentally on a 6-DOF industrial robot.",

        "abstract": "The design and development of the pose tracking system for an autonomous mobile robot and the time consuming calibration of its intrinsic sensor parameters (e.g., displacement, misalignment and iron distortions of an inertial measurement unit) are one of the preliminary requirements of any project involving a mobile robot platform. This paper introduces ROAMFREE, a turn-on-and-go multiple sensors pose tracking and self-calibration framework adaptable to different mobile robot platforms (e.g., Ackerman steering vehicles, quadrotor aerial vehicles, omnidirectional mobile robots). We formulate the sensor fusion problem as a Gauss-Newton optimization on an hyper-graph where nodes represent poses and calibration parameters while edges represent nonlinear measurement constraints. This formulation allows us to solve both online pose tracking and offline sensor self-calibration problems.",

        "abstract": "A manipulator which enables noncontact control of the position and attitude of an object on a plane by controlling a fluid field is proposed. The manipulator comprises 2 boards with grid pattern arrangements of holes and a parallel link robot which is capable of translational motion with 2 degrees of freedom and rotational motion with 1 degree of freedom in a plane. Air jets are discharged from the grid of holes. The direction of the air jets from the holes can be controlled by changing the positional relationship of the 2 boards by means of the parallel link robot. This makes it possible to form an air flow with a unidirectional fluid field or a vortex-like fluid field. When an object is placed in the fluid field, translational motion and rotational motion of the object are possible. If the position and attitude of the object are photographed and calculated using high speed camera and feedback control is performed, the position and attitude of the object can be controlled. The structure of the manipulator and the principle of control of the fluid field are described, and the possibility of controlling the translational motion and rotational motion of an object is demonstrated experimentally.",

The posture control scheme results in minimum torque at the actuated joints of the segments. Non-linear optimization is carried out offline for progressively decreasing distance of the robot from the step with torque minimization as objective function and force balance, motor torque limits, slippage avoidance and interference avoidance constraints. The resulting angles of the joints are fitted to a third degree polynomial as a function of the robot distance from the step and the step height. It is shown that a single set of polynomial functions is sufficient for climbing steps of all permissible heights and angles of attack of the front segment. The methodology has been verified through simulation followed by implementation on the real robot. As a consequence of this optimization we find that the average current reduced by more than thirty percent, reducing power consumption and confirming the efficacy of the optimization framework.",

The pouch motors are developed to create printable actuators for enhancing mass-fabrication of robots from sheet materials using easily accessible tools. The pouch motor consists of one or more gas-tight bladders (called pouches) fabricated by heat bonding. We developed two types of actuators from inflatable pouches: the linear pouch motor and the rotational pouch motor. Our theoretical analysis predicts the static force-length and moment-angle relationships of these actuators under pressure control. We compare the theoretical bounds with actual results achieved using several fabricated devices. We developed a fabrication process of pouch motors using a heat stamping technique that allows mass-manufacturing. We also demonstrate three robot bodies with embedded pouch motors: a parallel gripper, a robotic arm with antagonistic actuation, and legged walking robot with a self-contained miniature pneumatic system.",

        "abstract": "The augmentation of human power and endurance by way of a power assisted exoskeleton could revolutionize rehabilitation, industry and the battlefield. The use of servo motors placed near limb joints results in a rotary motion of the human limb which adapts well to attaching the exoskeleton to the limb and to integrate limb movement. Air muscles or pneumatics offers advantages over DC motors for instantaneous high thrust limb motion using light weight components and even soft and malleable exoskeletons. However these implementations mimic human muscle and apply forces longitudinally resulting in high compression forces on the longitudinal exoskeleton. In the rotary approach forces are applied perpendicularly so as to flex adjoining limbs. In this rotary case the device can be designed to be more easily attached and worn. The work reported here describes the progress with a new type of exoskeleton and air muscle design based on a new approach to exoskeleton and air muscle layout that combines contractive actuation with rotary motion. The aim is to reduce the need for bulky exoskeleton members, share out forces over larger areas and thereby demonstrate strapless, comfortable and easy fitting footwear. The developed prototype is tested for augmenting a test subject's explosive power and significantly reducing the metabolic cost of walking while carrying a heavy load.",

These balancing actions can be very demanding in terms of power and torque requirements for ankle joints especially after strong and sudden impacts. In this work, an optimal control problem is formulated for the linearized inverted pendulum model to reduce the peak power requirements during ankle balancing strategy. This optimal control which reduces peak torque and power is computed numerically and approximated by a piecewise linear function of the states called the approximate optimal compliance regulator. The balancing ability of this compliance regulator is evaluated against other optimal compliance methods. The stability of the linearly switching approximated optimal compliance regulator is determined from practical perspective using quadratic stability and parameter dependent Lyapunov functions. The efficacy of the proposed stabilizer is validated for a compliant humanoid.",

This wheelchair has great potential not only as an effective rehabilitation device but also as a mobility assistive device. However, the commercially available model has several hardware limitations that affect the steering operation. In this paper, we discuss these hardware limitations before presenting methods for improving steering maneuverability. Furthermore, we propose power steering and force display controls based on environmental information. From the perspective of safety, we employ servo brakes to control the cycling wheelchair, and the assistive functions are realized based on the feasible braking control region. The proposed control methods are experimentally applied to a newly developed cycling wheelchair with servo brakes, and the results illustrate the validity of the control methods.",

We then derive a separate energy-level controller that regulates the oscillation amplitude, again without changing the system's total energy. Finally, we show that the strategy works on a realistic mechanical system, by synchronising the phase difference and apex height of two bouncing masses.",

We modeled several transmission and actuator design concepts and investigated their force and displacement outputs. The results led to the selection of improved actuator and transmission designs.

        "abstract": "Trajectory optimization is a method for solving motion planning problems by formulating them as non-convex constrained optimization problems. The optimization process, however, can get stuck in local optima that are in collision. As a consequence, these methods typically require multiple initializations. This poses the problem of deciding which initializations to use when given a limited computational budget. In this paper we propose a machine learning approach to predict whether a collision-free solution will be found from a given initialization. We present a set of trajectory features that encode the obstacle distribution locally around a robot. These features are designed for generalization across different tasks. Our experiments on various planning benchmarks demonstrate the performance of our approach.",

Instantaneous approaches are computationally efficient, but may cause high joint velocities due to their local character. In this paper, we present an efficient implementation of a global approach following Pontryagin's Minimum Principle for online calculation. Within a moving horizon, we exploit the decoupled structure of the resulting optimal control problem by using the conjugate gradient method for solving the nonlinear dynamic problem. Different examples of cost functionals are presented and the real-time capability is shown by applying this approach to a 9-DOF redundant manipulator.",

        "abstract": "The paper considers an a priori given robot trajectory which has to be recomputed when online sensed information on the environment is available. Then the original trajectory is adapted in order to continue the so far commanded motion by the sensed geometric shape. The adapted trajectory has to comply with restrictions on velocity, acceleration and jerk. Furthermore it is desired to converge to the original trajectory. At least if the robot is in contact with the environment it is further essential that the geometrical path is not left when modifying the trajectory. This means that preferably only the temporal profile is changed by scaling or rescaling the velocity. In order to inhibit overshooting, future restrictions are predicted and backtracked in the case of a violation. All this computation is done within a single sampling step, i.e. within 4 ms for a standard KUKA industrial robot. This precludes accurate optimization algorithms. When applied without an a priori given trajectory the method results in an near timeoptimal solution.",

One preliminary experiment is presented in this paper to demonstrate the concept. This experiment comprised of three sets of weight perception tasks.

Two sets of teleoperator based experiments, one with a basic two channel controller and the other with three channel controllers, were used to replicate the same set of experiments.

        "abstract": "Wafer inspection plays a significant role in monitoring the quality of production wafers. However, it requires measuring tools and additional cycle time to do real metrology, which is costly and time-consuming. Therefore, reducing sampling rate to as low as possible is a high priority for many factories to reduce production cost. The most common way for inspecting process quality is to apply periodic sampling. If a manufacturing process is stable, then virtual metrology (VM) may be applied for monitoring the quality of wafers while real metrology is unavailable. Nevertheless, if a production variation occurs between periodic samplings, no real metrology is available during this period for updating the VM models, which may result in un-reliable VM predictions. The authors have developed the automatic virtual metrology (AVM) system for various VM applications. Therefore, this paper focuses on applying various indices of the AVM system to develop an Intelligent Sampling Decision (ISD) scheme for reducing sampling rate while VM accuracy is still sustained.",

The distinctive approach eliminates the interference between two processes which usually induces inaccuracy and sometimes instability on the prioritized inverse solutions. Two degenerate properties of using the QRD are explained and the remedies are provided as the modified damped least-squares pseudoinverse and the numerical reconditioning. The effectiveness are examined by the kinematic simulations with the n-link manipulators in the two-dimensional case and the KUKA LWR in the three-dimensional case.",

Prioritized control is a widespread multi-task technique in robotics and animation: tasks have strict priorities and they are satisfied only as long as they do not conflict with any higher-priority task. Optimal control instead formulates an optimization problem whose solution is either a feedback control policy or a feedforward trajectory of control inputs. We introduce strict priorities in multi-task optimal control problems, as an alternative to weighting task errors proportionally to their importance. This ensures the respect of the specified priorities, while avoiding numerical conditioning issues. We compared our approach with both prioritized control and optimal control with tests on a simulated robot with 11 degrees of freedom.",

The target application is to automate the task of unloading the content of shipping containers. Our goal is to capture possible support relations between objects in partially known static configurations. We employ support vector machines (SVM) to estimate the probability of a support relation between pairs of detected objects using features extracted from their geometrical properties and 3D sampled points of the scene. The set of probabilistic support relations is then used for reasoning about optimally selecting an object to be unloaded first. The proposed approach has been extensively tested and verified on data sets generated in simulation and from real world configurations.",

        "abstract": "Humanoid robots have many potential applications in man-made environments, including performing hazardous tasks, assisting the elderly, and as a replacement for our aging workforce. However, generating a reliable gait for biped robots is challenging, particularly for dynamic gait and in the presence of unknown external disturbances, such as a bump from someone walking by. In this work, a 3D formulation of the Foot Placement Estimator is used with a high-level control strategy to achieve a dynamic gait capable of handling external disturbances. A key benefit of this approach is that the robot is able to respond in real time to external disturbances regardless of whether it is at rest or in motion. This strategy is implemented in simulation to control a 14-DOF lower-body humanoid robot being subjected to unknown external forces, both when at rest and while walking, and shown to generate stabilizing stepping actions.",

CLF based quadratic programs have the inherent capacity to optimally track a desired trajectory. This property is used in congruence with impedance control \u2014 implemented as a feedforward term \u2014 to realize significantly small tracking errors, while simultaneously yielding bipedal walking that is both stable and robust to disturbances. Moreover, instead of experimentally validating this on human subjects, a virtual prosthesis is attached to a robotic testbed, AMBER. The authors claim that the walking of AMBER is human like and therefore form a suitable substitute to human subjects on which a prosthetic control can be tested. Based on this idea, the proposed controller was first verified in simulation, then tested on the physical robot AMBER. The results indicate improved tracking performance, stability, and robustness to unknown disturbances.",

Creating 3D range sensors requires various techniques, such as object detection, tracking, classification, 3D SLAM, etc. For the pre-processing step, superpixels can improve the performance of these techniques. This paper proposes a novel over-segmentation algorithm, known as superpixels, for 3D outdoor urban range data. Superpixels are generated with three steps: boundary extraction using a surface change score and sensor models, initial cluster seeding using a quadtree decomposition, and iterative clustering, which adapts a k-means clustering approach with limited search size in the quadtree dimension. The proposed algorithm produces adaptive superpixel sizes that take into account surface and object border information. This reduces memory size more than regular grid methods and represents small objects well with adaptable pixel sizes. The algorithm is verified using the publicly available Velodyne dataset and the manually annotated ground truth. A comparison with the conventional algorithm is also presented.",

The problem of trajectory generation is firstly separated into generating continuous and bounded curvature profile to shape the trajectory and generating linear velocity profile to execute the trajectory. The curvature profile generation is further converted to an optimization problem with only 3 parameters owing to the specific properties of quartic B\u00e9zier curve. Sequential quadratic programming is employed to find optimal solution with respect to specific objective function. To avoid sideslip and ensure velocity-continuity and acceleration limits, the framework of linear velocity profile generation is also proposed. A simple profile with constant acceleration is also provided as an example. Simulation results on lane keeping and changing and path following demonstrate the capability and the real-time performance of the proposed algorithm.",

A probabilistic depth measurement is carried out in real time on a per-pixel basis and the computed uncertainty is used to reject erroneous estimations and provide live feedback on the reconstruction progress. Our contribution is a novel approach to depth map computation that combines Bayesian estimation and recent development on convex optimization for image processing. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy, while exhibiting high efficiency in memory usage and computing power. We call our approach REMODE (REgularized MOnocular Depth Estimation). Our CUDA-based implementation runs at 30Hz on a laptop computer and is released as open-source software.",

We present the notion of a covariance on RGB-D data. Covariances have not only been proven to be successful in image processing, but in other domains as well. Their main advantage is that they provide a compact and flexible description of point clouds. Our work is a first step towards demonstrating the usability of the concept of covariances in conjunction with RGB-D data. Experiments performed on an RGB-D database and compared to previous results show the increased performance of our method.",

However, the ROS runs on Linux, which does not provide timing guarantees for robot motion. This paper present a hybrid real-time ROS architecture on multi-core processor \u201cRGMP-ROS\u201d, which consists of two parts including the non-real-time subsystem \u201cGPOS (General Operating system)\u201d and the real-time one \u201cRTOS (Real-time Operating system)\u201d. The GPOS is comprised of non-real-time ROS nodes running in Linux, while the RTOS only contains real-time ROS nodes running in Nuttx. To get higher operational efficiency, the RGMP-ROS system is executed by a dual-core processor, one CPU for GPOS and the other for RTOS. The RGMP-ROS has used in the controller of a 6-DOF modular manipulator, and its effectiveness and efficiency are demonstrated by software testing and experiments. The main contributions of the present work lie in the realization of real-time ROS architecture and the application of multi-core processor in the hybrid control of an industrial robot.",

In the case of systems with complex dynamics, the performance of sampling based techniques relies on identifying a good approximation to the cost-to-go distance metric. We propose a technique that uses reinforcement learning to learn this distance metric on the fly from samples and combine it with existing sampling based planners to produce near optimal solutions. The resulting algorithm - RRTPI can solve problems with complex dynamics in a sample efficient manner while preserving asymptotic guarantees. We provide experimental evaluation of this technique on domains with underactuated and underpowered dynamics.",

Conventional random variable based (RV-based) schemes require a detailed knowledge of the system parameters variation and may be not able to fully characterize the uncertainties of the complex dynamic systems. However, the proposed RM-based approach provides a probabilistic framework for systematic characterization of the uncertainties in the complex systems with limited available information. Moreover, RM-based uncertainty model is an efficient mathematical tool that ensures the kinematic and dynamic consistency and takes into account the system complexity, configuration, structural inter-dependencies, etc. The application of the RM-based uncertainty model is investigated using an example of kinematically redundant planar parallel manipulator (3-(P)RRR). The simulation results are compared with those obtained through conventional RV-based approach and the effectiveness of the proposed method is discussed.",

This system can synchronize two camera inputs that share the same view with only a very small sub-microsecond time delay. Real-time video processing is performed using the hardware logic by extracting the moment features of multiple cells at 2000 fps or more, which are obtained from the two camera inputs, and their frame-straddling time can be adjusted from 0 to 0.5 ms in 9.9 ns steps. After setting the frame-straddling time within a certain range to avoid large image displacements between the two camera inputs, the frame-straddling high-speed vision platform can perform simultaneous shape and motion analysis of cells in fast microchannel flows of 1 m/s or greater. The results of real-time experiments conducted to analyze the deformabilities, velocities, and shapes of fast-flowing sea urchin egg cells in straight and L-type microchannels verified the efficacy of our vision-based cell analysis system.",

The controller is designed to complete the task of servoing the robot's endeffectors to the desired pose, while regulating orientation of the base-satellite. Task redundancy approach is utilized to coordinate the servoing process and attitude of the base satellite. The visual task is defined as a primary task, while regulating attitude of the base satellite to zero is defined as a secondary task. The secondary task is formulated as an optimization problem in such a way that it does not affect the primary task, and simultaneously minimizes its cost function. A set of numerical experiments are carried out on a dual-arm space robot showing efficacy of the proposed control methodology.",

Kinect-based sensor system detects obstacles with velocity and dimension estimated for obstacle modeling. With identified obstacles, repulsion vectors of potential field given by obstacles modify walking path of a biped robot. On-line path generation (OPG) is proposed to generate walking path towards a target configuration including position and orientation. With reference mapping combined with walking pattern generator based on zero momentum point (ZMP), reactive walking patterns free of obstacle collision are thus created. The effectiveness of this method is confirmed on a biped robot developed in our lab, and the robot is capable of avoiding obstacles while maintaining ZMP stability. The contribution of this paper is to propose OPG for obstacle avoidance of biped robots by extending potential field method. The Demonstration of the proof of concept has been successfully conducted.",

Our method consists of two main ingredients: (a) an off-line sampling-based algorithm for the construction of a global transition system that contains a path satisfying the LTL formula, and (b) an on-line sampling-based algorithm to generate paths that service the local requests, while making sure that the satisfaction of the global specification is not affected.

By using a binary descriptor and metric-topological mapping, the system demonstrates real-time performance on a large-scale outdoor environment without utilizing GPUs or reducing input image size.

        "abstract": "We present a real-time RGB-D based multiperson detection and tracking system suitable for mobile robots and head-worn cameras. Our approach combines RGB-D visual odometry estimation, region-of-interest processing, ground plane estimation, pedestrian detection, and multi-hypothesis tracking components into a robust vision system that runs at more than 20fps on a laptop. As object detection is the most expensive component in any such integration, we invest significant effort into taking maximum advantage of the available depth information. In particular, we propose to use two different detectors for different distance ranges. For the close range (up to 5\u20137m), we present an extremely fast depth-based upper-body detector that allows video-rate system performance on a single CPU core when applied to Kinect sensors. In order to cover also farther distance ranges, we optionally add an appearance-based full-body HOG detector (running on the GPU) that exploits scene geometry to restrict the search space. Our approach can work with both Kinect RGB-D input for indoor settings and with stereo depth input for outdoor scenarios. We quantitatively evaluate our approach on challenging indoor and outdoor sequences and show state-of-the-art performance in a large variety of settings. Our code is publicly available.",

        "abstract": "Temporal asynchrony between two cameras in the vision system is a usual problem in practice. In some vision task such as estimating fast moving targets, the estimation error caused by the tiny temporal asynchrony will become non-ignorable essentials. This paper will address on the asynchrony in the stereo vision system of humanoid Ping-Pong robot, and present a real-time accurate Ping-Pong ball trajectory estimation algorithm. In our approach, the complex Ping-Pong ball motion model is simplified by a polynomial parameter function of time t due to the limited observing time interval and the requirement of real-time computation. We then use the perspective projection camera model to re-project the ball's parameter function on time t into its image coordinates on both cameras. Based on the assumption that the time gap of two asynchronous cameras will maintain a const during very short time interval, we can obtain the time gap value and also the trajectory parameters of the Ping-Pong ball in a short time interval by minimizing the errors between the images of the ball in each camera and their re-projection images from the modeled parameter function on time t. Comprehensive experiments on real Ping-Pong robot cases are carried out, the results show our approach is more proper for the vision system of humanoid Ping-Pong robot, when concerning the accuracy and real-time performance simultaneously.",

The usual approaches to robotic control \u2014 following pre-defined trajectories or planning online with reduced models \u2014 are both inapplicable. Dexterous manipulation is so sensitive to small variations in contact force and object location that it seems to require online planning without any simplifications. Here we demonstrate for the first time online planning (or model-predictive control) with a full physics model of a humanoid hand, with 28 degrees of freedom and 48 pneumatic actuators. We augment the actuation space with motor synergies which speed up optimization without removing dexterity. Most of our results are in simulation, showing non-prehensile object manipulation as well as typing. In both cases the input to the system is a high level task description, while all details of the hand movement emerge online from fully automated numerical optimization.",

While accurate knowledge and control of generated damping is essential for achieving the desired performance, no physical sensor measuring the damping exists. This work introduces a novel non-model-based approach for the estimation of time-variant damping for variable impedance actuation systems. The approach is based only on torque and position/velocity measurements; without the knowledge of system's inputs, to ensure the estimation of both intentional and unintentional changes. Hence, a recursive least square estimator, modified for achieving a proper convergence for the estimation of time-variant parameters, is exploited. Experiments on a variable physical damping actuator are also presented to validate the performance of proposed approach.",

This is realized with a decentralized Model Predictive Control under dynamic virtual structure architecture. A specific limitation of virtual structure based formation method is the necessity of access to the desired reference. To remove this requirement, a distributed estimator is developed so that each vehicle can construct the desired reference based on the local information exchange. In formation trajectory planning, several issues are taken into consideration which includes: (i) distributed formation achievement by a team of nonholonomic vehicles from initial situation. (ii) inter-group collision avoidance. (iii) dynamic formation to obtain flexible manoeuvring during movement in unknown and cluttered environment. (iv) obstacle avoidance. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology in producing optimal formation trajectory planning for multiple nonholonomic vehicles.",

The hand pose and posture are estimated by fitting a virtual hand model to the 3D point cloud obtained from a Kinect camera using an inverse kinematics approach. We use real human hand movements captured with a Vicon motion tracking system as the ground truth for deriving natural hand synergies based on principal component analysis. These synergies are integrated in the tracking scheme by optimizing the posture in a reduced parameter space. Tracking in this reduced space combined with joint limit avoidance constrains the posture estimation to natural hand articulations. The information loss associated with dimension reduction can be dealt with by employing a hierarchical optimization scheme. We show that our synergistic hand tracking approach improves runtime performance and increases the quality of the posture estimation.",

In our approach, we use a compact human model and consider the positions of the endeffectors as well as the center of mass as the most important aspects to imitate. Our system actively balances the center of mass over the support polygon to avoid falls of the robot, which would occur when using direct imitation. For every point in time, our approach generates a statically stable pose. Hereby, we do not constrain the configurations to be in double support. Instead, we allow for changes of the support mode according to the motions to imitate. To achieve safe imitation, we use retargeting of the robot's feet if necessary and find statically stable configurations by inverse kinematics. We present experiments using human data captured with an Xsens MVN motion capture system. The results show that a Nao humanoid is able to reliably imitate complex whole-body motions in real time, which also include extended periods of time in single support mode, in which the robot has to balance on one foot.",

        "abstract": "Forward-looking sonar can be used for underwater mapping when water visibility is poor. The generation of an acoustic mosaic of the environment is of high interest when underwater vehicles are used for surveys or search tasks. Moreover, if the mosaic is generated in real-time it can be used to provide instantaneous location feedback (e.g. to a ROV pilot or to an AUV), to ensure complete coverage of an area or facilitate the immediate location of targets. In this paper, we present an approach for achieving such a real-time mosaicing capability. Our system considers a simplified imaging model and estimates 2D sonar motions from the pairwise registration of sonar frames. The registration is performed by using a Fourier-based technique, avoiding the extraction of features and ensuring a fast implementation. The mosaicing problem is formulated using a pose graph, with the vertices being the sonar image positions and the edges being constraints from the vehicle odometry and the registration of consecutive and non-consecutive frames. The graph is incrementally optimized using the g2o framework and the optimized poses are then used to build the mosaic online. We apply the method on data gathered on real conditions and show that the resulting sonar mosaic closely matches both the offline generated mosaic as well as ground truth measurements while operating under real-time constraints.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel Gaussian process motion controller that can navigate through a crowded dynamic environment. The proposed motion controller predicts future trajectories of pedestrians using an autoregressive Gaussian process motion model (AR-GPMM) from the partially-observable egocentric view of a robot and controls a robot using an autoregressive Gaussian process motion controller (AR-GPMC) based on predicted pedestrian trajectories. The performance of the proposed method is extensively evaluated in simulation and validated experimentally using a Pioneer 3DX mobile robot with a Microsoft Kinect sensor. In particular, the proposed method shows over 68% improvement on the collision rate compared to a reactive planner and vector field histogram (VFH).",

        "abstract": "We present an algorithm for receding-horizon motion planning using a finite family of motion primitives for underactuated dynamic walking over uneven terrain. The motion primitives are defined as virtual holonomic constraints, and the special structure of underactuated mechanical systems operating subject to virtual constraints is used to construct closed-form solutions and a special binary search tree that dramatically speed up motion planning. We propose a greedy depth-first search and discuss improvement using energy-based heuristics. The resulting algorithm can plan several footsteps ahead in a fraction of a second for both the compass-gait walker and a planar 7-Degree-of-freedom/five-link walker.",

        "abstract": "Concentric-tube robots can offer a suitable compromise between force and curvature control. In a previous study by the authors, a real-time trajectory tracking scheme for an unloaded concentric-tube robot was developed. One of the practical barriers to the use of a concentric-tube robot in medical applications is compensation for the impact of environmental forces which can cause drastic deterioration in tracking performance. In this paper, by modifying the robot's forward kinematics and Jacobian, a new method is developed to facilitate tip tracking in real-time while accounting for an external load at the robot's tip. By considering the tip deflection resulting from the external load, a novel dual-layer control architecture is proposed to compensate for this deflection during trajectory tracking. In order to measure the force exerted on the tip position of the robot, a new technique is proposed that can move the sensing system from the distal tip to the proximal base. Experimental results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

The biarticular actuation mechanism is inspired from the musculoskeletal structure of animals and is utilized in the controller design, as well as the mechanism design. For an effective and convenient expression of the equation of motion, the rotating coordinate system is adopted unlike the conventional robotic manipulators, the dynamics of which are obtained in the fixed coordinate system. It is proved in this paper that the biarticular actuation mechanism makes the control of the end-effector easier, more robust, and more intuitive than typical actuation mechanisms. Based on the derived equation of motion of a robotic manipulator in the rotating coordinate system, a disturbance-observer-based controller is proposed for realization of the Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) model, which is a common model of human lower extremities but has seldom been realized in practice. The proposed methods are all verified by simulation studies in this paper.",

Realtime tracking is achieved by a geometric particle filter on the affine group. Based on the tracked output, the pose of a 7-DoF WAM robotic arm is continuously updated using dynamic motor primitives until a distance measure between the tracked object and the gripper mounted on the arm is below a threshold. Then, it closes its three fingers and grasps the object. The tracker works in realtime and is robust to noise and partial occlusions. Using only the depth data makes our tracker independent of texture which is one of the key design goals in our approach. An experimental evaluation is provided along with a comparison of the proposed tracker with state-of-the-art approaches, including the OpenNI-tracker. The developed system is integrated with ROS and made available as part of IRI's ROS stack.",

        "abstract": "Modern multi-agent systems frequently use highlevel planners to extract basic paths for agents, and then rely on local collision avoidance to ensure that the agents reach their destinations without colliding with one another or dynamic obstacles. One state-of-the-art local collision avoidance technique is Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA). Despite being fast and efficient for circular-shaped agents, ORCA may deadlock when polygonal shapes are used. To address this shortcoming, we introduce Reciprocally-Rotating Velocity Obstacles (RRVO). RRVO generalizes ORCA by introducing a notion of rotation for polygonally-shaped agents. This generalization permits more realistic motion than ORCA and does not suffer from as much deadlock. In this paper, we present the theory of RRVO and show empirically that it does not suffer from the deadlock issue ORCA has, permits agents to reach goals faster, and has a comparable collision rate at the cost of performance overhead quadratic in the (typically small) user-defined parameter \u03b4.",

The framework presented here represents the recognition part of the entire pipeline of dexterous manipulation of deformable objects, which contains grasping, recognition, regrasping, placing flat, and folding. We first create an off-line simulation of the deformable objects and capture depth images from different view points as training data. Then by extracting features and applying sparse coding and dictionary learning, we build up a codebook for a set of different poses of a particular deformable object category. The whole framework contains two layers which yield a robust system that first classifies deformable objects on category level and then estimates the current pose from a group of predefined poses of a single deformable object. The system is tested on a variety of similar deformable objects and achieves a high output accuracy. By knowing the current pose of the garment, we can continue with further tasks such as regrasping and folding.",

        "abstract": "The setup of tilting a 2D laser range finder up and down is a widespread strategy to acquire 3D point clouds. This setup requires that the scene is static while the robot takes a 3D scan. If an object moves through the scene during the measurement process and one does not take into account these movements, the resulting model will get distorted. This paper presents an approach to reconstruct the 3D model of a moving rigid object from the inconsistent set of 2D measurements by the help of a camera. Our approach utilizes optical flow in the camera images to estimate the motion in the image plane and point-line constraints to compensate the missing information about the motion in depth. We combine multiple sweeps and/or views into to a single consistent model using a point-to-plane ICP approach and optimize single sweeps by smoothing the resulting trajectory. Experiments obtained in real outdoor scenarios with moving cars demonstrate that our approach yields accurate models.",

        "abstract": "The determination of the mechanical properties of cells plays an important role in biological studies and has gained acceptance recently as a possible label-free biomarker for cell status determination or diseases detection. Investigations on how external cellular properties affect cell mechanics are helpful in understanding cell disease processes and cell morphogenesis, which are of large significance in medical science. Although most researchers have focused on individual cell mechanics, or the effect of substrate stiffness on cells, cell mechanical response due to interactions among cells is yet to be examined. A reason for this is that the study of cell mechanical response to cell shape requires one to use a cell patterning process. However, existing cell patterning methods are very complex and time-consuming. In this paper, we describe a practical and rapid technique that can easily pattern cells into desired shapes, which allows investigations of the effect of external environment on cell stiffness. In the new technique, Poly-(ethylene) glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogel film with thickness 70\u2013100 nm is controllably patterned on a hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) substrate by polymerizing PEGDA molecules in-situ using programmable visual light patterns. The idea is to enable the confinement of cells cultured on the hydrogels into special areas. The elastic modulus of the patterned cells is measured using an atomic force microscope. Experimental results have demonstrated the versatility of the technique as a tool for cell pattering and exploration of cell mechanics under external mechanical stimuli.",

        "abstract": "We present a framework for reinforcement learning (RL) in a scenario where multiple simulators are available with decreasing amounts of fidelity to the real-world learning scenario. Our framework is designed to limit the number of samples used in each successively higher-fidelity/cost simulator by allowing the agent to choose to run trajectories at the lowest level that will still provide it with information. The approach transfers state-action Q-values from lower-fidelity models as heuristics for the \u201cKnows What It Knows\u201d family of RL algorithms, which is applicable over a wide range of possible dynamics and reward representations. Theoretical proofs of the framework's sample complexity are given and empirical results are demonstrated on a remote controlled car with multiple simulators. The approach allows RL algorithms to find near-optimal policies for the real world with fewer expensive real-world samples than previous transfer approaches or learning without simulators.",

The approach is based on previously proposed bubble space representation - where all sensory features and their relative S2- geometry are encoded in a manner that is implicitly dependent on robot pose. Its novelty is that ensuring sensory data reliability is integrated with place detection. This is achieved via checking for informativeness, coherence and plenitude using only the bubble space representation of the incoming sensory data. The stringency of these checks is controllable via a set of associated parameters. Experimental results with benchmark datasets indicate correct detection rates comparable to state-of-the-art approaches in place detection. Furthermore, the detected places can then be immediately used to generate the nodes in topological maps.",

        "abstract": "Rotary Series Elastic Actuators (SEAs) are largely adopted to safely and accurately modulate interaction torques when robots operate in close contact with humans. Torque control is often based on a cascade scheme including PI regulators for a velocity controller nested in a torque controller. This solution is simple, robust and can potentially guarantee coupled stability. A high-level impedance control loop is also commonly added to regulate the behavior of the interaction port as a desired virtual viscoelastic body. In the present work, passivity is analyzed when a cascade controlled SEA is employed to display a virtual parallel spring-damper system. The case of a null desired impedance and of a pure spring are also tackled. The range of renderable mechanical impedance and guidelines for the selection of the control gains are derived.",

This means dealing with two important issues: 1) the induction of possible transfers, i.e., whether a given object affords a given task, and 2) the planning of a grasp that will allow the robot to fulfill the task. The induction of object affordances is approached by abstracting the sensory input of an object as a set of attributes that the agent can reason about through similarity and proximity. For grasp execution, we combine a part-based grasp planner with a model of task constraints. The task constraint model indicates areas of the object that the robot can grasp to execute the task. Within these areas, the part-based planner finds a hand placement that is compatible with the object shape. The key contribution is the ability to transfer task parameters across objects while the part-based grasp planner allows for transferring grasp information across tasks. As a result, the robot is able to synthesize plans for previously unobserved task/object combinations. We illustrate our approach with experiments conducted on a real robot.",

In this paper, the Generalized Graph SLAM framework for SLAM under ambiguous data association is presented, and a formal description of using hyperedges to encode uncertain loop closures is given for the first time. The framework combines both hyperedges and multimodal Mixture of Gaussian constraints to cover all sources of ambiguity in SLAM. An extension of the authors' multimodal Prefilter method is developed to find good initial conditions in such a generalized multimodal hypergraph. Experiments on a real world 3D dataset show that the novel multimodal hypergraph Prefilter method is both significantly more robust and faster than other robust state-of-the-art methods.",

In the control design, we shape the total energy (kinetic and potential) of the undamped original system by first excluding external effects. In this way we can assign a new dynamics to the system. Then we apply damping injection to the new system for achieving a desired damped behavior. Then we show how to connect a high-level control input to such system by taking advantage of the new desired physics. We support the theory with extensive simulations by changing the overall behavior of the UAV for different desired dynamics, and show the advantage of this method for sliding on a surface tasks, such as ceiling painting, cleaning or surface inspection.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new device and a method for dynamic manipulation. The device consists of a planar robotic arm and an elastic beam as an end-effector. Using it the elastic end-effector will tend to increase performance and energy efficiency while executing dynamic and repetitive tasks. Through the control of the beam vibration and resonant modes, we modify the state of manipulated objects. For lightweight objects the control is provided through the intermittent contacts without changing dynamics of the beam. However, we show that by using proper synchronization technique continuous-phase contacts are also possible. Juggling and dribbling of a ball are considered to be an alternating non-prehensile catching and throwing task. Such alternating decelerating and accelerating impacts on the ball and the curvature of the beam at the time of impact will stabilize the cyclic orbit of the ball. By proper analysis of continuous-time contact and dynamics of the beam we establish a rhythmic movement of the system. With the variation of frequency and amplitude of the beam it is possible to switch between different dynamic actions such as juggling, dribbling, throwing, catching and balancing.",

In this class of revision problems, the user provides a numerical ranking of the desirability of the subgoals in their specifications. When the specification cannot be satisfied on the system, then our algorithms automatically revise the specification so that the least desirable user goals are removed from the specification. We propose two different versions of the revision problem with preferences. In the first version, the algorithm returns an exact solution while in the second version the algorithm is an approximation algorithm with non-constant approximation ratio. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our algorithms and we experimentally study the approximation ratio of the approximation algorithm on random problem instances.",

In this paper we present an approach for modulating periodic dynamic movement primitives based on force feedback, allowing for rich motor behavior and skills. We propose and evaluate the combination of feedback and learned feed-forward terms to fully adapt the motions of a robot in order to achieve a desired force interaction with the environment. For the learning we employ the notion of repetitive control, which can effectively minimize the error of behavior towards a given reference. To demonstrate the approach, we show results of simulated and real world experiments on a compliant humanoid robot COMAN. We show the initial results of utilizing the approach to control a pedal-racer, a demanding balance toy best described as a hybrid between a skateboard and a bicycle.",

In light of the advantage of range information in object discovery, we first produce initial object hypotheses by clustering the sparse 3D point cloud. The image pixels registered to the clustered 3D points are taken as samples to learn each object's prior knowledge. The priors are represented by Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) of color and 3D location information only, requiring no high-level features. We further formulate the segmentation problem within a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework, which incorporates the learned prior models, together with hard constraints placed on the registered pixels and pairwise spatial constraints to achieve final results. Our algorithm is validated on the challenging KITTI dataset which contains diverse complicated road scenarios. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluation results show the superiority of our algorithm.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a 14-DOF robotic hand including 5 fingers and a wrist. The hand has a new tendon-driven mechanism which minimizes frictional loss and maximizes efficiency and backdrivability. In order to accomplish high efficiency and backdrivability as well as human-like payload and dexterity in a compact size, two novel mechanical concepts are proposed. Firstly, the actuators are placed according to the functions of fingers \u2014 high power grasping and precise manipulation \u2014 instead of positioning at each joint. For the high power grasping, 7 high payload motors are positioned in the forearm, and 5 small size motors are positioned in the palm for the precise manipulation. Secondly, a new tension decoupling mechanism is proposed to the 2-DOF wrist joint, which delivers wire motions of the forearm motors to the fingers without frictional loss or coupling with wrist motion. A total weight including the forearm is 1.59kg which is similar to human. The fingertip force is 15N which is sufficient for most of household work. High backdrivability enables the contact force sensing by measuring a motor current without additional sensors. A detectable minimum contact force was 0.735N. In order to enhance the contact force sensing capability, a friction compensation algorithm was applied, which resulted to the minimum contact force as 0.196N. Theoretical and experimental analyses are also performed.",

        "abstract": "We propose to frame the problem of marker-less robot arm pose estimation as a pixel-wise part classification problem. As input, we use a depth image in which each pixel is classified to be either from a particular robot part or the background. The classifier is a random decision forest trained on a large number of synthetically generated and labeled depth images. From all the training samples ending up at a leaf node, a set of offsets is learned that votes for relative joint positions. Pooling these votes over all foreground pixels and subsequent clustering gives us an estimate of the true joint positions. Due to the intrinsic parallelism of pixel-wise classification, this approach can run in super real-time and is more efficient than previous ICP-like methods. We quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of this approach on synthetic data. We also demonstrate that the method produces accurate joint estimates on real data despite being purely trained on synthetic data.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present an inspection robot to produce gas distribution maps and localize gas sources in large outdoor environments. The robot is equipped with a 3D laser range finder and a remote gas sensor that returns integral concentration measurements. We apply principles of tomography to create a spatial gas distribution model from integral gas concentration measurements. The gas distribution algorithm is framed as a convex optimization problem and it models the mean distribution and the fluctuations of gases. This is important since gas dispersion is not an static phenomenon and furthermore, areas of high fluctuation can be correlated with the location of an emitting source. We use a compact surface representation created from the measurements of the 3D laser range finder with a state of the art mapping algorithm to get a very accurate localization and estimation of the path of the laser beams. In addition, a conic model for the beam of the remote gas sensor is introduced. We observe a substantial improvement in the gas source localization capabilities over previous state-of-the-art in our evaluation carried out in an open field environment.",

        "abstract": "Robot calibration is widely used in the manufacture industry to enhance and achieve a higher level of accuracy on industrial robot manipulators. Currently, there are many reliable calibration systems able to perform the calibration task. Those systems, however, are far from being a user friendly calibration tool; they are time consuming, very expensive, and usually requires a lot of human interaction. Therefore, we proposed a new calibration system able to overcome those problems with promising results. However, to take the system to the next level, and create an automated calibration process, we need to create a control system capable of guiding the robot's tool center point to a multi-position alignment. Throughout this paper the control approach needed to achieve automation of the entire system is presented and discussed. Simulations and experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of the overall calibration system including hardware, software and control algorithms.",

The proposed design enables the robot to locomote on the horizontal surface using the vibration excitation that is perpendicular to the locomotion direction. The bidirectional locomotion is achieved, and the direction of motion is determined by the vibration frequency. This new type of robot is useful for the unconventional environment where complex moving mechanisms cannot be applied to the robots such as medical, small pipeline, and underwater vehicle applications. To this end, two springs with different stiffness are perpendicularly connected and support the main body of the robot. The dynamic response of this nonlinear system to the vibration enables the robot to walk forward and backward depending on the vibration frequency. The numerical simulation of this system and the experiments with actual hardware design verify the proposed approach.",

Because work stations have to be stopped to perform teaching processes, the manufacturing efficiency is decreased. In this paper we propose to utilize an uncalibrated vision system mounted on a mobile robot (\u201cAdult\u201d robot) with learning capability to supervise a group of fixed robots (\u201cChild\u201d robots) to accomplish a robot teaching task automatically without stopping work stations. To increase the system flexibility, hand-eye calibration and calibration between the robots are eliminated. A Partial Observable Markov Decision Process(POMDP) is formulated and solved using the Successive Approximation of the Reachable Space under Optimal Policies (SARSOP) algorithm to enable the teaching process using image features with uncertainties. The proposed algorithm was tested using the \u201cadult\u201d robot to teach a \u201cchild\u201d robot to perform a high accuracy peg-in-hole assembly process. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The proposed method can also be used in other areas to enable robot teaching.",

        "abstract": "In cell manipulation with optical tweezers, it is required that the cell must be located within the optical trap. Due to the lack of a control technique that can automatically locate the cell within the optical trap while controlling the cell motion, the cell will easily escape from the optical trap and hence the manipulation task is failed. Therefore, development of a unified controller that can control both cell trapping and cell motion simultaneously has received increased attention in optical cell manipulations. In this paper, we addressed this challenging problem by developing a novel visual based control method that controls both cell positioning and cell trapping simultaneously. We first established a new geometric model aiming for confining the cell within a local region near the optical trap, and then formulated a so-called Cell-Tweezers Coalition (C-T Coalition). We secondly developed a potential field function based controller to drive the C-T Coalition to the desired position while avoiding collisions with any other obstacles in environment. Finally, we performed experiments of transferring yeast cells to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Open issues are therefore on the applicability/scalability of standard methods in workspace sub-regions and on the metrics used for the calibration performance evaluation. The paper proposes an algorithm designed to high-accuracy local dynamic identification, comparing it with the results achievable by a common IRs dynamic calibration method and by the same method scaled to a workspace sub-region. In addition, unlike from standard, the here reported experimental comparison is made by evaluating the torque prediction error for IRs robot moving along path programmed by standard/commercial IR motion planner and not along path belonging to the same template-class of trajectory used in identification phase.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates application of machine learning to the problem of contact perception between a robot's gripper and an object. The input data comprises a multidimensional time-series produced by a force/torque sensor at the robot's wrist, the robot's proprioceptive information, namely, the position of the end-effector, as well as the robot's control command. These data are used to train a hidden Markov model (HMM) classifier. The output of the classifier is a prediction of the contact state, which includes no contact, a contact aligned with the central axis of the valve, and an edge contact. To distinguish between contact states, the robot performs exploratory behaviors that produce distinct patterns in the time-series data. The patterns are discovered by first analyzing the data using a probabilistic clustering algorithm that transforms the multidimensional data into a one-dimensional sequence of symbols. The symbols produced by the clustering algorithm are used to train the HMM classifier. We examined two exploratory behaviors: a rotation around the x-axis, and a rotation around the y-axis of the gripper. We show that using these two exploratory behaviors we can successfully predict a contact state with an accuracy of 88 \u00b1 5 % and 81 \u00b1 10 %, respectively.",

The development of a more intuitive and user-friendly control system has the potential to greatly enhance the safety, efficacy, and efficiency of endoscopic procedures. Based on a first generation prototype, our lab designed an ergonomically enhanced flexible endoscopy robotic system. The system was designed to enable the surgeon to operate the endoscope through a low cost game controller.

The initial evaluations show the feasibility of this approach.",

        "abstract": "Microscopic optics and cameras are commonly used in micromanipulation or biomanipulation workstations since they provide a large spectrum of visual details and information. The visual feedback information also improves robustness to uncertainty and accuracy of micromanipulation. Among various micromanipulation systems, optical tweezers are one of the most useful instruments that utilize a focused beam of light to manipulate biological cell or nanoparticles without physical contact. However, current optical manipulation techniques fail if the laser beam is not within the field of view (FOV) of the microscope. To solve this problem, we present a robotic control technique for optical manipulation with limited FOV of microscope. The proposed control strategy consists of a vision based control that manipulates the trapped cell to move to a desired position inside the FOV and a Cartesian-space feedback control that drives the laser beam back when it is outside the FOV. Thus, the proposed method allows the laser beam to leave the FOV during the course of manipulation and the transition from one feedback to another is smooth. The stability of the closed-loop system is analysed by using Lyapunov-like methods, with consideration of the dynamic interaction between the cell and the manipulator of the laser source. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.",

A prototype design is presented along with evaluation experiments that demonstrate its capabilities to apply traction forces to ex vivo esophageal tissues.",

Although the first methods for occupancy mapping relied on a 2D grid representation, 3D volumetric approaches are becoming increasingly popular. In this paper we present a new volumetric mapping approach that is based on the OctoMap method. We designed this method to be more robust against measurement errors, in particular against high temporally or spatially correlated errors usually received from a stereo vision system. For this purpose, we define a probability measure that a voxel is currently visible. An update of a voxel's occupancy probability then happens with respect to this visibility probability, allowing us to neglect measurements for voxels that are actually unobservable. Finally, we model the depth error of a stereo vision sensor, and take care of this error when performing a map update. By evaluation we show that our method produces maps with far less erroneous artifacts compared to OctoMap. Our maps also require less memory, and due to an optimized update reduction, our method is also faster than OctoMap when processing dense range measurement data.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of planning a path for an autonomous vehicle from a start to a goal location in presence of sensor intermittency modeled as a stochastic process, in addition to process and measurement noise. The aim is to plan a path that minimizes the localizational uncertainty for the vehicle upon arriving at the goal location. The main contribution of this paper is two-fold. We first show that it is possible to obtain an analytical bound on the performance of a state estimator under sensor misdetection (intermittency) occurring stochastically over time. We then use this bound in a sample-based path planning algorithm to produce a path that trades off accuracy and robustness. This extends the recent body of work on planning under uncertainty to include the fact that sensors may not provide any measurement owing to misdetection. This is caused either by adverse environmental conditions that prevent the sensors from making measurements or by the fundamental limitations of the sensors. Examples include RF-based ranging devices that intermittently do not receive the signal from beacons because of obstacles or the misdetection of features by a camera system in detrimental lighting conditions. Computational results demonstrate the benefit of the approach and comparisons are made with the state of the art in path planning in belief space.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Recently, mobile devices such as smart phones and quad-copters are being equipped with inertial measurement units (IMUs) because of advances in micro-electro-mechanical systems technology. This has increased the importance of IMU- camera fusion for vision-based applications. However, ultralow-cost IMUs take much less accurate measurements than low-cost and high-cost IMUs. This uncertainty degrades the accuracy and reliability of IMU-camera calibration, which is the most important step for IMU-camera fusion technology. In this paper, we propose three effective algorithms for robust IMU- camera calibration with uncertain measurements: boundary constraint, adaptive prediction, and angular velocity constraint. These algorithms incorporate a Bayesian filtering framework to estimate calibration parameters more efficiently. The experimental results on both simulation and real data demonstrated the superiority of the proposed algorithms.",

The approach consists of two major components: 1) a multi-limbed locomotion planner that takes as input a ladder model and automatically generates a whole-body climbing trajectory that satisfies contact, collision, and torque limit constraints; 2) a compliance controller which allows the robot to tolerate errors from sensing, calibration, and execution. Simulations demonstrate that the robot is capable of climbing a wide range of ladders and tolerating disturbances and errors. Physical experiments demonstrate the DRC-Hubo humanoid robot successfully mounting, climbing, and dismounting an industrial ladder similar to the one intended to be used in the DARPA Robotics Challenge Trials.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Motion planning in belief space (under motion and sensing uncertainty) is a challenging problem due to the computational intractability of its exact solution. The Feedback-based Information RoadMap (FIRM) framework made an important theoretical step toward enabling roadmap-based planning in belief space and provided a computationally tractable version of belief space planning. However, there are still challenges in applying belief space planners to physical systems, such as the discrepancy between computational models and real physical models. In this paper, we propose a dynamic replanning scheme in belief space to address such challenges. Moreover, we present techniques to cope with changes in the environment (e.g., changes in the obstacle map), as well as unforeseen large deviations in the robot's location (e.g., the kidnapped robot problem). We then utilize these techniques to implement the first online replanning scheme in belief space on a physical mobile robot that is robust to changes in the environment and large disturbances. This method demonstrates that belief space planning is a practical tool for robot motion planning.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a distributed robust deployment algorithm for optimal coverage by a mobile sensor network (MSN). Much past research has focused on versions of the coverage problem that partition the workspace into regions, and then assign exactly one sensor to cover each region. For this case it has been shown that the optimal partition is the Voronoi partition, and that Lloyd's algorithm converges to the optimal solution, with each sensor located at the centroid of its Voronoi region. In this paper, we consider the case in which k sensors are assigned to each region in the partition, in order to obtain coverage that is robust to sensor failure. For this case, we prove that the optimal workspace partition is the order-k Voronoi partition, with each sensor assigned to those order-k Voronoi regions for which it is a generator. The collection of these regions for a given sensor defines its effective sensing region (ESR), and we prove that in the optimal configuration each sensor is located at the centroid of its ESR. Finally we introduce a distributed algorithm for our optimal sensor placement problem that requires only simple peer-to-peer (P2P) communications. We show via simulation results that our algorithm converges in finite time, and provides competitive coverage performance in the presence of individual node failures.",

While these approaches improve robustness to outliers, they are susceptible to getting caught in local minima, a problem which is exacerbated by poor initial estimates. In this paper, we describe a stochastic gradient descent optimization approach that exhibits greater robustness to poor initial estimates. Our approach can either be used as a stand-alone optimization system or in conjunction with existing methods such as Gauss-Newton solvers. Using a combination of synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed approach is able to recover correct pose graphs significantly more frequently than other methods when large initialization errors are present.",

In this tracker, the importance of test sample has been integrated to improve the tracking stability, accuracy and real-time performances. The experimental results show that this algorithm is more robust, efficient and accurate against the existing state-of-art trackers, overcoming the problems generated by the challenging situations such as obvious appearance change, variant surrounding illumination, partial aircraft occlusion, blur motion, rapid pose variation and onboard mechanical vibration, low computation capacity and delayed information communication between UAVs and Ground Station (GS).

An emergency controller that would successfully stabilize the helicopter in a safe flight mode when a pilot/autopilot fails to control it, owing to unexpected reasons, is of outmost importance in flight control systems. In this direction, we propose a low complexity nonlinear control scheme that drives the angles and the vertical speed to zero with prescribed transient and steady state response, without incorporating any knowledge of the dynamic model parameters in the control design. The stereographic coordinates were employed to model the attitude state of the helicopter in an attempt to guarantee the safe stabilization for every possible initial orientation without introducing any representation singularities as in the Euler angles representation or increasing complexity as in conventional four element quaternions. Moreover, the transient and steady state performance of the proposed scheme is a priori determined even in the presence of external disturbances. Furthermore, the overall control scheme can be easily implemented on embedded flight systems equipped with low-cost sensors. Finally, simulation and experimental results on a realistic platform verify the efficacy of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Robust vehicle detection is one of the key task for autonomous vehicle under the complex urban environment. Using 3D Lidar, the difficulty of the task lies in that the appearance of a vehicle in the sparse range data changes greatly with the distance, the angle of view, as well as occlusions. In this paper we present a new algorithm to detect vehicles using the finely segmented 3D object points. In segmentation, RGLOS (Ring Gradient based Local Optimal Segmentation) algorithm is proposed. Instead of processing in the grid map, the point-wise segmentation method keeps the connection between points and is able to extract object points in far distance. Using the local optimal ground height, it produces much more correct object points with less wrong ground points. In feature extraction stage, three novel features: position-related shape, object height along length and reflective intensity histogram are proposed. Finally the kernel based SVM is used to finish the classification task. Experiments are carried out using the real data acquired from urban environment. The results demonstrate the superior performance comparing with previous methods, thanks to the improved segmentation and new features.",

        "abstract": "As we seek to develop more maneuverable legged robots, we need to understand the dynamics of legged turning in an approachable fashion. In this work, we analyze the dynamic turning motion of a dynamic hexapedal millirobot. We explore a family of phase locked turning gaits where all legs of the robot move at the same speed. These gaits are highly periodic, allowing the vertical height and roll angle of the robot to be approximated by single harmonic sinusoidal functions. We demonstrate that oscillations in height and roll angle determine the robot's turning behavior. The phase between these oscillations (and therefore the turning behavior) was modulated by the phase between the left and right sets of legs. A simple model using compliant leg forces was shown to match turning behavior for a range of 5Hz turning gaits. Based on the finding that roll oscillations are major determinants of turning behavior, we modified the robot to create a new high speed turning gait (forward velocity: 0.4 m/s, turn rate 206\u00b0/s).",

        "abstract": "Human running motion can be modeled by a spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP). However, this model, despite being widely used in robotics, does not include human-like pelvic motion. In this study, we show that the pelvis actually contributes to the increase in jumping force and absorption of landing impact, both of which findings can be used to improve running robots. On the basis of the analysis of human running motion, we propose a new model named SLIP2 (spring loaded inverted pendulum using pelvis). This model is composed of a body mass, a pelvis, and leg springs; the model can control its springs during running by use of pelvic movement in the frontal plane. To achieve hopping and running motions, we developed pelvis oscillation control, running velocity control, and stabilization control using an upper body, as control methods. We also developed a new hopping robot using the SLIP2 model. To evaluate the proposed model and control methods, we performed hopping and running simulations. The simulation results showed that the SLIP2 model successfully achieves hopping and running motions. The hopping robot was also able to accomplish hopping motion. The simulation results also showed that the difference between the pelvic rotational phase and the phase of oscillation of the mass vertical displacement affects the jumping force. In particular, the results revealed that the human-like pelvic rotation contributes to the absorption of landing impact and to the increase in takeoff forces, which validates our observations in human motion analysis.",

        "abstract": "We present a new approach to integrated task and motion planning (ITMP) for robots performing mobile manipulation. In our approach, the user writes a high-level specification that captures partial knowledge about a mobile manipulation setting. In particular, this specification includes a plan outline that syntactically defines a space of plausible integrated plans, a set of logical requirements that the generated plan must satisfy, and a description of the physical space that the robot manipulates. A synthesis algorithm is now used to search for an integrated plan that falls within the space defined by the plan outline, and also satisfies all requirements. Our synthesis algorithm complements continuous motion planning algorithms with calls to a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver. From the scene description, a motion planning algorithm is used to construct a placement graph, an abstraction of a manipulation graph whose paths represent feasible, low-level motion plans. An SMT-solver is now used to symbolically explore the space of all integrated plans that correspond to paths in the placement graph, and also satisfy the constraints demanded by the plan outline and the requirements. Our approach is implemented in a system called Ro-bosynth. We have evaluated Robosynth on a generalization of an ITMP problem investigated in prior work. The experiments demonstrate that our method is capable of generating integrated plans for a number of interesting variations on the problem.",

The semi-direct approach eliminates the need of costly feature extraction and robust matching techniques for motion estimation. Our algorithm operates directly on pixel intensities, which results in subpixel precision at high frame-rates. A probabilistic mapping method that explicitly models outlier measurements is used to estimate 3D points, which results in fewer outliers and more reliable points. Precise and high frame-rate motion estimation brings increased robustness in scenes of little, repetitive, and high-frequency texture. The algorithm is applied to micro-aerial-vehicle state-estimation in GPS-denied environments and runs at 55 frames per second on the onboard embedded computer and at more than 300 frames per second on a consumer laptop. We call our approach SVO (Semi-direct Visual Odometry) and release our implementation as open-source software.",

In the meantime, the scale and complexity of recent medical robot systems have been increasing and this further complicates the effective representation and sharing of safety designs. As an approach to this issue, we propose the Safety Design View, a conceptual framework that can capture and describe both the design-time and run-time characteristics of safety features of medical robot systems in a systematic and structured manner. To illustrate the application of the Safety Design View, we collected a set of frequently used safety features, based on our literature review of safety in the medical robotics domain, and show how we can more effectively describe and understand safety designs of medical robot systems.",

To keep the completeness of salient regions, the input image is segmented into several regions firstly. Then for each region, local saliency and global saliency are generated respectively. The local saliency is computed by multi-scale neighborhood contrast, and the global saliency is measured according to global spatial distribution and inter-region isolation of features. Based on the local saliency and global saliency, the final saliency can be obtained by the weighted combination of them. The comparison experiment results demonstrate the effective performance of the proposed algorithm on salient region detection.",

        "abstract": "Simulation-based policy improvement (SBPI) has been widely used to improve given base policies through simulation. The basic idea of SBPI is to estimate all the Q-factors for a given state using simulation, and then select the action that achieves the minimal cost. It is therefore of great importance to efficiently use the given budget in order to select the best action with high probability. Different from existing budget allocation algorithms that estimate Q-factors by independent simulation, we share the sample paths to improve the probability of correctly selecting the best action. Our method can be combined with equal allocation, Successive Rejects, and optimal computing budget allocation to enhance their probabilities of correct selection as well as to achieve better policies in SBPI. Such improvement depends on the overlap in reachable states under different actions. Numerical results show that with such overlap, combining our method with equal allocation, Successive Rejects and optimal computing budget allocation produces higher probability of selection as well as better policies in SBPI.",

        "abstract": "Many Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) approaches rely on samples to either obtain an estimate of the value function or a linearisation of the underlying system model. However, these approaches typically neglect the fact that the accuracy of the policy update depends on the closeness of the resulting trajectory distribution to these samples. The greedy operator does not consider such closeness constraint to the samples. Hence, the greedy operator can lead to oscillations or even instabilities in the policy updates. Such undesired behaviour is likely to result in an inferior performance of the estimated policy. We reuse inspiration from the reinforcement learning community and relax the greedy operator used in SOC with an information theoretic bound that limits the `distance' of two subsequent trajectory distributions in a policy update. The introduced bound ensures a smooth and stable policy update. Our method is also well suited for model-based reinforcement learning, where we estimate the system dynamics model from data. As this model is likely to be inaccurate, it might be dangerous to exploit the model greedily. Instead, our bound ensures that we generate new data in the vicinity of the current data, such that we can improve our estimate of the system dynamics model. We show that our approach outperforms several state of the art approaches on challenging simulated robot control tasks.",

In particular, we focus on process algebra as a language to specify complex task specifications motivated by autonomous electric vehicles operating in a mobility-on-demand scenario. We use ideas from sampling-based motion-planning algorithms to incrementally construct a finite abstraction of the dynamical system as a Kripke structure. Given a task specification expressed as a process graph, we use model checking techniques to construct a weighted product graph of the specification with the Kripke structure. We then devise an algorithm that provably converges to the optimal trajectory of the dynamical system that satisfies the task specification as the number of the states in the Kripke structure goes to infinity. The algorithm is demonstrated in simulation experiments, viz., charging the electric car at a busy charging station and scheduling pick-ups and drop-offs of passengers.",

We present a method for generating configurations using reachable volumes that is applicable to various types of robots including open and closed chain robots, tree-like robots, and complex robots including both loops and branches. We also describe how to apply constraints (both on end effectors and internal joints) using reachable volumes. Unlike previous methods, reachable volumes work for spherical and prismatic joints as well as planar joints. Visualizations of reachable volumes can allow an operator to see what positions the robot can reach and can guide robot design. We present visualizations of reachable volumes for representative robots including closed chains and graspers as well as for examples with joint and end effector constraints.",

It first introduces an adapted metric to cope with the deformations involved by the catadioptric sensor, and that is conformal with the ground 2D-metric.

Among these, cell segregation is of particular interest since it plays an important role in the formation of tissues, organs, and living organisms. The Differential Adhesion Hypothesis states that cells naturally segregate because of differences in affinity, which lead similar cells to strongly adhere to each other. By exploring this principle, we propose a controller that can segregate a heterogeneous swarm of robots according to the characteristics of each agent, such that similar robots form homogeneous teams and dissimilar robots are segregated. We apply LaSalle's Invariance Principle to show convergence and perform simulated experiments in order to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed controller. Results show that our approach allows a swarm of multiple heterogeneous robots to segregate in a coherent and smooth fashion, without any inter-agent collisions.",

        "abstract": "Estimating human poses is an important step towards developing robots that can understand human motion. Since a human is highly articulated, changing viewpoints of sensors on robots can improve the accuracy of human-pose estimation. We propose a two-phase approach that determines the best viewpoint of a depth sensor for human-pose estimation. The proposed approach measures the quality of potential viewpoints and selects one of them as the best viewpoint for each human pose. Based on the quality of viewpoints, human poses can be directly mapped to the best viewpoint without reconstructing the human body. Thus, the proposed approach provides a discriminative mapping to determine the best viewpoint for estimating different human poses. To measure the quality of a potential viewpoint, the viewpoint is first instantiated by representing the depth sensor of the viewpoint using the finite projective camera model. The quality of the viewpoint is expressed in terms of the error of humanpose estimates. A mapping is derived by minimizing the error in a human-pose estimate among different viewpoints. The proposed two-phase approach has been evaluated on a benchmark database. Experimental results showed that the best viewpoint for a human pose could be determined by evaluating the quality of potential viewpoints. The mean error and standard deviation of human-pose estimates were reduced by using the best viewpoint determined by the proposed two-phase approach.",

        "abstract": "Self-assembled structures and machines can be made using origami-inspired manufacturing methods. In particular, self-folding of two-dimensional materials using shape memory polymers and embedded electrical circuits has been utilized to build robots and structures in an inexpensive and rapid manner. In order to build increasingly complex and functional self-folding machines, however, methods for interaction with the environment are necessary. This paper presents and characterizes three types of self-folding sensors: a mechanical switch, a capacitive contact sensor, and a velocity sensor. We utilize specialized fold patterns to create cyclic mechanical linkages as well as additional composite layers such as magnetic sheets to build these sensors. We demonstrate the integration of two of these sensors, the switch and the contact sensor, into a lamp that can self-fold and immediately begin responding to its surroundings.",

Each container is a robotic module capable of holonomic motion that can dock in a brick pattern to form arbitrary shapes. Over 60 modules were built of varying capability. The docking mechanism is designed to be robust to large disturbances that can be expected in the high seas. The docking mechanism also incorporates adjustable stiffness so that the conglomerate can comply to waves representative of sea state three, and have the ability to dynamically stiffen as required. The component modules for autonomous assembly, docking and simultaneous collision-free planning as well as the software architecture are presented along with the description of experimental verification.",

For printing functional structures for robotic use, we realize electric circuitry based on metallic polyester film (MPF). By exploiting the unique material properties of MPF, we developed fundamental electric devices, namely a resistor, capacitor, and inductor. The developed polyvinyl chloride laminated MPF sheet shows reliable self-folding processes under a heat application, and it configures 3D electric devices. Due to the pre-resolved kinematic design, these devices feature elasticity, making them suitable as sensors and actuators in soft circuits. Here we testify to a self-assembled variable resistor and capacitive strain sensor. An actuation mechanism consisting of a folded contractible coil is also considered and shown. Finally, an RLC circuit obtained from the integration of all the developed devices is demonstrated, in which the coil based actuator is controlled by reading a variable capacitive strain sensor.",

        "abstract": "Reduction of the system complexity is currently one of the main challenges for efficient and versatile legged robot locomotion. In this paper, we present a new one legged hopping robot called CHIARO, which is equipped with a curved foot. Even though the robot has no sensory feedback and consists of only two rigid bodies and one spring loaded joint with parallel actuation, it is able to achieve stable forward-hopping over a wide range of parameters and forward-speeds. Operating at natural hopping frequency, the parallel actuation shows good efficiency. This paper presents an approach to determine stability and efficiency of a highly non-linear mechanical system. By implementing a two dimensional numerical model, taking into account ground contact forces by a Newtonian kinematic impact- and coulomb friction law, we conducted a thorough parameter analysis based on a series of simulations. The comparison of the simulation and real world experiments shows good accordance, which qualifies the simulation for parameter optimization including prediction of robot stability and efficiency.",

In this paper, we address the problem of semantic labeling 3D point clouds by object affordance (e.g., `pushable', `liftable'). We propose a technique to extract geometric features from point cloud segments and build a classifier to predict associated object affordances. With the classifier, we have developed an algorithm to enhance object segmentation and reduce manipulation uncertainty by iterative clustering, along with minimizing labeling entropy. Our incremental multiple view merging technique shows improved object segmentation. The novel feature of our approach is the semantic labeling that can be directly applied to manipulation planning. In our experiments with 6 affordance labels, an average of 81.8% accuracy of affordance prediction is achieved. We demonstrate refined object segmentation by applying the classifier to data from the PR2 robot using a Microsoft Kinect in an indoor office environment.",

        "abstract": "We propose a new approach to semantic parsing, which can seamlessly integrate evidence from multiple sensors with overlapping but possibly different fields of view (FOV), account for missing data and predict semantic labels over the spatial union of sensors coverages. The existing approaches typically carry out semantic segmentation using only one modality, incorrectly interpolate measurements of other modalities or at best assign semantic labels only to the spatial intersection of coverages of different sensors. In this work we remedy these problems by proposing an effective and efficient strategy for inducing the graph structure of Conditional Random Field used for inference and a novel method for computing the sensor domain dependent potentials. We focus on RGB cameras and 3D data from lasers or depth sensors. The proposed approach achieves superior performance, compared to state of the art and obtains labels for the union of spatial coverages of both sensors, while effectively using appearance or 3D cues when they are available. The efficiency of the approach is amenable to realtime implementation. We quantitatively validate our proposal in two publicly available datasets from indoors and outdoors real environments. The obtained semantic understanding of the acquired sensory information can enable higher level tasks for autonomous mobile robots and facilitate semantic mapping of the environments.",

The path is represented as a B-spline and the human operator can modify its shape by controlling the motion of a finite number of control points. An autonomous algorithm corrects in real time the human directives in order to facilitate path tracking for the mobile robot and ensures i) collision avoidance, ii) path regularity, and iii) attraction to nearby points of interest. A haptic feedback algorithm processes both human's and autonomous control terms, and their integrals, to provide an information of the mismatch between the path specified by the operator and the one corrected by the autonomous algorithm. The framework is validated with extensive experiments using a quadrotor UAV and a human in the loop with two haptic interfaces.",

        "abstract": "Mobile manipulation targets applications in dynamic and unstructured environments. Motion generation methods suitable for these applications must account for end-effector task constraints, must reason about environment uncertainty, i.e. the fact that the exact state of the dynamic environment cannot be known to the robot, and should do so only using their on-board sensors. We present the Expected-Shortest-Path Elastic Roadmap (ESPER) planner as a motion generation method suitable for mobile manipulation. It integrates task-constrained, whole-body, reactive motion generation in high-dimensional configuration space with reasoning about uncertainty. In our experiments, we generate task-consistent motion in uncertain environments on a real-world mobile manipulator only relying on on-board sensors.",

        "abstract": "Microscale robots offer an unprecedented opportunity to perform tasks at resolutions approaching 1 \u03bcm, but the great majority of research to this point focuses on actuation and control. Potential applications for microrobots can be considerably expanded by integrating sensing, signal processing and feedback into the system. In this work, we demonstrate that technologies from the field of synthetic biology may be directly integrated into microrobotic systems to create cell-based programmable mobile sensors, with signal processors and memory units. Specifically, we integrate genetically engineered, ultraviolet light-sensing bacteria with magnetic microrobots, creating the first controllable biological microrobot that is capable of exploring, recording and reporting on the state of the microscale environment. We demonstrate two proof-of-concept prototypes: (a) an integrated microrobot platform that is able to sense biochemical signals, and (b) a microrobot platform that is able to deploy biosensor payloads to monitor biochemical signals, both in a biological environment. These results have important implications for integrated micro-bio-robotic systems for applications in biological engineering and research.",

The robot's form factor is a convex, hemispheric shell containing trackballs for sensing touch, and LEDs for communication with users. In this paper, we explore tactile sensory decoding by constructing a spiking neural network (SNN) of somatosensory cortex. The SNN uses a biologically inspired, unsupervised learning rule, known as spike timing dependent plasticity, to classify a user's hand movements. In an evaluation of the network's ability to categorize hand movements, both rate and temporal neural coding performed well. Because of its unique form factor and means of interaction, this robot, which is called CARL-SJR, may be useful for exploring the neural coding of touch, and also for Human-Robot Interaction studies.",

The experiment in this paper shows that for small budget sizes the new algorithm performs at least as well as other methods. However the new algorithm does not exhaust its sampling budget by default and thus needs to be modified to outperform other approaches for large sample budgets, which provides opportunity for future work in this area.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel set-point control method of a musculoskeletal system by combining a feedforward and feedback manner to complement each drawback each other. In our previous work, a feedforward positioning method of the musculoskeletal arm model was proposed which does not need any realtime sensory information. Its performance, however, depends on a muscular arrangement and an attitude of the arm, and thereby a large initial muscular internal force is necessary to make a good performance. On the other hand, it is well-known that a visual servoing is effective and versatile for the set-point control. However, there is a considerable time-delay due to a computational burden to acquire useful information from an image and an insufficient sampling period to capture each image when using a video frame rate camera. Thus in this paper, the feedforward and feedback signal are linearly combined into one in order to mutually complement each drawback. The combined control signal is newly designed and then numerical simulation results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed method.",

At the heart of the localisation is the fundamental task of discovering feature correspondences between recorded and live images. One aspect of this problem involves deciding where to look for correspondences in an image and the second is deciding what to look for. This latter point, which is the main focus of our paper, requires understanding how and why the appearance of visual features can change over time. In particular, such knowledge allows us to better deal with abrupt and challenging changes in lighting. We show how by instantiating a parallel image processing stream which operates on illumination-invariant images, we can substantially improve the performance of an outdoor visual navigation system. We will demonstrate, explain and analyse the effect of the RGB to illumination-invariant transformation and suggest that for little cost it becomes a viable tool for those concerned with having robots operate for long periods outdoors.",

The driver commands a preferred velocity which is transformed into a collision-free local motion that respects the actuator constraints and allows for smooth and safe control. Collision-free local motions are achieved with an extension of velocity obstacles that takes into account dynamic constraints and a grid-based map representation. To limit the freedom of the driver, a global guidance trajectory can be included, which specifies the areas where the vehicle is allowed to drive in each time instance. The low computational complexity of the method makes it well suited for multi-agent settings and high update rates and both a centralized and a distributed algorithm are provided that allow for real-time control of tens of vehicles. Extensive experimental results with real robotic wheelchairs at relatively high speeds in tight scenarios are presented.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of finding shortest paths through 3-dimensional cluttered environments. In particular, an algorithm is presented that determines the shortest path between two points in an environment with obstacles which can be implemented on robots with capabilities of detecting obstacles in the environment. As knowledge of the environment is increasing while the vehicle moves around, the algorithm provides not only the global minimizer \u2014 or shortest path \u2014 with increasing probability as time goes by, but also provides a series of local minimizers. The feasibility of the algorithm is demonstrated on a quadrotor robot flying in an environment with obstacles.",

Each cell, which might be considered a \u201cmuscle unit\u201d, consists of a contractile Nitinol SMA core with conductive terminals. Large numbers of these cells might be combined and externally powered to change phase, contracting to either articulate with a large strain or increase the stiffness of the ensemble, depending on the cell design. Unlike traditional work in modular robotics, the approach presented here focuses on cells that have a simplistic design and function, are inexpensive to fabricate, and are eventually scalable to sub-millimeter sizes, working towards our vision of robot structures that can be custom-fabricated from large numbers of general cell units, similar to biological structures.",

However, multi-fingered grasping imposes a formidable control challenge due to the high dimensionality of the joint space and the difficulty to form a functional grip on objects. We propose a hybrid technique based on grasping synergies extracted from kinaesthetic demonstrations on a given object with a primitive geometry \u2014 a cuboid in this case \u2014 and passive kinematic enveloping as a generalization technique. Experiments were carried out on an iCub humanoid robot using everyday objects such as a telephone receiver, a computer mouse, three white board markers bundled together, a fencing handle, a compact disc keep case, and a drinking glass. We prove that the primitives extracted from kinaesthetic demonstrations on a cuboid can be generalized across a majority of the above real world objects.",

The control method has been developed for performing multiple tasks: end-point motion control and vibration suppression control of a flexible appendage. A simple dynamic model that considers coupling between the manipulator and the flexible appendage is proposed for the control method. The tasks are performed simultaneously on the basis of their order of priorities using a redundant manipulator. Additionally, because vibration suppression requires feedback of the state of the flexible appendage, a state estimator of the appendage using a force/torque sensor is developed. Finally, the proposed model, control method, and state estimator were verified experimentally using an air-floating system.",

Our system can acquire 512\u00d7512 depth images in real time at 500 fps. The depth image processing is accelerated by installing a GPU board for parallel processing of a gray-code structured light method using infrared (IR) light patterns projected from an IR projector. Using the computed depth images, suitable RGB light patterns to be projected are generated in real time for enhanced application tasks. They are projected from an RGB projector as augmented information onto a 3-D scene with pixel-wise correspondence even when the 3-D scene is time-varied. Experimental results obtained from enhanced application tasks for time-varying 3-D scenes such as (1) depth-based color mapping and (2) augmented reality (AR) spirit level, confirm the efficacy of our system.",

Therefore, robust prototype extraction from the noisy sample set is highly expected to help traffic sign recognition in video sequence.

The new model accounts for not only the reconstruction capability and the sparsity, but also the robustness. To solve the optimization problem, we adopt the Alternating Directional Method of Multiplier (ADMM) technology to design an iterative algorithm.

This paper describes a novel method for the simultaneous underwater image quality assessment, visibility enhancement and disparity computation to increase stereo range resolution under dynamic, natural lighting and turbid conditions. The technique estimates the visibility properties from a sparse 3D map of the original degraded image using a physical underwater light attenuation model. Firstly, an iterated distance-adaptive image contrast enhancement enables a dense disparity computation and visibility estimation. Secondly, using a light attenuation model for ocean water, a color corrected stereo underwater image is obtained along with a visibility distance estimate. Experimental results in shallow, naturally lit, high-turbidity coastal environments show the proposed technique improves range estimation over the original images as well as image quality and color for habitat classification. Furthermore, the recursiveness and robustness of the technique allows implementation onboard an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle for improving navigation and obstacle avoidance performance.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies three-dimensional multi-robot Cooperative Localization (CL) problem. Most of existing CL strategies adopt Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or Maximum a Posteriori (MAP). In this paper, a novel approach based on Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) is proposed. The main contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) MHE is integrated with EKF for three-dimensional CL using single mobile beacon, which can bound localization error, impose various constraints on states and noises, and make use of previous range measurements for current estimation. 2) A sufficient condition on observability of multi-robot CL is derived by using Fisher Information Matrix. Simulation is conducted to verify that the proposed MHE based CL algorithm outperforms EKF based method in terms of localization accuracy, and two scenarios where our algorithm is superior to EKF are discussed.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel approach for detecting objects and estimating their 3D pose in single images of cluttered scenes. Objects are given in terms of 3D models without accompanying texture cues. A deformable parts-based model is trained on clusters of silhouettes of similar poses and produces hypotheses about possible object locations at test time. Objects are simultaneously segmented and verified inside each hypothesis bounding region by selecting the set of superpixels whose collective shape matches the model silhouette. A final iteration on the 6-DOF object pose minimizes the distance between the selected image contours and the actual projection of the 3D model. We demonstrate successful grasps using our detection and pose estimate with a PR2 robot. Extensive evaluation with a novel ground truth dataset shows the considerable benefit of using shape-driven cues for detecting objects in heavily cluttered scenes.",

We show that a general framework for search can be derived from frontier-based exploration, but exploration strategies for selection of a next goal to which navigate a robot cannot be simply reused. We present three goal selection strategies (greedy, traveling salesmen based, and traveling deliveryman based) and statistically evaluate and discuss their performance for search in comparison to exploration.",

Instead of the conventional approach of having cascaded control loops, the proposed controller directly regulates the commanded torques to stabilize the attitude and lateral position in a single loop. The method is verified by performing trajectory following flights with the insectlike robot. The results show that the position errors during trajectory following flights are comparable to those observed from steady hovering flights.",

Teleoperated flexible endoscopes are an emerging technology to promote participation in these preventive screenings. Real-time pose estimation is therefore essential to enable feedback to the robotic endoscope's control system. Vision-based endoscope localization approaches are a promising avenue, since they do not require extra sensors on board the endoscopes. In this work, we compare several state-of-the-art algorithms for computing the image motion (optical flow), which is then used with a supervised learning strategy to provide an accurate estimate of the 6 degree of freedom endoscope motion. The method is validated using a robotically actuated endoscope in a human colon simulator, and represents a preliminary effort towards testing with clinical video data.",

By adding two canes held by hands, the supporting region and stability margin are enlarged in comparison with biped walking. We first study the mechanism of cane-assisted walking by human beings. Based on the study, we develop two ski-type gaits, Crawl_1 and Craw-2, respectively for the humanoid robot Hubo. The stability performance for the two configurations is compared, which leads to the adoption of the Crawl_2 gait. Furthermore the length of the canes is selected to support a feasible while stable Crawl_2 gait. Finally simulation and experiments are performed to verify the new ski-type gait.",

These robot skins are different in various aspects: the sensing modality, interconnectivity of the sensors, modularity, the communication network, etc. This variety limits portability of software among these robot skins. In this article, a middleware is proposed that is capable of interacting in principle with any robot skin, through the use of simple drivers. Primarily, the middleware acquires data in real-time and provides its applications with those data in an abstract structure. As a result, the portability of algorithms implemented for large-scale tactile data processing is greatly increased among various available and future robot skins.",

        "abstract": "Most wheelchairs have low directional stability due to their wheel-drive system configurations. Hence, when a wheelchair experiences excessive slip, it will create an uncontrollable moment that changes its heading direction, endangering the safety of the wheelchair user. This paper presents an approach to longitudinal slip reduction (or traction control) for an Electric Powered Wheelchair that uses a variable reference model, which is a mass-damper system. The position of a joystick is mapped to force and torque values, which are the input to this model. The output is the desired trajectory, which is fed to a trajectory tracking controller. The key idea is that if slip occurs, the applied torque to the wheels is reduced by decreasing the desired acceleration, which is achieved by changing the parameters of the reference model. In this study, the mass of the reference model is changed. The proposed slip reduction approach is validated via experiments.",

        "abstract": "This paper specifies and evaluates the accuracy of the Smart Tissue Anastomosis Robot (STAR). The STAR is a proof of concept vision-guided robotic system equipped with an actuated laparoscopic suturing tool and a multispectral vision system. The STAR supports image-based suturing commands and is capable of detecting near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) markers that provide reliable visual segmentation and tracking. The paper reports the best case scenario accuracy specifications of the STAR as derived from its configuration and calibration parameters. We also evaluate experimentally the effects of overlaying NIRF markers on the accuracy of the STAR when these markers are used as the source of image-based commands and we compare these results to the accuracy of the STAR with image-based commands generated from plain color images. Our results demonstrate that the STAR is able to place sutures on a planar phantom with an average accuracy of 0.5 mm with a standard deviation of 0.2 mm and that NIRF markers have no statistically significant adverse effect on the accuracy.",

Rotary encoders that measure joint angles of a multi-fingered hand must be of very small size and yet provide reliable and repetitive data. Hall-effect sensors combined with ring magnets fit in narrow spaces and have proved to be durable rotary magnetic position sensors due to their contact-less features. However, when several sensors of this kind are packed closely together in a finger, magnetic crosstalk effects appear and can lead to important errors/shifts in nearby sensor readings. This paper describes magnetic crosstalk effects in nearby joints and proposes a compensation method directly linked with the software calibration process.",

A key limitation of such algorithms is the difficulty in incorporating constraints and cost functions that explicitly depend on time. We present T-CHOMP, a functional gradient algorithm that overcomes this limitation by directly optimizing in space-time. We outline a framework for joint space-time optimization, derive an efficient trajectory-wide update for maintaining time monotonicity, and demonstrate the significance of T-CHOMP over CHOMP in several scenarios. By manipulating time, T-CHOMP produces lower-cost trajectories leading to behavior that is meaningfully different from CHOMP.",

While many PRM sampling methods have been proposed to increase the proportion of samples within narrow passages, such difficult planning areas still pose many challenges. We introduce a novel algorithm, Spark PRM, that sparks the growth of Rapidly-expanding Random Trees (RRTs) from narrow passage samples generated by a PRM. The RRT rapidly generates further narrow passage samples, ideally until the passage is fully mapped. After reaching a terminating condition, the tree stops growing and is added to the roadmap. Spark PRM is a general method that can be applied to all PRM variants. We study the benefits of Spark PRM with a variety of sampling strategies in a wide array of environments. We show significant speedups in computation time over RRT, Sampling-based Roadmap of Trees (SRT), and various PRM variants.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new approach to mobile robot mapping in long-term scenarios. So far, the environment models used in mobile robotics have been tailored to capture static scenes and dealt with the environment changes by means of `memory decay'. While these models keep up with slowly changing environments, their utilization in dynamic, real world environments is difficult. The representation proposed in this paper models the environment's spatio-temporal dynamics by its frequency spectrum. The spectral representation of the time domain allows to identify, analyse and remember regularly occurring environment processes in a computationally efficient way. Knowledge of the periodicity of the different environment processes constitutes the model predictive capabilities, which are especially useful for long-term mobile robotics scenarios. In the experiments presented, the proposed approach is applied to data collected by a mobile robot patrolling an indoor environment over a period of one week. Three scenarios are investigated, including intruder detection and 4D mapping. The results indicate that the proposed method allows to represent arbitrary timescales with constant (and low) memory requirements, achieving compression rates up to 106. Moreover, the representation allows for prediction of future environment states with ~ 90% precision.",

However, most existing vision systems can only provide ball's position observation, and do not take into consideration the spin of the ball, which is very important in competitions. This paper proposes a way to observe and estimate ball's spin in real-time, and achieve an accurate prediction. Based on the fact that a spinning ball's motion can be separated into global movement and spinning respect to its center, we construct an integrated vision system to observe the two motions separately. With a pan-tilt vision system, the spinning motion is observed through recognizing the position of the brand on the ball and restoring the 3D pose of the ball. Then the spin state is estimated with the method of plane fitting on current and historical observations. With both position and spin information, accurate state estimation and trajectory prediction are realized via Extended Kalman Filter(EKF). Experimental results show the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes the method independent of numerical integration for analyzing the stability of a limit cycle walker that falls down as a 1-DOF rigid body in the same posture. We introduce the model of an underactuated rimless wheel with a torso for analysis and show that the transition function of the state error can be analytically derived from the recurrence formula of kinetic energy immediately before impact. We then investigate the accuracy of the derived solution through comparison with the numerical solutions and discuss how the convergence property changes with respect to the control parameter. Furthermore, we extend the method to an underactuated biped and show that the stability analysis can be conducted in a similar manner without performing numerical simulations.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents periodic solutions for a quadrocopter maintaining a height around a position in space despite having lost a single, two opposing, or three propellers. In each case the control strategy consists of the quadrocopter spinning about a primary axis, fixed with respect to the vehicle, and tilting this axis for translational control. A linear, timeinvariant description of deviations from the attitude equilibrium is derived, allowing for a convenient cascaded control design. The results for the cases of losing one and two propellers are validated in experiment, while the case of losing three propellers is validated in a nonlinear simulation. These results have application in multicopter fault-tolerant control design, and also point to possible design directions for novel flying vehicles.",

        "abstract": "Microscale teleoperation with haptic feedback requires scaling gains in the order of 104 \u2212107. These high gains impose a trade-off between stability and transparency. Due to the conservative approach used in most designs, transparency is reduced since damping is added to the system to guarantee stability. Starting from the fact that series, negative feedback and parallel connection of passive systems is a passive system, a new approach is addressed in this work. We propose here a complete teleoperation chain designed from the ground up for full transparency and stability, including a novel self-sensing probe and a high fidelity force-feedback haptic interface. By guaranteeing the passivity of each device and assuming that the human operator and the environment are passive systems, a homothetic direct coupling can be used without jeopardizing the stability and provides best transparency. The system is experimentally demonstrated in the complex case of a probe interacting with a water droplet under human control, while accurately transcribing the interaction back to operator.",

By clustering polygon models of a finger and an object, the contact area between a finger and an object is obtained as the common area between an object cluster and a finger cluster. Then, by assuming the Winkler elastic foundation, the pressure distribution within the contact area is obtained. By using this pressure distribution, we show that we can judge grasp stability under soft-finger contact. We further consider defining a quality measure of a soft-finger grasp by assuming that although the gravitational force is applied to an object, the direction of gravity is unknown. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we show several numerical examples.",

        "abstract": "A large category model base can provide object-level knowledge for various perception tasks of the intelligent vehicle system. The automatic and efficient construction of such a model base is highly desirable but challenging. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised approach to discover possible prototype models of 3D object structures from the point cloud of a large and complex environment, given a limited number of seeds in an object category. Our method incrementally trains the models while simultaneously collecting object samples. Considering the bias problem of model learning caused by bias accumulation in a sample collection, we propose to gradually differentiate the standard category model into several sub-category models to represent different intra-category structural styles. Thus, new sub-categories are discovered and modeled, old models are improved, and redundant models for similar structures are deleted iteratively during the learning process. This multiple-model strategy provides several interactive options for the category boundary to deal with the bias problem. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and high efficiency of our approach to model mining from \u201cbig point cloud data\u201d.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the shape of a planar elastic rod (e.g., a thin flexible strip of metal) using images of the rod. This is done by treating configurations of the elastic rod as solutions of a geometric optimal control problem. The necessary conditions for optimality provide coordinates over which to perform inference, and the sufficient conditions provide the gradient of the shape of the rod with respect to these coordinates. This optimal control formulation allows for configurations of the rod to be represented as points in a finite-dimensional space without having to discretize the shape of the rod. We consider the estimation problem with and without fiducial markers attached to the rod. Results from both simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate the ability of our approach to track the shape of a deforming elastic rod.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel analytical approach to computing the population and geometric parameters of a multi-robot system that will provably produce specified boundary coverage statistics. We consider scenarios in which robots with no global position information, communication, or prior environmental data have arrived at uniformly random locations along a simple closed or open boundary. This type of scenario can arise in a variety of multi-robot tasks, including surveillance, collective transport, disaster response, and therapeutic and imaging applications in nanomedicine. We derive the probability that a given point robot configuration is saturated, meaning that all pairs of adjacent robots are no farther apart than a specified distance. This derivation relies on a geometric interpretation of the saturation probability and an application of the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, and it is easily extended to finite-sized robots. In the process, we obtain formulas for (a) an integral that is in general computationally expensive to compute directly, and (b) the volume of the intersection of a regular simplex with a hypercube. In addition, we use results from order statistics to compute the probability distributions of the robot positions along the boundary and the distances between adjacent robots. We validate our derivations of these probability distributions and the saturation probability using Monte Carlo simulations of scenarios with both point robots and finite-sized robots.",

        "abstract": "Food processing provides a lot of possibilities to apply robotics and automation. In this paper, we identify disordered and ordered states of discrete food products. The concept of Degree of Disarray is introduced. Food ordering processes such as vibratory feeders, multi-head weighers, pick and place operations are common automation in food industry to transfer products from a higher to a lower Degree of Disarray. Parts entropy is introduced to describe a product's individual state based on the symmetry categorisation. A macroscopic transitional model is presented which determines a subspace of the disordered arrangement using the eigenvectors of the largest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. A projection into this created subspace follows. As soon as the disorder state in only one dimension is achieved, the point of disorder can be derived which finally transfers the objects into order. From here, a transformation to any order arrangement in any dimension is possible. This methodology is applied to pick and place operations and experiments are conducted.",

        "abstract": "We address obstacle avoidance for outdoor flight of micro air vehicles. The highly textured nature of outdoor scenes enables camera-based perception, which will scale to very small size, weight, and power with very wide, two-axis field of regard. In this paper, we use forward-looking stereo cameras for obstacle detection and a downward-looking camera as an input to state estimation. For obstacle representation, we use image space with the stereo disparity map itself. We show that a C-space-like obstacle expansion can be done with this representation and that collision checking can be done by projecting candidate 3-D trajectories into image space and performing a z-buffer-like operation with the disparity map. This approach is very efficient in memory and computing time. We do motion planning and trajectory generation with an adaptation of a closed-loop RRT planner to quadrotor dynamics and full 3D search. We validate the performance of the system with Monte Carlo simulations in virtual worlds and flight tests of a real quadrotor through a grove of trees. The approach is designed to support scalability to high speed flight and has numerous possible generalizations to use other polar or hybrid polar/Cartesian representations and to fuse data from additional sensors, such as peripheral optical flow or radar.",

The elasticity is introduced via springs connected in series with non-extensible cables. The benefit of such series elastic cables include tension control without using force sensors and tension redistribution. However, elasticity also reduces positioning accuracy and makes the system more prone to disturbances. Therefore, careful stiffness modulation is needed for better performance. We exploit the configuration redundancy in mobile cable robots to optimize certain desired task space stiffness criterion. Both simulation and experimental results are presented for validation.",

A structural optimization method, termed the mechanism-based approach, is used to identify the optimal topology and shape of the flexure mechanisms based on their lump stiffness characteristics. Using several different fitness functions, several optimal flexure designs have been synthesized for use in millimeter-scale mobile grippers (\u03bc-grippers). The stiffness characteristics of the optimal \u03bc-grippers are shown to be better than the thin-beam designs developed using human intuition. Two large-scale prototypes are constructed and experiments are conducted to validate the stiffness analysis. The experimental results are within 20% of the analytical expectations. As a proof of concept, at-scale \u03bc-grippers are constructed based on photolithography and replica molding methods, and demonstrated in simple actuation. The optimal \u03bc-grippers can be applicable for cell manipulations in future works.",

The actuator considered in this paper was developed and described in [1] and [2]. This actuator offers high torque-to-mass and torque-to-inertia ratios, for inherent safe actuation. While the antagonistic arrangement is beneficial in improving the actuator performance and eliminating backlash, it may result in limit cycles when the actuator operates in a position control loop. The occurrence of limit cycle depends on the parameters of the actuator as well as the controller. An in-depth analysis is carried out in this paper to establish a connection between the system parameters and the limit cycle occurrence. Moreover, sufficient conditions for avoiding limit cycle are derived specifically for a Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller. Simulations and experimental results validate the analysis and provide insights into the limit cycle observed in the operation of antagonistic MR actuators.",

In this article, we show why the injury onset is appropriate to limit the consequences of human-robot collisions, and how this onset can be quantified through collision tests with live test subjects.

        "abstract": "A new type of wearable robot that assists the wearer with extra arms secured around the hips is presented. Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL) can hold objects, clamp them to a fixture, guide and support human hands, and assist the wearer in performing a task as a close co-worker. This paper focuses on a class of tasks where SRL physically interacts with the environment through contact. SRL makes contact with a wall and thereby braces the human body against the environment. SRL also guides the human hands by placing a drill jig over the drilling location. Bracing the human body and guiding the hands, SRL can enhance the drilling task stability and accuracy. The SRL technology is applied to aircraft assembly, where conventional industrial robots failed to perform effectively. First, the basic design concept of SRL is summarized, and task strategies using SRL and their functional requirements are described. Kinematic and static properties resulting from the structural closed loops formed around the SRL, the human, and the environment are analyzed, and effective strategies for physical disturbance rejection and fine positioning are discussed. A prototype robotic arm grasps the aircraft fuselage structure. Another robotic arm places a drill jig precisely on the fuselage structure, and guides and stabilizes a hand drill held by the human user. An optimization method is developed in order to identify the SRL kinematic configuration and joint torques that stabilize the drill and at the same time minimize the human workload.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method based on inverse kinematics with task specification for online human to humanoid motion imitation. We particularly focus on the problem of lifting and placing feet on the floor during the motion, allowing change of support during stepping or locomotion. The approach avoids the use of motion primitives that limit the robot motions to what had been learned. A direct transposition of movements is generated, allowing the robot to move freely in space as the human model does, at a velocity close to the reference one. The approach is validated on the humanoid robot NAO and shows very promising results for the use of online motion imitation.",

        "abstract": "Maintaining humanoid robot stability in unstructured environments is nontrivial because robots lack humanlike tactile sensing and require complex task-specific controllers to integrate information from multiple sensors. To deploy humanoid robots in cluttered and unstructured environments such as disaster sites, it is necessary to develop advanced techniques in both locomotion and control. This paper proposes to incorporate a pair of actuated smart staffs with vision and force sensing that transforms biped humanoids into tripeds or quadrupeds or more generally, SupraPeds. The concept of SuprePeds not only improves the stability of humanoid robots while traversing rough terrain but also retains the manipulation capabilities. In order to control the potentially numerous contact forces on SupraPeds, we develop a friction-consistent whole-body control framework that implements generic multi-contact control for arbitrary humanoids, which enables autonomous balancing while complying with friction constraints. The simulation results are presented to demonstrate that the proposed control framework can efficiently deal with multi-contact locomotion in 3D unstructured environments.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Aiming at the robot drilling perpendicularity in aircraft assembly, a surface normal measurement method is presented and a drilling end effector is designed. Four laser ranging sensors are uniformly distributed around the drill to measure the surface normal as four non-coplanar points define a unique circumscribed sphere and the sphere center can be calculated. By this principle, the method measures four points coordinates on the curved surface in the drilling area using four laser ranging sensors. If the four laser ranging sensors are close enough to each other, it is reasonable to assume that the drilling point is on the sphere surface. Therefore, the connection line of the sphere center and the drilling point is the surface normal at the drilling point. The angle \u03b8 between the normal and the axis of the drill is calculated and if \u03b8 is larger than 0.5 degree, the drilling end effector will adjust the attitude of the drill to make sure \u03b8 is smaller than 0.5 degree to meet the requirement in aircraft assembly. A novel adjusting mechanism is designed in the end effector which can keep drill vertex immobile when adjusting drill position. Thus, it is not required to remove the drill vertex to the mark point. Simulation results of three kinds curved surfaces show that the surface normal measurement method is accurate and efficient. Experiments on aviation drilling system results also demonstrate the adjusting mechanism is effective with high accuracy.",

        "abstract": "HD Video from the (monocular or binocular) endoscopic camera provides a rich real-time sensing channel from surgical site to the surgeon console in various Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) procedures. However, a real-time framework for video understanding would be critical for tapping into the rich information-content provided by the non-invasive and well-established digital endoscopic video-streaming modality. While contemporary research focuses on enhancing aspects such as tool-tracking within the challenging visual scenes, we consider the associated problem of using that rich (but often compromised) streaming visual data to discover the underlying semantic attributes of the tools. Directly analyzing the surgical videos to extract more realistic attributes online can aid in the decision-making and feedback aspects. We propose a novel probabilistic attribute labelling framework with Bayesian filtering to identify associated semantics (open/closed, stained with blood etc.) to ultimately give semantic feedback to the surgeon. Our robust video-understanding framework overcomes many of the challenges (tissue deformations, image specularities, clutter, tool-occlusion due to blood and/or organs) under realistic in-vivo surgical conditions. Specifically, this manuscript performs rigorous experimental analysis of the resulting method with varying parameters and different visual features on a data-corpus consisting of real surgical procedures performed on patients with da Vinci Surgical System [9].",

The presented approach based on a visual relative localization of swarm particles is designed for utilization of multi-robot teams in real-world dynamic environments. The core of the swarming behaviour is inspired by Reynold's BOID model proposed for 2D simulations of schooling behaviour of fish. The idea of the simple BOID model, with three simple rules: Separation, Alignment and Cohesion, is extended for swarms of quadrotors in this paper. The proposed solution integrates the swarming behaviour with the relative localization and with a stabilization and control mechanism, which respects fast dynamics of unmanned quadrotors. The proposed method aspires to be an enabling technique for deployment of swarms of micro areal vehicles outside laboratories that are equipped with precise positioning systems. The swarming behaviour as well as the possibility of swarm stabilization with the visual relative localization in the control feedback are verified by simulations and partly by an experiment with quadrotors in this paper.",

MTL is a popular logic that allows to specify timed properties of real-time reactive systems and hence is appropriate for describing the safe and autonomous operations of robotic systems in an uncertain and possibly adversarial environment. We provide constructive means for computing finite-state abstractions that preserve MTL properties for nonlinear systems, under a weak assumption that these nonlinear systems evolve continuously with respect to their initial conditions. We then provide conditions to ensure that the existence of a discrete strategy (obtained by solving a discrete synthesis problem) guarantees the existence of a switching strategy for controlling the continuous-time dynamical systems to satisfy a given MTL specification. We illustrate the results on a motion planning problem.",

The proposed approach relaxes constraints on the simultaneous and interleaved motion of the robots, while maintaining constraints on their relative location to guarantee collision-avoidance and prevent deadlock.

In this paper we present a dynamic analysis and system identification for the complete actuator unit of a cable robot including servo controller, winch, cable, cable force sensor and field bus communication. We establish a second-order system with dead time as an analagous model. Based on this investigation, we propose the design and stability analysis of a cable force controller. We present the implementation of feed-forward and integral controllers based on a stiffness model of the cables. As the platform position is not observable the challenge is to control the cable force while maintaining the positional accuracy. Experimental evaluation of the force controller shows, that the absolute positional accuracy is even improved.",

Hence, they are much more flexible than articulated manipulators to perform tasks in cluttered space. However, autonomous manipulation constrained by tasks other than grasping has not been studied for continuum manipulators. In this paper, we introduce a general and efficient approach for autonomous continuum manipulation under task constraints. We consider a spatial continuum manipulator with multiple uniform-curvature sections if not deformed. We further apply the approach to an example of inspection task in a cluttered environment to verify its effectiveness. The high-efficiency of our approach makes it suitable to run on-line for guiding task-constrained manipulation in real-time.",

However, the kinematic modeling of CTR is challenging because of complicated physical phenomena caused by the elasticity interaction between tubes. Existing control methods of CTR are based on inverse kinematics calculation and hence the control performance largely relies on the accuracy of kinematics model used. In this work, we propose a new control method from the actuator level and show that the control design of actuator input in task-space with approximate Jacobian matrix provides more flexibility and robustness in handling inaccuracy in kinematics model. It is shown through simulation study that the proposed control method presents better performance compared with traditional inverse kinematics based control method in face of kinematics inaccuracy.",

Motivated by recent neuroscientific studies on the human grasping behavior, a novel grasp strategy is built upon past analysis regarding the task-specificity of human grasps, that also complies with the recent soft synergy model of underactuated hands. Our scheme determines an efficient force closure grasp (i.e., configuration and contact points/forces) with a posture compatible with the desired task, taking into consideration the mechanical and geometric limitations imposed by the design of the hand and the object shape. The efficiency of the algorithm is verified through simulated paradigms on a hypothetical underactuated hand with the kinematic model of the DLR/HIT II five fingered robot hand.",

        "abstract": "For efficient and safe locomotion the gaits of legged robots should vary with the type of terrain. Hence, terrain surface classification is an important problem for this class of mobile robots. Prior research has developed approaches to proprioceptive terrain classification for both wheeled and limbed robots that use sensor measurements dependent upon the dynamics of the robot, which ultimately requires the classification system to be trained at a large number of operating conditions (e.g., vehicle speeds and loads). This research develops an approach to terrain identification based on pressure images generated through direct surface contact using a robot skin constructed around a high-resolution pressure sensing array. Terrain signatures for classification are formulated from the magnitude frequency responses of the pressure images. The methodology is used to train and test a classifier using dynamically measured pressure images from a one-legged hopping robot. Experimental tests yield high classification accuracies, which are independent with respect to changing robot dynamics (i.e., different leg gaits). The findings of this paper suggest the methodology can be extended to autonomous field robots, providing the robot with crucial information about the environment that can be used to aid stability over rough terrains and enhance motion planning over varying terrains.",

This work explores an alternative approach to GPS sensors to avoid typical drawbacks, such as inaccuracies of standalone sensors or weight/cost for Real Time Kinematic (RTK) setups. To this end, the paper studies a setup consisting of a tether linking the helicopter to the landing point. Appropriate sensing of tether attitude relative to the helicopter together with an altitude measurement, allows estimation of the helicopter's linear position relative to the landing point. Additionally, the tension exerted on the tether provides a stabilizing effect on helicopter translational dynamics. Taking into account all these considerations, a model-based control strategy is developed and implemented in the real platform. The experimental results endorse the validity of the proposed approach.",

Design goal is to operate the robot with high-performance feedback control at cycles beyond 1kHz but to retain the flexibility of prototyping control algorithms. This is achieved with the concept of a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) that provides a convenient high-level interface to the entire robotic hardware. The requirements for the design of a HAL in terms of functionality and implementation are presented that improve the integration of complex robot hardware with prototype control applications. Experiments with the HAL of the DLR Hand Arm System demonstrate the high performance of a Simulink Interface implementation.

        "abstract": "We introduce the Partial View Heat Kernel (PVHK) descriptor, for the purpose of 3D object representation and recognition from partial views, assumed to be partial object surfaces under self occlusion. PVHK describes partial views in a geometrically meaningful way, i.e., by establishing a unique relation between the shape of the view and the descriptor. PVHK is also stable with respect to sensor noise and therefore adequate for sensors, such as the current active 3D cameras. Furthermore, PVHK takes full advantage of the dual 3D/RGB nature of current sensors and seamlessly incorporates appearance information onto the 3D information. We formally define the PVHK descriptor, discuss related work, provide evidence of the PVHK properties and validate them in three purposefully diverse datasets, and demonstrate its potential for recognition tasks.",

        "abstract": "Analytical results describing the optimal trajectories for general classes of robot systems have proven elusive, in part because the optimal trajectories for a complex system may not exist, or may be computed only numerically from differential equations. This paper studies a simpler optimization problem: finding an optimal sequence and optimal durations of motion primitives (simple preprogrammed actions) to reach a goal. By adding a fixed cost for each switch between primitives, we ensure that optimal trajectories exist and are well-behaved. To demonstrate this approach, we prove some general results that geometrically characterize time-optimal trajectories for rigid bodies in the plane with costly switches (allowing comparison with previous analysis of optimal motion using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle), and also present a complete analytical solution for a problem of moving a heavy park bench by rotating the bench around each end point in sequence.",

        "abstract": "Chaos is an interesting phenomenon displayed by non-linear systems that has been used in robotics and found empirically on real robots' behaviour. This paper presents a formal proof that Braitenberg vehicle 2b, a bio-inspired control mechanism for unicycle robots, behaves as a mass in a potential well. This provides a powerful analogy to understand Braitenberg vehicle 2b as a mechanical system and it implies that its behaviour can be chaotic. Implementing a Braitenberg vehicle in robotics entails defining a stimulus function in the environment. Inspired by previous works and using the obtained theoretical results, this paper proposes the free area perceived by a robot as a stimulus to generate collision free continuous chaotic motion on a bounded space. In non-linear systems chaos appears when a parameter is changed in a family of dynamical systems. Similarly, our implementation on a real robot demonstrates that both, chaotic and non chaotic trajectories can be obtained depending on the stimulus function built. The behaviour is explained through the analogy with the mass in the potential well.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses the design of legged walking robots that are exactly constrained during the stance phase of locomotion. Legged robots with a large number of actuated degrees of freedom, while allowing for the widest range of controllable foot placements, often end up with overconstrained kinematics when in contact with the ground, requiring complex redundant control schemes for effective locomotion. Exactly-constrained robots would be capable of full body mobility while avoiding the weight and complexity costs of fully actuating each joint and would also allow for simpler control schemes. We discuss the constraints and degrees of freedom of a common legged robot kinematic structure and describe strategies for removing redundant constraints. Two major design considerations \u2014 architectural singularities and the uniqueness of the ground reaction forces \u2014 are discussed along with potential solutions. Finally, a prototype exactly-constrained walking robot is presented as a validation of this design strategy.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The quest for ever faster pick-and-place robots has led to ingenious parallel robots with reduced mobility, e.g., capable of producing motions proper of SCARA systems: three independent translations and one rotation about an axis of fixed direction. These robots are also known as Sch\u00f6nflies-motion generators (SMG). Some parallel versions are commercially available, as are serial-parallel designs. The former are provided with four limbs, the latter with three, the fourth degree of freedom being appended in series with a Delta robot. Parallel robots are more attractive than their hybrid counterparts, but the presence of four legs poses serious challenges to their designers, as limb-interference limits the rotatability of the moving plate. A solution to this problem includes a gear train for rotation-range amplification, but this increases the inertial load on the motors and complicates the design \u2014 too many parts \u2014 and the control \u2014 because of inherent gear backlash and Coulomb friction. Recently, a SMG system was proposed that is supplied with two limbs, arrayed in an isostatic structure, which provides high rotatability of its gripper. This robot is driven by one C (cylindrical)-joint at each limb. As this joint allows for two degrees of freedom, it calls for two motors, that might as well be fixed to the base, which poses interesting design challenges. Reported in this paper is a design solution for the drive of a C joint, which is termed the C (cylindrical)-drive, based on a cylindrical differential mechanism of the RHHR type, with R standing for revolute, H for helical (or screw) joint. The design, kinematics and dynamics of the drive are discussed, along with a realization, and preliminary tests.",

The swarm of robots is teleoperated by a human hand whose fingertip motions are tracked, e.g., using an RGB-D camera. We solve the kinematic dissimilarity of this unique master-slave system using a multi-layered approach that includes: a hand interpreter that translates the fingertip motion in a desired motion for the object to be manipulated; a mapping algorithm that transforms the desired object motions into a suitable set of virtual points deviating from the planned contact points; a compliant force control for the case of quadrotor UAVs that allows to use them as indirect 3D force effectors. Visual feedback is also used as sensory substitution technique to provide a hint on the internal forces exerted on the object. We validate the approach with several human-in-the-loop simulations including the full physical model of the object, contact points and UAVs.",

        "abstract": "The ability to move in complex environments is a fundamental requirement for robots to be a part of our daily lives. Increasing the controller complexity may be a desirable choice in order to obtain an improved performance. However, these two aspects may pose a considerable challenge on the optimization of robotic controllers. In this paper, we study the trade-offs between the complexity of reactive controllers and the complexity of the environment in the optimization of multi-robot obstacle avoidance for resource-constrained platforms. The optimization is carried out in simulation using a distributed, noise-resistant implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization, and the resulting controllers are evaluated both in simulation and with real robots. We show that in a simple environment, linear controllers with only two parameters perform similarly to more complex non-linear controllers with up to twenty parameters, even though the latter ones require more evaluation time to be learned. In a more complicated environment, we show that there is an increase in performance when the controllers can differentiate between front and backwards sensors, but increasing further the number of sensors and adding non-linear activation functions provide no further benefit. In both environments, augmenting reactive control laws with simple memory capabilities causes the highest increase in performance. We also show that in the complex environment the performance measurements are noisier, the optimal parameter region is smaller, and more iterations are required for the optimization process to converge.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a method for computing the global time optimal path of a mobile robot navigating among obstacles subject to safe braking constraints. The paper first generalizes the classical Brachistochrone problem into a time optimal navigation problem, where the mobile robot navigates under a braking safety constraint near a point obstacle or a wall segment. The time optimal navigation problem is then formulated for general polygonal environments. Based on this formulation, the paper constructs a speed graph for the environment which consists of time optimal arcs that connect critical via points. The speed graph is then used to identify the path homotopy class which most likely contains the global time optimal path. Once a candidate homotopy class is selected, the exact time optimal path subject to safe braking constraints is computed within the homotopy class based on convexity properties of these paths. The results are illustrated with examples, described as readily implementable procedures, and demonstrated with experiments.",

Nevertheless, simultaneous collection of information about the position of contacts and about the magnitude and direction of forces is still an elusive task. In this paper we introduce a wearable device that addresses this problem, and can be used to measure generalized forces during grasping. By assembling two supports around a commercial 6-axis force/torque sensor we obtain a thimble that can be easily positioned on a fingertip. The device is used in conjunction with an active marker-based motion capture system to simultaneously obtain absolute position and orientation of the thimbles, without requiring any assumptions on the kinematics of the hand. Finally, using the contact centroid algorithm, introduced in [1], position of contact points during grasping are determined. This paper shows the design and implementation of the device, as well as some preliminary experimental validation.",

The planner defines the trajectory for a virtual vehicle that will be used as reference for the real Follower vehicle. The virtual Follower behaves like a three dimensional trailer attached to the Leader and its reference frame is used to specify the relative position vector. At the kinematic level, the proposed planner requires only the knowledge of the Leader's linear speed, but not its angular speed, and the Follower's trajectory can be generated on-line, in the sense that no a priori knowledge of the Leader's trajectory is required. Experimental results obtained with quadrotor vehicles are presented, which demonstrate the richness of the planned trajectories.",

        "abstract": "One major challenge for untethered micro-scale mobile robotics is the manipulation of external objects in the robot's three-dimensional (3D) work environment. Here, we present a method to use the capillary force at a solid-liquid-gas interface to reversibly attach objects to a mobile magnetic microrobot. This is accomplished by the addition of a cavity in the hydrophobic microrobot, in which an air bubble is captured when the microrobot is placed in a water environment. The extension of the air bubble from the cavity is adjusted dynamically by controlling the pressure of the workspace environment. A peak switching ratio between the maximum and minimum gripping forces of 14:1 is shown for controlled attachment/detachment experiments, which allows for reliable pick-and-place operation. This work introduces an analytical capillary adhesion model and demonstrates control of the bubble size for pick-and-place gripping. A proof-of-concept demonstration of 3D manipulation in a fluidic environment shows the potential of capillary gripping for future use in confined environments such as inside microfluidic devices for transportation or assembly of hydrophobic objects.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this endeavor, a hybrid control strategy has been proposed for composite path tracking control of a nonholonomic wheeled mobile robotic (WMR) system under parametric and nonparametric uncertainties. A WMR, often in practical circumstances, undergoes through various parametric changes. Moreover, modeling of WMR in presence of friction, slip or skid, backlash etc. is very difficult. These factors, which make the system model more cumbersome, are normally ignored but their effects are compensated through appropriate control methods. Conventional Sliding Mode Control (SMC) is such a method but it is susceptible to chattering due to high switching gains and reasonable tracking accuracy is sacrificed to avoid chattering. On the other hand, Time Delay Control (TDC) technique is highly efficient to assure robustness against unknown dynamics but it is unable to eliminate approximation errors that arise due to introduced delay. Considering the aforesaid difficulties of SM and TD controllers a hybrid control methodology christened as Time Delay Sliding Mode Control (SMC-TD) is adopted in this work for accurate path tracking of nonholonomic WMR. The SMC-TD is absolutely a judicious blending of SMC and TDC strategies aiming at elimination of the individual shortcomings while retaining the positive advantages. Detail features and advantages of the proposed controller are presented in greater length along with the experimental results, which are very promising.",

        "abstract": "Mobile robots with independently steerable wheels provide better robustness and efficiency compared to the other types of omnidirectional mobile robots. However, the non-holonomic constraints and singular configurations give rise to several challenging issues in exploiting the high maneuverability features of the robot. Many proposed motion controllers for such robots force the robot to stay outside of bulky regions around its singular points, which in turn limits the robot's dexterity. In this paper, which extends our previous works, we present an online trajectory generation along with a globally stable path following controller that enables the robot to follow any given smooth path and heading function. We show that the control signals extensively simplify the kinematic constraints and are utilized to develop an efficient online \u201cPhase Plane\u201d switching algorithm that bounds the velocities and accelerations of the actuators. Moreover, we show that the algorithm efficiently regulates the velocity of the robot around the singular configurations which allows the robot to realize wide ranges of complex maneuvers. The proposed control algorithm has been tested on iMoro(our four-wheeled independently steerable mobile manipulator), and the presented results show the efficacy of our method.",

The method enables trajectory planning based on the dynamics of the system with time constraint. Moreover, this method allows rendezvous planning of two dynamic systems where only one is controlled. To reach this objective, we introduce a new concept termed Time-Based RRT (TB-RRT) which is an extended version of the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT). The concept of the TB-RRT is to add time parameters to the nodes in the tree such that each node denotes a specific state in a specific time. The algorithm was implemented in two applications to demonstrate the approach and validate its feasibility; The first application is a one degree of freedom bat hitting a ball and the second application is a three degrees of freedom manipulator catching a moving object. Simulation results show the system accurately following the planned trajectory and the robot catching the object in time.",

        "abstract": "Telerobotics has the potential to facilitate the repair of satellites in geosynchronous orbit by allowing human operators to interact naturally with remote objects. Time delays on the order of seconds make it difficult to provide immersive feedback to the operator, motivating the use of predictive visual and haptic displays of the robot and environment. A teleoperation framework developed for this scenario invokes a two-part environment model that predicts motion of objects in the environment, both in free space and during contact with the robot. When objects in the environment are in free space, a propagated model using delayed data provides predictive feedback to the operator. However, when the robot interacts with the environment, a local environment model that does not propagate delayed data is used. This reduces computational load and ensures stability during robot-environment interactions. Two experiments were carried out to test the teleoperation system. Results demonstrate the ability of the prediction algorithm to provide reliable feedback and improve operator performance before, during, and after robot-environment interactions.",

A novel motion planning method for Sambot configuration using model checking is presented in this paper. This hierarchical method contains two layers. The abstract logic layer is responsible for the discrete planning of Sambots configuration. The robot and the environment are all modeled as timed automata. System requirements are formalized as Computational Tree Logic (CTL) formulas. Model checking is applied on the system model. The verification result gives the optimal discrete plans for the configuration of Sambot. In physical layer, a sample-based planner generates the trajectory trace considering the dynamics of Sambot and the suggested high level plans. The experiment results illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

Specifically, we can prevent the robot from tipping over, rolling over, and tumbling over. The tipover stability criteria for a tracked mobile manipulator are discussed and the velocity kinematic model of the manipulator for SCG adjustment is also presented in this paper. The embedded 3-axial gyroscope provides us the data necessary for the SCG computation. The algorithm outputs the adjustments needed on the joint angles in order to maintain the SCG within a body-fixed safety zone.

The redundant factor of RAREKF is designed as a function of the load to provide desirable tolerant capability to the modeling error and load-dependent filtering mode switching.

        "abstract": "The concentric-tube continuum robot generates distal end motions by translating and rotating the proximal ends of pre-curved tubes that overlap concentrically. This robot does not require additional actuators along the tubes because the overall curvature and distal end position are determined solely by interactions between the inner and outer tubes. However, under certain conditions, the rotation of the distal end is hindered as the actuation energy accumulates into torsional energy of the tubes. As the distal ends are rotated further, the accumulated energy from the twisting is suddenly released, which makes the tubes snap to a remote position. This is called the snapping problem, and it considerably limits the performance of the robot. In this paper, we propose a novel design for the concentric tubes to eliminate the snapping problem. The new design creates groove patterns on superelastic nitinol tubes to make the tubes more flexible to bending than twisting. Simulations and experiments were performed to verify that the tubes with our groove patterns had anisotropic structural characteristics, and video image analysis verified that this structural property can eliminate the snapping problem. A concentric-tube robot with this new tube design can have a larger workspace area because tubes with greater curvatures can be used without the snapping problem.",

Although MVs are very noisy and with low spatial resolution, MVs do possess high temporal resolution which means it is possible to merge MVs from different frames to improve signal quality. Homography filtering and MV thresholding are proposed to further improve MV quality so that we can establish plane observations from MVs. We propose an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based approach to simultaneously track robot motion and planes. We formally model error propagation of MVs and derive variance of the merged MVs. We have implemented the proposed method and tested it in physical experiments. Results show that the system is capable of performing robot localization and plane mapping with a relative trajectory error of less than 5.1%.",

        "abstract": "Vitreoretinal microsurgery requires precise hand-eye coordination to manipulate delicate structures within the eye on the order of tens of microns. To achieve these tasks, surgeons use tools of diameter 0.9 mm or less to access the eye's interior structures. The level of force required during these manipulations is often below the human tactile threshold, requiring the surgeon to rely on subtle visual cues or to apply larger forces above the tactile threshold for feedback. However, both of these methods can lead to tissue damage. Excursions can be made into tissues which are not felt by the surgeon, while larger forces have a higher chance of damaging tissue within the eye. To prevent damage to the retina and other anatomy, we present the implementation of hybrid position/force control operating in the sub-tactile force range for a handheld robotic system. This approach resulted in a 42% reduction in the mean force and 52% reduction in maximum force during peeling tasks.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the dynamics, control, planning, and visual servoing for micro aerial vehicles to perform high-speed aerial grasping tasks. We draw inspiration from agile, fast-moving birds, such as raptors, that detect, locate, and execute high-speed swoop maneuvers to capture prey. Since these grasping maneuvers are predominantly in the sagittal plane, we consider the planar system and present mathematical models and algorithms for motion planning and control, required to incorporate similar capabilities in quadrotors equipped with a monocular camera. In particular, we develop a dynamical model directly in the image space, show that this is a differentially-flat system with the image features serving as flat outputs, outline a method for generating trajectories directly in the image feature space, develop a geometric visual controller that considers the second order dynamics (in contrast to most visual servoing controllers that assume first order dynamics), and present validation of our methods through both simulations and experiments.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports on a method for an autonomous underwater vehicle to perform real-time visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) on large ship hulls over multiple sessions. Along with a monocular camera, our method uses a piecewise-planar model to explicitly optimize the ship hull surface in our factor-graph framework, and anchor nodes to co-register multiple surveys. To enable realtime performance for long-term SLAM, we use the recent Generic Linear Constraints (GLC) framework to sparsify our factor-graph. This paper analyzes how our single-session SLAM techniques can be used in the GLC framework, and describes a particle filter reacquisition algorithm so that an underwater session can be automatically re-localized to a previously built SLAM graph. We provide real-world experimental results involving automated ship hull inspection, and show that our localization filter out-performs Fast Appearance-Based Mapping (FAB-MAP), a popular place-recognition system. Using our approach, we can automatically align surveys that were taken days, months, and even years apart.",

The proposed method provides a principled framework for fusing the complementary information obtained from 3D lidar and camera imagery for recognizing places within an a priori map of a dynamic environment. The visual appearance of the locations in the map can be significantly different due to changing weather, lighting conditions and dynamical objects present in the environment. Various 3D/2D features are extracted from the textured point clouds (scans) and each scan is represented as a collection of these features. For two scans acquired from the same location, the high value of MI between the features present in the scans indicates that the scans are captured from the same location. We use a non-parametric entropy estimator to estimate the true MI from the sparse marginal and joint histograms of the features extracted from the scans. Experimental results using seasonal datasets collected over several years are used to validate the robustness of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate continuum manipulators that are analogous to conventional rigid-link parallel robot designs. These \u201cparallel continuum manipulators\u201d have the potential to inherit some of the compactness and compliance of continuum robots while retaining some of the precision, stability, and strength of rigid-link parallel robots, yet they represent a relatively unexplored area of the broad manipulator design space. We describe the construction of a prototype manipulator structure with six compliant legs connected in a parallel pattern similar to that of a Stewart-Gough platform. We formulate the static forward and inverse kinematics problems for such manipulators as the solution to multiple Cosserat-rod models with coupled boundary conditions, and we test the accuracy of this approach in a set of experiments, including the prediction of leg buckling. An inverse kinematics simulation of slices through the 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) workspace illustrates the kinematic mapping, range of motion, and force required for actuation, which sheds light on the potential advantages and tradeoffs that parallel continuum manipulators may bring. Potential applications include miniature wrists and arms for endoscopic medical procedures, and lightweight compliant arms for safe interaction with humans.",

Compared to simpler grippers and underactuated hands, they should be more capable of grasping and, especially, manipulating different objects. This paper explores the relationship between kinematic design and manipulation performance of robotic hands. Some evaluation criteria frequently used by hand designers to verify kinematic configurations are revisited. The results from these criteria are scrutinized and compared with the evaluation of the manipulation workspace and the ranges of motion of inhand manipulation for a set of predefined objects. Simulations and actual manipulation experiments are carried out with different kinematic configurations on a modular dexterous hand. The results show some disconnection between perceived good designs through common evaluation criteria and their actual, realizable manipulation performance. This work finally gives some insight toward a more holistic approach to design hands that better address grasp and manipulation for the intended tasks and applications.",

This paper improves on the existing state of the art as it describes BTs in a more accurate and compact way, while providing insight about their actual representation capabilities.

Vascular network, tumors and cut planes, computed from pre-operative data, can be overlaid onto the laparoscopic view for image-guidance, even in the case of large motion or deformation of the organ. Compared to current methods, our method is able to precisely propagate surface motion to the internal structures. This is made possible by relying on a fast yet accurate biomechanical model of the liver combined with a robust visual tracking approach designed to properly constrain the model. Augmentation results are demonstrated on in-vivo sequences of a human liver during robotic surgery, while quantitative validation is performed on an ex-vivo porcine liver experimentation. Validation results show that our approach gives an accurate surface registration with an error of less than 6mm on the position of the tumor.",

        "abstract": "Developing control methods that allow legged robots to move with skill and agility remains one of the grand challenges in robotics. In order to achieve this ambitious goal, legged robots must possess a wide repertoire of motor skills. A scalable control architecture that can represent a variety of gaits in a unified manner is therefore desirable. Inspired by the motor learning principles observed in nature, we use an optimization approach to automatically discover and fine-tune parameters for agile gaits. The success of our approach is due to the controller parameterization we employ, which is compact yet flexible, therefore lending itself well to learning through repetition. We use our method to implement a flying trot, a bound and a pronking gait for StarlETH, a fully autonomous quadrupedal robot.",

        "abstract": "Visual-inertial navigation systems (VINS) have prevailed in various applications, in part because of the complementary sensing capabilities and decreasing costs as well as sizes. While many of the current VINS algorithms undergo inconsistent estimation, in this paper we introduce a new extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based approach towards consistent estimates. To this end, we impose both state-transition and obervability constraints in computing EKF Jacobians so that the resulting linearized system can best approximate the underlying nonlinear system. Specifically, we enforce the propagation Jacobian to obey the semigroup property, thus being an appropriate state-transition matrix. This is achieved by parametrizing the orientation error state in the global, instead of local, frame of reference, and then evaluating the Jacobian at the propagated, instead of the updated, state estimates. Moreover, the EKF linearized system ensures correct observability by projecting the most-accurate measurement Jacobian onto the observable subspace so that no spurious information is gained. The proposed algorithm is validated by both Monte-Carlo simulation and real-world experimental tests.",

        "abstract": "There exists an increasing demand to incorporate mobile interactive robots to assist humans in repetitive, non-value added tasks in the manufacturing domain. Our aim is to develop a mobile robotic assistant for fetch-and-deliver tasks in human-oriented assembly line environments. Assembly lines present a niche yet novel challenge for mobile robots; the robot must precisely control its position on a surface which may be either stationary, moving, or split (e.g. in the case that the robot straddles the moving assembly line and remains partially on the stationary surface). In this paper we present a control and sensing solution for a mobile robotic assistant as it traverses a moving-floor assembly line. Solutions readily exist for control of wheeled mobile robots on static surfaces; we build on the open-source Robot Operating System (ROS) software architecture and generalize the algorithms for the moving line environment. Off-the-shelf sensors and localization algorithms are explored to sense the moving surface, and a customized solution is presented using PX4Flow optic flow sensors and a laser scanner-based localization algorithm. Validation of the control and sensing system is carried out both in simulation and in hardware experiments on a customized treadmill. Initial demonstrations of the hardware system yield promising results; the robot successfully maintains its position while on, and while straddling, the moving line.",

However, whole-image-based localization systems typically rely on heuristic methods for determining appropriate matching thresholds in a particular environment. These environment-specific tuning requirements and the lack of a meaningful interpretation of arbitrary thresholds limit the general applicability of these systems. In this paper we present a Bayesian model of probability for whole-image descriptors that can be seamlessly integrated into localization systems designed for probabilistic visual input. We demonstrate this method using CAT-Graph, an appearance-based visual localization system originally designed for a FAB-MAP-style probabilistic input. We show that using whole-image descriptors as visual input extends CAT-Graph's functionality to environments that experience a greater amount of perceptual change. We also present a method of estimating whole-image probability models in an online manner, removing the need for a prior training phase. We show that this online, automated training method can perform comparably to pre-trained, manually tuned local descriptor methods.",

Experimental comparison to a leading EKF-based filtering approach on both synthetic signals and a ball-tracking dataset shows that the Quaternion Bingham Filter (QBF) has lower tracking error than the EKF, particularly when the state is highly dynamic.

The resulting techniques allow for trajectories specified by a user to be modified for reduced risk of collision and increased reliability. We test our approach in the underwater ocean monitoring domain, and we show that the proposed framework reduces the risk of collision with ship traffic by as much as 51% for an autonomous underwater vehicle operating in ocean currents.

However, previous methods are applicable only when the demonstrations and trajectory generation are performed under the same initial conditions. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that learns through demonstrations and generates a trajectory regardless of the initial conditions. The variance of the demonstrated trajectories over the initial conditions is modeled and learned using a statistical method, and the learned trajectories are generalized and used to generate a trajectory. As an example, the bi-manual looping task of a surgical thread was demonstrated by changing the initial positions of the robot arms, and a trajectory was then planned given these initial arbitrary positions. The proposed algorithm was verified through simulations and experiments using an actual robotic surgical system.",

        "abstract": "Visual localization in outdoor environments is often hampered by the natural variation in appearance caused by such things as weather phenomena, diurnal fluctuations in lighting, and seasonal changes. Such changes are global across an environment and, in the case of global light changes and seasonal variation, the change in appearance occurs in a regular, cyclic manner. Visual localization could be greatly improved if it were possible to predict the appearance of a particular location at a particular time, based on the appearance of the location in the past and knowledge of the nature of appearance change over time. In this paper, we investigate whether global appearance changes in an environment can be learned sufficiently to improve visual localization performance. We use time of day as a test case, and generate transformations between morning and afternoon using sample images from a training set. We demonstrate the learned transformation can be generalized from training data and show the resulting visual localization on a test set is improved relative to raw image comparison. The improvement in localization remains when the area is revisited several weeks later.",

This project aims to share various algorithms and evaluate their performance in public. At first, landmark-based localization is briefly reviewed with respect to its types of input measurements. From its generalized problem formulation, we adopt a common interface for algorithms in the toolbox. Each algorithm is based on diverse types of input measurements (e.g. distance or bearing angle) in different dimension of space (e.g. 2D or 3D). To support capricious requirements, the toolbox follows the most general convention on measurements and space. In our performance evaluation, nine algorithms were experimentally compared in the view of position and orientation accuracy. The evaluation also leads helpful comments on landmark-based localization and its applications. Since Triangulation Toolbox is designed to be simple and flexible, many developers and researchers can refer implemented algorithms for their applications and also evaluate their own algorithm through the benchmark.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses a new control strategy to reduce the damage to a humanoid robot during a fall. Instead of following the traditional approach of finding a favorable configuration with which to fall to the ground, this method attempts to stop the robot from falling all the way to the ground. This prevents the full transfer of the robot's potential energy to kinetic energy, and consequently results in a milder impact. The controlled motion of the falling robot involves a sequence of three deliberate contacts to the ground with the swing foot and two hands, in that order. In the final configuration the robot's center of mass (CoM) remains relatively high from the floor and the robot has a relatively stable three-point contact with the ground; hence the name tripod fall. The optimal location of the three contacts are learned through reinforcement learning algorithm. The controller is simulated on a full size humanoid, and experimentally tested on the NAO humanoid robot. In this work we apply our fall controller only to a forward fall.",

        "abstract": "On typical multi-robot teams, there is an implicit assumption that robots can be trusted to effectively perform assigned tasks. The multi-robot patrolling task is an example of a domain that is particularly sensitive to reliability and performance of robots. Yet reliable performance of team members may not always be a valid assumption even within homogeneous teams. For instance, a robot's performance may deteriorate over time or a robot may not estimate tasks correctly. Robots that can identify poorly performing team members as performance deteriorates, can dynamically adjust the task assignment strategy. This paper investigates the use of an observation based trust model for detecting unreliable robot team members. Robots can reason over this model to perform dynamic task reassignment to trusted team members. Experiments were performed in simulation and using a team of indoor robots in a patrolling task to demonstrate both centralized and decentralized approaches to task reassignment. The results clearly demonstrate that the use of a trust model can improve performance in the multi-robot patrolling task.",

Wheeled morphology is extremely good on the flat terrain, and the legged morphology has great mobility on the rough terrain, as proved by the legged animals. Thus, as the terrain nowadays is highly mixed with natural rough terrain, artificial rough terrain (ex: stair, bumps, etc), and artificial flat terrain (ex: road), designing a good robotic platform which can operated on all three categories may be a good solution. In the last few decades researchers have come up with two different approaches to elevate robots' adaption to the environment: one is to design special mechanisms to overcome uneven terrain, and the other is to focus on behavioral development of a given robot to adapt different situations. Both approaches exist, but only a few works tried to solve the problem from both aspects simultaneously.",

We present a theoretical design that allows to exert an arbitrary 3D force by using a standard near-hovering controller that was originally developed for contact-free flight control. This is achieved by analytically solving the nonlinear system that relates the quadrotor state, the force exerted by the rigid tool on the environment, and the near-hovering controller action at the equilibrium points, during any generic contact. Stability of the equilibria for the most relevant actions (pushing, releasing, lifting, dropping, and left-right shifting) are proven by means of numerical analysis using the indirect Lyapunov method. An experimental platform, including a suitable tool design, has been developed and used to validate the theory with preliminary experiments.",

This paper describes an algorithm to find caging formations of a 3D polyhedron for two point fingers using a lower-dimensional contact-space formulation. The paper shows that contact space has several useful properties. First, the critical points of the cage in the hand's configuration space are identical to the critical points of the interfinger distance in contact space. Second, contact space can be naturally decomposed into 4D regions having useful properties. A geometric analysis of the critical points of the interfinger distance function results in a catalog of grasps in which the cages change topology, leading to a simple test to classify critical points. These properties lead to an easily constructed caging graph whose nodes contain the critical points of contact space. Starting from an immobilizing grasp, this graph can be searched to find local, intermediate, and maximal caging regions around that initial grasp. An implemented algorithm demonstrates the method.",

        "abstract": "Maintaining clearance, or distance from obstacles, is a vital component of successful motion planning algorithms. Maintaining high clearance often creates safer paths for robots. Contemporary sampling-based planning algorithms that utilize the medial axis, or the set of all points equidistant to two or more obstacles, produce higher clearance paths. However, they are biased heavily toward certain portions of the medial axis, sometimes ignoring parts critical to planning, e.g., specific types of narrow passages. We introduce Uniform Medial Axis Probabilistic RoadMap (UMAPRM), a novel planning variant that generates samples uniformly on the medial axis of the free portion of Cspace. We theoretically analyze the distribution generated by UMAPRM and show its uniformity. Our results show that UMAPRM's distribution of samples along the medial axis is not only uniform but also preferable to other medial axis samplers in certain planning problems. We demonstrate that UMAPRM has negligible computational overhead over other sampling techniques and can solve problems the others could not, e.g., a bug trap. Finally, we demonstrate UMAPRM successfully generates higher clearance paths in the examples.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we consider the situation in which a robot is deployed in an unknown scenario and has to explore the entire environment without possibility of measuring its absolute position. The robot can take relative position measurements (from odometry and from place revisiting episodes) and can then estimate autonomously its trajectory. Therefore, the quality of the resulting estimate depends on the motion strategy adopted by the robot. The problem of uncertainty-constrained exploration is then to explore the environment while satisfying given bounds on the admissible uncertainty in the estimation process. We adopt a moving horizon strategy in which the robot plans its motion T steps ahead. Our formulation leads to a mixed-integer linear problem that has several desirable properties: (i) it guarantees that the robot motion is collision free, (ii) it guarantees that the uncertainty constraints are met, (iii) it enables the design of algorithms that efficiently solve moderately sized instances of the exploration problem. We elucidate on the proposed formulation with numerical experiments.",

In this study, an extended PI model is generalized by introducing a creep model to the basic hysteretic operator of the PI model at the inflexion point of the hysteresis loop. Unified compensation for hysteresis and creep can be implemented with the extended PI model. Experiment results demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the extended PI model and it is implied that the inflexion creep compensation not only improves the tip positioning precision at the inflexion points on the hysteresis loops, but also the localization effectiveness during the whole process of PZT actuation.",

These different dynamic systems have state spaces with different dimensions, and hence instead of using full state feedback, the universal controller is derived as a single output feedback controller that stabilizes them. This paper analyzes the robustness of the derived universal controller to disturbances and parameter uncertainties, and demonstrates its universality and superiority to similarly derived LQR and H\u221e controllers. This paper also presents nonlinear simulation results of the universal controller successfully stabilizing a family of bongoboard, curved floor, seesaw, tilting and rocking floor models.",

        "abstract": "Object detection and recognition are fundamental capabilities for a mobile robot. Objects are a powerful representation for a variety of tasks including mobile manipulation and inventory tracking. As a result, object-based world representations have seen a great deal of research interest in the last several years. However, these systems usually assume that object recognition is well-solved: they require that accurate recognition be available for every object they might encounter. Despite steady advances, object recognition remains a difficult, open problem. Existing object recognition algorithms rely on high-resolution three-dimensional object models or on extensive hand-labeled training data. The sheer variety of objects that occur in natural environments makes manually training a recognizer for every possible object infeasible. In this work, we present a robotic system for unsupervised object and class discovery, in which objects are first discovered, and then grouped into classes in an unsupervised fashion. At each step, we approach the problem as one of robotics, not disembodied computer vision. On a very large robotic dataset, we discover object classes with 98.7% precision while achieving 71.8% recall. The scale and quality of these results demonstrate the merit of our approach, and prove the practicality of long-term large-scale object discovery. To our knowledge, no other authors have investigated robotic object discovery at this scale, making direct quantitative comparison impossible. We make our implementation and ground-truth labelings available, and evaluate our technique on a very large dataset. As a result, this work is a baseline against which future work can be compared.",

HMP3D classifiers are trained using a synthetic dataset of virtual scenes generated using CAD models from an online database. Our scene labeling system combines features learned from raw RGB-D images and 3D point clouds directly, without any hand-designed features, to assign an object label to every 3D point in the scene. Experiments on the RGB-D Scenes Dataset v.2 demonstrate that the proposed approach can be used to label indoor scenes containing both small tabletop objects and large furniture pieces.",

It is clear that, in order to obtain a reliable and accurate representation, not only the intrinsic parameters of each sensors should be precisely calibrated, but also the extrinsic parameters relating the two sensors should be precisely known. In this paper, we propose a human-friendly and reliable calibration framework, that enables to easily estimate both the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of a camera-depth sensor couple.

        "abstract": "A potential loop-closure image pair passes the geometric verification test if the number of inliers from the computation of the geometric constraint with RANSAC exceed a pre-defined threshold. The choice of the threshold is critical to the success of identifying the correct loop-closure image pairs. However, the value for this threshold often varies for different datasets and is chosen empirically. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method that learns the threshold for geometric verification directly from the observed inlier counts of all the potential loop-closure image pairs. We model the distributions of the inlier counts from all the potential loop-closure image pairs with a two components Log-Normal mixture model - one component represents the state of non loop-closure and the other represents the state of loop-closure, and learn the parameters with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. The intersection of the Log-Normal mixture distributions is the optimal threshold for geometric verification, i.e. the threshold that gives the minimum false positive and negative loop-closures. Our algorithm degenerates when there are too few or no loop-closures and we propose the \u03c72 test to detect this degeneracy. We verify our proposed method with several large-scale datasets collected from both the multi-camera setup and stereo camera.",

        "abstract": "Finding objects in human environments requires autonomous mobile robots to reason about potential object locations and to plan to perceive them accordingly. By using information about the 3D structure of the environment, knowledge about landmark objects and their spatial relationship to the sought object, search can be improved by directing the robot towards the most likely object locations. In this paper we have designed, implemented and evaluated an approach for searching for objects on the basis of Qualitative Spatial Relations (QSRs) such as left-of and in-front-of. On the basis of QSRs between landmarks and the sought object we generate metric poses of potential object locations using an extended version of the ternary point calculus and employ this information for view planning. Preliminary results show that search methods based on QSRs are faster and more reliable than methods not considering them.",

        "abstract": "One of the key elements for building a long-term robotic companion is incorporating the ability for a robot to continuously learn and engage in new tasks. Utilizing a defined workspace that provides various shared content between human and robot could assist in this learning process. Here, we propose integrating a touchscreen tablet and a robot learner for engaging the user during human-robot interaction scenarios. The robot learner's domain-independent core reasoner follows the structure of instance-based learning which addresses the issues of acquiring knowledge, encoding cases, and learning a retrieval metric. The system utilizes demonstrations provided by the user to auto-populate the knowledge base through natural interaction methods, encodes cases based on the feature structure provided by the user, and uses an adaptive-weighting technique to design a retrieval metric with linear regression in the feature-distance space. Through a tablet environment, the user teaches a task to the robot in a shared workspace and intuitively monitors the robot's behavior and progress in real time. In this setting, the user is able to interrupt the robot and provide necessary demonstrations at the moment learning is taking place, thus providing a means to continuously engage both the participant and the robot in the learning cycle.",

Our approach to generate scene graphs is probabilistic: Uncertainty in the object poses is addressed by a probabilistic sensor model that is embedded in a data driven MCMC process. We apply Markov logic inference to reason about hidden objects and to detect false estimates of object poses. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated and evaluated in real world experiments.",

        "abstract": "Monocular SLAM and Structure from Motion have been traditionally based on finding point correspondences in highly-textured image areas. Large textureless regions, usually found in indoor and urban environments, are difficult to reconstruct by these systems. In this paper we augment for the first time the traditional point-based monocular SLAM maps with superpixels. Superpixels are middle-level features consisting of image regions of homogeneous texture. We propose a novel scheme for superpixel matching, 3D initialization and optimization that overcomes the difficulties of salient point-based approaches in these areas of homogeneous texture. Our experimental results show the validity of our approach. First, we compare our proposal with a state-of-the-art multiview stereo system; being able to reconstruct the textureless regions that the latest cannot. Secondly, we present experimental results of our algorithm integrated with the point-based PTAM [1]; estimating, now in real-time, the superpixel textureless areas. Finally, we show the accuracy of the presented algorithm with a quantitative analysis of the estimation error.",

        "abstract": "Locomotion is one of the human's most important functions that serve survival, progress and interaction. Gait requires kinematic and dynamic coordination of the limbs and muscles, multi-sensory fusion and robust control mechanisms. The force stimulus generated by the interaction of the foot with the walking surface is a vital part of the human gait. Although there have been many studies trying to decipher the load feedback mechanisms of gait, there is a need for the development of a versatile system that can advance research and provide new functionality. In this paper, we present the design and characterization of a novel system, called Variable Stiffness Treadmill (VST). The device is capable of controlling load feedback stimulus by regulating the walking surface stiffness in real time. The high range of available stiffness, the resolution and accuracy of the device, as well as the ability to regulate stiffness within the stance phase of walking, are some of the unique characteristics of the VST. We present experiments with healthy subjects in order to prove the concept of our device and preliminary findings on the effect of altered stiffness on gait kinematics. The developed system constitutes a uniquely useful research tool, which can improve our understanding of gait and create new avenues of research on gait analysis and rehabilitation.",

Existing planning and control algorithms often give a 2D or 3D velocity vector field to be followed by a robot. However, quadrotors have complex nonlinear dynamics that make vector field following difficult, especially in aggressive maneuvering regimes. This paper exploits the differential flatness property of a quadrotor's dynamics to control its position along a given vector field. Differential flatness allows for the analytical derivation of control inputs in order to control the 12D dynamical state of the quadrotor such that the 2D or 3D position of the quadrotor follows the flow specified by a given vector field. The method is derived mathematically, and demonstrated in numerical simulations and in experiments with a quadrotor robot for three different vector fields.",

Predicated upon the understanding that collision detection will be improved by removing the effects of torque sensor error and friction compensation error, we propose an approach to measure these undesired effects in external torque residual signals without resorting to remodeling of the robot. Compensation of these effects leads to the proposed velocity-based variable thresholds which are shown to detect collisions with better efficacy than uncompensated methods. Implementation of the proposed velocity-based variable thresholds on a torque sensor equipped robot validates our methodology.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel walking method for torque controlled robots. The method is able to produce a wide range of speeds without requiring off-line optimizations and re-tuning of parameters. We use a quadratic whole-body optimization method running online which generates joint torques, given desired Cartesian accelerations of center of mass and feet. Using a dynamics model of the robot inside this optimizer, we ensure both compliance and tracking, required for fast locomotion. We have designed a foot-step planner that uses a linear inverted pendulum as simplified robot internal model. This planner is formulated as a quadratic convex problem which optimizes future steps of the robot. Fast libraries help us performing these calculations online. With very few parameters to tune and no perception, our method shows notable robustness against strong external pushes, relatively large terrain variations, internal noises, model errors and also delayed communication.",

The input is a single object or an animation created by an artist. In a first step, goal positions for the given number of vehicles and representing the object are optimized with respect to a known viewpoint. For displaying an animation, an optimal trajectory satisfying the dynamic constraints of each vehicle is computed using B-splines. Finally, a trajectory following controller is described, which provides the preferred velocity, later optimized to be collision-free with respect to all neighboring vehicles.",

We correlate this index with human navigational comfort (discomfort) and we discuss the importance of modeling visibility to improve human riding comfort. The proposed approach models the 3D visual field of view combined with a two-layered environmental representation. The field of view is modeled with information from the pose of the robot, a 3D laser sensor and a two-layered environmental representation composed of a 3D geometric map with traversale area information. Human navigational discomfort was extracted from participants riding the autonomous wheelchair. Results show that there is fair correlation between poor visibility locations (e.g., blind corners) and human discomfort. The approach can model places with identical traversable characteristics but different visibility and it differentiates visibility characteristics according to traveling direction.",

Existing methods require sufficient visual difference between the crop and soil for segmentation, or explicit knowledge of the structure of the crop rows. This method works by extracting and tracking the direction and lateral offset of the dominant parallel texture in a simulated overhead view of the scene and hence abstracts away crop-specific details such as colour, spacing and periodicity. The results demonstrate that the method is able to track crop rows across fields with extremely varied appearance during day and night. We demonstrate this method can autonomously guide a robot along the crop rows.",

Especially, unlike common approaches used with optical microscopy where orthographic projection model are used, we consider in this paper the weak-perspective model. The proposed vision-based force characterization allows to retrieve the three dimensional (3D) translational velocities and accelerations of a microrobot viewed from a digital microscope. Hence, thanks to the dynamic model the external forces are estimated on-line. The framework was applied and validated for a magnetic microrobot navigating in a viscous flow. Experimental results in two different environments illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, continuum robots have gained significant momentum in terms of technological maturity and clinical application. Their flexibility allows complex treatment sites to be reached with minimal trauma to the patient. However the reliable control of continuum robots is still an ongoing research issue in the robotics community because their deformable structure makes the modeling of these devices difficult. This motivates the use of external sensors or vision to achieve accurate control. In this paper, a motion control framework based on a vision sensor is proposed in order to perform accurate and controlled movements of a flexible robot that is mounted to an anthropomorphic robotic arm. The vision sensor, which relies on a single camera, provides accurate 3D shape reconstruction and spatial localisation of the flexible robot. This information is used to provide feedback for the real-time control of the flexible robot. The vision sensor detects the robot first in an image stream by modeling its appearance using compressed visual features in an online learning framework. This is combined with the kinematics information from the anthropomorphic robotic arm in order to accurately reconstruct and localise the 3D shape of the flexible robot by minimizing an energy function. Detailed analysis of the framework and a validation are presented in order to demonstrate the practical value of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "We present a visual based approach for reactive autonomous navigation of an underwater vehicle. In particular, we are interested in the exploration and continuous monitoring of coral reefs in order to diagnose disease or physical damage. An autonomous underwater vehicle needs to decide in real time the best route while avoiding collisions with fragile marine life and structure. We have opted to use only visual information as input. We have improved the Simple Linear Iterative Cluster algorithm which, together with a simple nearest neighbor classifier, robustly segment and classify objects from water in a fast and efficient way, even in poor visibility conditions. From the resulting classification and the current robot's direction and orientation, the next possible free-collision route can be estimated. This is achieved by grouping together neighboring water superpixels (considered as \u201cregions of interest\u201d). Finally, we use a model-free robust control scheme that allows the robot to autonomously navigate through the free-collision routes obtained in the first step. The experimental results, both in simulations and in practice, show the effectiveness of the proposed navigation system.",

        "abstract": "Road and lane detection play an important role in autonomous driving and commercial driver-assistance systems. Vision-based road detection is an essential step towards autonomous driving, yet a challenging task due to illumination and complexity of the visual scenery. Urban scenes may present additional challenges such as intersections, multi-lane scenarios, or clutter due to heavy traffic. This paper presents an integrative approach to ego-lane detection that aims to be as simple as possible to enable real-time computation while being able to adapt to a variety of urban and rural traffic scenarios. The approach at hand combines and extends a road segmentation method in an illumination-invariant color image, lane markings detection using a ridge operator, and road geometry estimation using RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC). Employing the segmented road region as a prior for lane markings extraction significantly improves the execution time and success rate of the RANSAC algorithm, and makes the detection of weakly pronounced ridge structures computationally tractable, thus enabling ego-lane detection even in the absence of lane markings. Segmentation performance is shown to increase when moving from a color-based to a histogram correlation-based model. The power and robustness of this algorithm has been demonstrated in a car simulation system as well as in the challenging KITTI data base of real-world urban traffic scenarios.",

We achieve using it to enable autonomous navigation of a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) in unknown environments. The methodology behind this system can easily be extended to multi-camera rigs, if the onboard computation capability allows this. We analyze the iterative optimizations for pose tracking and map refinement of the SLAM system in multicamera cases. This ensures the soundness and accuracy of each optimization update. Our method is more resistant to tracking failure than conventional monocular visual SLAM systems, especially when MAVs fly in complex environments. It also brings more flexibility to configurations of multiple cameras used onboard of MAVs. We demonstrate its efficiency with both autonomous flight and manual flight of a MAV. The results are evaluated by comparisons with ground truth data provided by an external tracking system.",

In this study, we developed a visual attention model for manipulating human attention by a robot. The model consists of two modules, such as the saliency map generation module and manipulation map generation module. The saliency map describes the bottom-up effect of visual stimuli on human attention and the manipulation map describes the top-down effect of face, hands and gaze. In order to evaluate the proposed attention model, we measured human gaze points during watching a magic video, and applied the attention model to the video. Based on the result of this experiment, the proposed attention model can better explain human visual attention than the original saliency map.",

Our approach consists of data pre-clustering using coresets followed by a graph based incremental clustering procedure using a topic based image representation. A coreset for an image stream is a set of representative images that semantically compresses the data corpus, in the sense that every frame has a similar representative image in the coreset. We prove that our algorithm efficiently computes the smallest possible coreset under natural well-defined similarity metric and up to provably small approximation factor. The output visual summary is computed via a hierarchical tree of coresets for different parts of the image stream. This allows multi-resolution summarization (or a video summary of specified duration) in the batch setting and a memory-efficient incremental summary for the streaming case.",

        "abstract": "Snake robots are uniquely qualified to investigate a large variety of settings including archaeological sites, natural disaster zones, and nuclear power plants. For these applications, modular snake robots have been tele-operated to perform specific tasks using images returned to it from an onboard camera in the robots head. In order to give the operator an even richer view of the environment and to enable the robot to perform autonomous tasks we developed a structured light sensor that can make three-dimensional maps of the environment. This paper presents a sensor that is uniquely qualified to meet the severe constraints in size, power and computational footprint of snake robots. Using range data, in the form of 3D pointclouds, we show that it is possible to pair high-level planning with mid-level control to accomplish complex tasks without operator intervention.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents two visual servoing approaches for nanopositioning in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The first approach uses the total pixel intensities of an image as visual measurements for designing the control law. The positioning error and the platform control are directly linked with the intensity variations. The second approach is a frequency domain method that uses Fourier transform to compute the relative motion between images. In this case, the control law is designed to minimize the error i.e. the 2D motion between current and desired images by controlling the positioning platform movement. Both methods are validated at different experimental conditions for a task of positioning silicon microparts using a piezo-positioning platform. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the developed methods.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper analyzes the observability properties of the visual inertial structure from motion as the number of inertial sensors is reduced. Specifically, instead of considering the standard formulation where the inertial sensors are 3 orthogonal accelerometers and 3 orthogonal gyroscopes, the sensor system here considered only consists of a monocular camera and 1 or 2 accelerometers. This analysis has never been provided before. The main result achieved in this context is that the observability properties of visual inertial structure from motion do not change by removing all the 3 gyroscopes and 1 accelerometer. By removing a further accelerometer, if the camera is not extrinsically calibrated, the system loses part of its observability properties. On the other hand, if the camera is extrinsically calibrated, the system maintains the same observability properties as in the standard case. This contribution clearly shows that the information provided by a monocular camera, 3 accelerometers and 3 gyroscopes is redundant. Additionally, it provides a new perspective in the framework of neuroscience to the process of vestibular and visual integration for depth perception and self motion perception. Finally, to analyze these systems with a reduced number of inertial sensors, the paper introduces a new method to derive the observability properties of a non linear system when part of its input controls is unknown. This method is a further original paper contribution in control theory.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel volumetric multi-resolution mapping system for RGB-D images that runs on a standard CPU in real-time. Our approach generates a textured triangle mesh from a signed distance function that it continuously updates as new RGB-D images arrive. We propose to use an octree as the primary data structure which allows us to represent the scene at multiple scales. Furthermore, it allows us to grow the reconstruction volume dynamically. As most space is either free or unknown, we allocate and update only those voxels that are located in a narrow band around the observed surface. In contrast to a regular grid, this approach saves enormous amounts of memory and computation time. The major challenge is to generate and maintain a consistent triangle mesh, as neighboring cells in the octree are more difficult to find and may have different resolutions. To remedy this, we present in this paper a novel algorithm that keeps track of these dependencies, and efficiently updates corresponding parts of the triangle mesh. In our experiments, we demonstrate the real-time capability on a large set of RGB-D sequences. As our approach does not require a GPU, it is well suited for applications on mobile or flying robots with limited computational resources.",

        "abstract": "Localization approaches typically rely on an already available map to identify the position of the sensor in the environment. Such maps are usually built beforehand and often require the user to record data from the same sensor used for localization. In this paper, we relax this assumption and present a localization approach based on architectural floor plans. In general, floor plans are readily available for most man-made buildings but only represent basic architectural structures. The incomplete knowledge leads to ambiguous pose estimates. To solve this problem, we present W-RGB-D, a new method for indoor global localization based on WiFi and an RGB-D camera. We introduce a sensor model for RGB-D cameras that is suitable to be used with abstract floor plans. To resolve ambiguities during global localization, we estimate a coarse initial distribution about the sensor position using the WiFi signal strength. We evaluate our W-RGB-D localization method in indoor environments and compare its performance with RGB-D-based Monte Carlo localization. Our results demonstrate that the use of WiFi information as proposed with our approach improves the localization in terms of convergence speed and quality of the solution.",

        "abstract": "A load sensor with high sensitivity, a wide measurement range, and a small size was developed by using an AT-cut quartz crystal resonator (QCR). The quartz crystal generates a charge that is proportional to the external force. Because it has high sensitivity and excellent temperature stability, it has been used for various sensors. In particular, a QCR has an inherently superior static-load-sensing characteristic. However, a QCR is fragile and easily broken by a stress concentration. Moreover, a retention mechanism is required to efficiently transmit the load, and it is necessary to fix the QCR firmly to avoid a horizontal force. Moreover, it is very difficult to miniaturize the retention mechanism because the fabrication and assembly process is complicated. We previously proposed a miniaturized sensor element that was developed using microfabrication. The QCR load sensor had an enormously wide force-sensing range of greater than 104 N. However, the output was easily affected by a change in the parasitic capacitance around the QCR. The objective of this study was to improve the load-measurement resolution and stabilize the sensor output for application to biological signal detection. We fabricated a QCR sensor with a sensitivity of 973 Hz/N and succeeded in detecting multiple biological signals (respiration, heartbeat, and posture) with using proposed QCR load sensor.",

The joints or spinal discs are usually the weak points due to the high stress they are exposed to, e. g. when lifting heavy objects. One way to circumvent the necessity of large motors is to use parallel mechanisms to optimize the distribution of loads. Here, we analyze the workspace of the humanoid robot Rollin' Justin of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) w. r. t. the constraints imposed by kinematic coupling of torso joints via tendons. The results of the analysis can be used for planning and reactive control to efficiently exploit the torso performance capabilities of the robotic system. As an application, we design a potential field based controller to avoid violating these constraints and implement it on the real robot.",

In case of emergency stops, large and possibly harmful accelerations can occur. This paper aims to provide an optimization procedure to generate worst case trajectories in order to test for these harmful accelerations, by maximizing the kinetic energy prior the emergency stop. The dynamical and mechanical limits of the robot are considered as constraints of the optimization criterion. An exemplary worst case trajectory is simulated using a braking model and the resulting Head Injury Criterion (HIC) is calculated and compared with older tests, using non-optimized trajectories. A significant higher, yet with the current robot dynamics not harmful HIC value can be generated.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel robotic fish, iSplash-I, with full-body coordination and high performance carangiform swimming motion. The proposed full-body length swimming motion coordinates anterior, mid-body and posterior displacements in an attempt to reduce the large kinematic errors in the existing free swimming robotic fish. It optimizes forces around the center of mass and initiates the starting moment of added mass upstream. A novel mechanical drive system was devised operating in the two swimming patterns. Experimental results show, that the proposed carangiform swimming motion approach has significantly outperformed the traditional posterior confined undulatory swimming pattern approach in terms of the speed measured in body lengths/ second, achieving a maximum velocity of 3.4BL/s and consistently generating a velocity of 2.8BL/s at 6.6Hz.",

        "title": "vi-RABT: Virtually Interfaced Robotic Ankle and Balance Trainer",
        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Each year in the US, 628,000 people suffer an ankle sprain, and 795,000 suffer a new or recurrent stroke. Due to improved survival rates after stroke, significant increases in stroke population are projected by 2030. So far, there is no cost-effective robotic ankle/balance trainer in the market. In this paper, we present the Virtually-Interfaced Robotic Ankle and Balance Trainer (vi-RABT), a low-cost robotic system that will improve overall ankle / balance strength, mobility and control. The system is equipped with 2 degrees of freedom (DOF) controlled actuation along with complete means of force and angular measurements. The preliminary results on a single robotic footplate confirm the system design. The system will be used for measurement of ankle kinematics, ankle kinetics and balance function, as well as for retraining motor control and strength of the ankle during plantarflexion / dorsiflexion (PF/DF), ankle inversion / eversion (IN/EV) and circumduction motions.",
