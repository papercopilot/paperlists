        "abstract": "Accurate estimation of camera motion is very important for many robotics applications involving SfM and visual SLAM. Such accuracy is attempted by refining the estimated motion through nonlinear optimization. As many modern robots are equipped with both 2D and 3D cameras, it is both highly desirable and challenging to exploit data acquired from both modalities to achieve a better localization. Existing refinement methods, such as Bundle adjustment and loop closing, may be employed only when precise 2D-to-3D correspondences across frames are available. In this paper, we propose a framework for robot localization that benefits from both 2D and 3D information without requiring such accurate correspondences to be established. This is carried out through a 2D-3D based initial motion estimation followed by a constrained nonlinear optimization for motion refinement. The initial motion estimation finds the best possible 2D-to-3D correspondences and localizes the cameras with respect the 3D scene. The refinement step minimizes the projection errors of 3D points while preserving the existing relationships between images. The problems of occlusion and that of missing scene parts are handled by comparing the image-based reconstruction and 3D sensor measurements. The effect of data inaccuracies is minimized using an M-estimator based technique. Our experiments have demonstrated that the proposed framework allows to obtain a good initial motion estimate and a significant improvement through refinement.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The goal of reproducing human-like dynamic running remains a challenge for roboticists. Some robots, such as the bipedal RHex, have achieved basic features of dynamic running with hip-driven springy-legs that are similar to above-knee amputee running with prostheses. However, little is currently understood about the 3D dynamics governing such robots, and current robots still remain far from achieving human-like dynamics and stability. One apparent difference between the bipedal RHex robot and human runners is their step width: human runners, including above-knee amputees, run with footfalls close to the body centerline. Here we study the effects of varying step width on the 3D running stability of a bipedal amputee-inspired robot. The robot has a PD controller for pitch and no control for yaw or roll, based on that used for the bipedal RHex robot. We begin with a step width close to shoulder width, and then study the effects of decreasing the step width. We discovered that as the step width is decreased, yaw stability decreases and roll stability is lost corresponding with a qualitative change in a dimensionless roll inertia number. Due to this, the robot is unable to achieve human-like step widths. This implies that additional roll and yaw control may be required for stable locomotion with such narrow step widths. This discovery provides an early understanding of bipedal running dynamics and some early design guidelines for bipedal robots.",

We were motivated by the demand to efficiently and automatically acquire the position and orientation of a steadily growing number of artificial skin sensor elements. Here, we combine our 3D surface reconstruction algorithm for individual patches of artificial skin, with a common active visual marker approach. Light emitting diodes, built into every element of our modular artificial skin, enable us to turn each reconstructed patch of skin into an active 6 DoF visual marker.With the help of a calibrated monocular camera, we can then estimate the homogeneous transformations between multiple, at least partially visible skin patches e.g. when distributed on the body of a robot. Our approach allows to quickly combine distributed tactile and visual coordinate systems into one homogeneous rigid body representation. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach by calibrating several patches mounted on a robot arm using only a standard web-cam.",

In this paper, we describe a system that enables the deployment of an autonomous underwater vehicle in 3D environments proximal to the ocean bottom. Unlike many previous approaches, our solution: uses oscillating hydrofoil propulsion; allows for stable control of the robot's motion and sensor directions; allows human operators to specify detailed trajectories in a natural fashion; and has been successfully demonstrated as a holistic system in the open ocean near both coral reefs and a sunken cargo ship. A key component of our system is the 3D control of a hexapod swimming robot, which can move the vehicle through agile sequences of orientations despite challenging marine conditions. We present two methods to easily generate robot trajectories appropriate for deployments in close proximity to challenging contours of the sea floor. Both offline recording of trajectories using augmented reality and online placement of fiducial tags in the marine environment are shown to have desirable properties, with complementary strengths and weaknesses. Finally, qualitative and quantitative results of the 3D control system are presented.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents new methods to control humanoid turns while running, through the use of a 3D-SLIP template model with steering control. The work builds on a previous controller for straight-ahead running and describes the new methods that enable online humanoid steering for different speeds and turn rates. As opposed to previous research which has studied 3D-SLIP steering with a monopod model, motion optimization for the SLIP here enforces leg separation. This leg separation gives rise to body sway in forward running and allows the template to capture the unique roles that the inside and outside legs each play during a high-speed turn. The trajectory optimization approach for this template is given, and the resultant CoM trajectories are characterized. Modifications to a previous controller for straight-ahead running are shown to enable running turns in a simulated humanoid model. The methods allow the humanoid to change its turn rate and direction from step to step and enable execution of a high-speed turn with a radius that is one fourth that of a standard 400m track. A video attachment to this paper shows the humanoid turning while running at up to 4.0 m/s, and highlights its ability to maintain balance in spite of push disturbances.",

One of the main contributions of this article is a novel stereo camera model which employs virtual orthogonal cameras to map 6D Cartesian poses defined in the Task space to 6D visual poses defined in a Virtual Visual space (Image space). This new model is used to compute a full-rank square Image Jacobian matrix (Jimg), which solves several common problems exhibited by the classical image Jacobians, e.g., Image space singularities and local minima. This Jacobian is a fundamental key for the image-based controller design, where a chattering-free adaptive second order sliding mode is employed to track 6D visual motions for a robot manipulator. Exponential convergence of errors in both spaces without local minima are demonstrated. The complete control system is experimentally evaluated on a real industrial robot. The robustness of the control scheme is evaluated for cases where the extrinsic parameters of the uncalibrated stereo camera system are changed on-line and unknown when the stereo system is manually moved to obtain a clearer view of the task.",

Firstly, we introduce and evaluate a closed loop control scheme by which it is possible to align the gripper to objects or features of the environment using proximity values alone. We call this control method proximity servoing. It is implemented by equilibrating the sensor signals, resulting in a robust preshape in all 6DOF of the object pose. Objects can then be grasped with virtually no displacement. Secondly, also based on proximity servoing, we demonstrate and evaluate novel ideas for combined haptic and proximity-based exploration. Without any cues from an external camera the system is capable of detecting and exploring features such as curvatures, edges or corners of objects. It is also shown that tactile and proximity exploration steps can be used complementarily to increase efficiency in exploration while delivering accurate object measurements.",

Whereas conventional motion planning approaches define the body shape of snake robots in terms of their individual joint angles, the proposed framework allows the body shape to be specified in terms of Cartesian coordinates in the environment of the robot. This approach simplifies motion planning since Cartesian coordinates are more intuitively mapped to the overall body shape of the snake robot. The paper demonstrates the applicability of the framework for realizing different types of three-dimensional motion patterns.",

        "abstract": "Humanoid robots can be a highly desirable substitute for humans when it performs various tasks using tools and equipment designed for humans. One of such possible applications is controlling a vehicle. A humanoid robot can sit in the pilot's seat and command the vehicle using the control columns or steering wheels, pedals, switches, levers, and dials. In this paper, we propose a framework of automating a vehicle, an airplane in particular, with a humanoid. In order to perform various tasks of flying an unmodified airplane, the robot needs to perform three levels of tasks - recognition, decision, and action. The robot should collect information of the vehicle by using its own sensors and from various instruments in the cockpit, in addition to possible data link, a privilege of a robot. The robot then decides how to operate the flight control equipment in order to follow a given flight plan. Finally, it directly manipulates the control input equipment by computing the kinematic variables in the presence of various constraints from the surroundings. In order to validate the proposed framework, a piloting robot system is developed using a small low-cost humanoid and a flight simulation equipment designed for humans. The robot showed adequate performance to fly the airplane from cold start to landing to a stop on the runway.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a biomechanical model for tissue deformations in the case of tangential micro-probe scanning for image acquisition. The tissue is modelled as a rigid body and its deformations - considered as elastic - as springs between this body and a fixed reference body. The contact between the probe and the tissue is then considered as a Hertzian sphere-plane contact with a Coulomb friction force. Given those hypotheses, an analytical model of the tissue deformations for 2D tangential movements along the locally planar tissue surface can be established. Similarly to the work of Erden et al. [1], the model has a unique parameter: the loading distance of the tissue. For given scan conditions, this parameter can be calibrated with a simple back-and-forth movement and image measurements. It is of particular interest in minimally invasive surgery where measurements of the friction forces or of the mechanical parameters of the tissue are complex to carry out. Simulations are in accordance with experiments and show that this model allows for accurate estimation of the probe/tissue trajectory in one dimension scans. Moreover, unlike previous studies, the model allows the estimation of the probe/tissue trajectory also for 2D scans. Both coupling behaviour and stick/slip transitions when scanning direction changes are taken into account. However experiments show that anisotropy is an important parameter when studying 2D coupling behaviour. Therefore, an extension of the model that takes anisotropic behaviour of the tissue into account is proposed. Experiments carried out on ex vivo bovine liver and chicken muscle tissues show that the probe/tissue trajectory is accurately predicted by the model. However, this increases the number of parameters to five. As a consequence, unlike in the isotropic case, the parameters can not be simply calibrated using a back-and-forth movement. Further work will be carried out towards finding an easy and effective calibration procedure t... Show More",

We describe how to estimate the extrinsic calibration parameters of the modified sensor using a standard parametrization and a reduced one that exploits the properties of the setup. Our experimental evaluation on real-world data demonstrates the robustness of the calibration procedure. Additionally, we show that our proposed sensor modification substantially improves the accuracy and the robustness in a simultaneous localization and mapping task.",

The proposed algorithm is a decentralized implementation of a centralized Extended Kalman Filter for cooperative localization. In this algorithm, instead of propagating cross-covariance terms, each robot propagates new intermediate local variables that can be used in an update stage to create the required propagated cross-covariance terms. Whenever there is a relative measurement in the network, the algorithm declares the robot making this measurement as the interim master. By acquiring information from the interim landmark, the robot the relative measurement is taken from, the interim master can calculate and broadcast a set of intermediate variables which each robot can then use to update its estimates to match that of a centralized Extended Kalman Filter for cooperative localization. Once an update is done, no further communication is needed until the next relative measurement. The communication graph can be a time-varying directed graph with the only requirement that it should have a spanning tree rooted at the interim master.",

        "abstract": "The term Programmable Matter (PM) describes the class of future meta-materials of programmable and controllable properties and behavior, e.g., able to autonomously transform into an arbitrary shape. The robotic approaches towards PM are based on the concept of cooperation of millions of micro-robots (modules), acting at a very fine length-scale and collectively imitating deformation of a macroscopically continuous material. Recent ideas about reconfiguration of a collective of modules to obtain a desired overall mechanical response are promising. However, they are limited by the strength of individual connections between modules. In the present work, we propose a way of arranging spherical modules into microstructures, in which some connections are fixed and mechanically stronger, and the rest are active (reconfigurable) but weaker. If the fixed connections are sufficiently strong, the proposed microstructures perform the function of collective actuation by exerting forces proportional to their volumes. Two variants of a linear-actuator microstructure are presented and studied in more detail. A rotary-actuator microstructure is also introduced.",

We compute directly on the state space of the system, avoiding the expensive pre-computation of a discrete abstraction. An automaton that corresponds to the temporal logic specification guides the computation of a control policy that maximizes the probability that the system satisfies the specification. This reduces controller synthesis to solving a sequence of stochastic constrained reachability problems. Each individual reachability problem is solved via the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation of stochastic optimal control theory. To increase the efficiency of our approach, we exploit a class of systems where the HJB equation is linear due to structural assumptions on the noise. The linearity of the partial differential equation allows us to pre-compute control policy primitives and then compose them, at essentially zero cost, to conservatively satisfy a complex temporal logic specification.",

The connectivity of a graph plays a critical role in dynamic networks of multiple agents since it represents a level of information sharing capability of a system. The connectivity of a network of unmanned systems changes as the state dependent graph evolves over time, revealing the risk of the system being uncontrollable during null connectivity. We show that the existing formation controller fails to make the formation when the network connectivity is lost. We propose a novel formation control strategy which keeps the multi-agent graph connected throughout the system dynamic process. The convergence of the formation controller is shown with the help of the Lyapunov theory. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control law.",

        "abstract": "Visual coverage of large scale environments is a challenging problem that has many practical applications such as large scale 3D reconstruction, search and rescue and active video surveillance. In this paper, we consider a setting where mobile robots must acquire visual information using standard cameras, while minimizing associated movement costs. The main source of complexity for such scenario is the lack of a priori knowledge of 3D structures for the surrounding environment. To address this problem, we propose a novel descriptor for visual coverage that aims at measuring the orientation dependent visual information of an area, based on a regular discretization of the 3D environment in voxels. Next, we use the proposed visual descriptor to define an autonomous cooperative exploration approach, which controls the robot movements so to maximize information accuracy and minimizing movement costs. We empirically evaluate our approach in a simulation scenario based on real data for large scale 3D environments, and on widely used robotic tools (such as ROS and Stage). Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms a baseline random approach and an uncoordinated one, thus being a valid proposal for visual coverage in large scale outdoor scenarios.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of designing distributed control algorithms to solve the rendezvous problem for multi-robot systems with limited sensing, for situation in which random nodes may fail during execution. We first formulate a distributed solution based upon averaging algorithms that have been reported in the consensus literature. In this case, at each stage of execution a 1-step sequential optimal control (i.e., na\u00efve greedy algorithm) is used. We show that by choosing an appropriate constraint set, finite-time point convergence is guaranteed. We then propose a distributed stochastic optimal control algorithm that minimizes a mean-variance cost function for each stage, given that the probability distribution for possible node failures is known a priori. We show via simulation results that our algorithm provides competitive rendezvous task performance in comparison to that of the classical circumcenter algorithm for cases in which there are no node failures. Then we show, via examples with multiple node failures, that our proposed algorithm provides better rendezvous task performance than contemporary algorithms in cases for which failures occur. Additionally, we generate and compare a spectrum of results by varying the probabilities of node failures, or varying the weight value for the variance term in the cost functional. The results suggest that by choosing the design parameters appropriately, one may adjust the degree of soft constraints of the controller as well.",

A dynamically consistent hierarchical architecture is proposed, where an explicit Cartesian force control arises as the primary task while orientation control is designed in the null space. Cartesian force control, driven by position errors, establishes the interaction dynamics between probe and patient, implemented with computed torque control techniques in the task space. Probe orientation is controlled at joint level, where motion control is driven by task space orientation errors converted into joint velocity references. Control performance is boosted by Kalman active observers (AOBs). Experiments with a 7-DOF WAM\u2122 validate the architecture, where an ultrasound probe is teleoperated in 6 Cartesian dimensions, executing typical echographic tasks.",

We have created a platform-agnostic method for low-cost tracking of surgical tool shafts in Cartesian space in near real time. We employ a joint Hough Transform - Geometric Constraint approach to locate the tool tips in the stereo camera channels independently. Cartesian coordinates are registered using a custom polynomial depth - disparity model. The algorithm was developed using a low-cost experimental webcam setup and evaluated using a da Vinci surgical endoscope. The algorithm was benchmarked for 3D tracking accuracy and computational speed. The system can locate the tool tip in 3D space with an average accuracy of 3.05 mm at 25.86 frames per second using the webcam setup. For the endoscope setup this algorithm has an average tracking accuracy of 8.68 mm in 3D and 1.88 mm in 2D with an average frame rate of 26.9 FPS. The algorithm also demonstrated successful tracking of tools using captured video from a real surgical procedure.",

In this paper, a fish-like locomotion model is developed in an ideal fluid with a background flow estimation algorithm inspired by the lateral line system. Specifically, the fish model is geometrically formulated with the Joukowski transformation and is dynamically defined as a deformable solid body. Describing the fluid-body interactions is a hydrodynamic model that incorporates the potential flow theory with a shedding mechanism of discrete vortices. With the hydrodynamic information on the boundary of the fish-like profile, the background flow field can be estimated with a modified vortex panel method. Base on the estimation, the control decision can potentially be adjusted accordingly, which may improve the swimming performance. Furthermore, in the profile model, body segments are defined such that the internal forces can be easily obtained for quantitative efficiency evaluation.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Pectoral fins are important actuation mechanisms in achieving maneuvering and propulsion for robotic fish. Existing designs predominantly adopt a rigid joint connecting the actuator to the pectoral fin, which requires differential actuation speeds in the power and recovery strokes in order to produce thrust and thus limits the overall actuation frequency. To address this problem, in this paper we propose a novel design of a flexible joint, which enables the pectoral fin to sweep back passively along the fish body in the recovery stroke, to minimize the drag, while maintaining the prescribed motion in the power stroke. A dynamic model is presented for a robotic fish propelled by pectoral fins incorporating such flexible joints, where the pectoral fin mechanism is modeled by two rigid segments connected with a pair of torsional spring and damper. This design results in a net thrust even with the same recovery and power stroke speed within each fin beat cycle, which simplifies the fin control. Experimental results on a robotic fish prototype are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, and to demonstrate the significant advantage of the proposed fin joint over the rigid joint. Furthermore, modeling analysis and experimental investigation are used to examine the influence of the joint length and stiffness on the locomotion performance.",

In many practical applications, tasks could be fulfilled even though the robot does not achieve a perfect matching with a given quantitative objective. Thus, it could be possible to carry out other activities, mildly conflicting with the current goal, yet providing benefits for the overall execution of a complex sequence of tasks. This paper proposes i) a criteria to evaluate the execution of a monitored task, ii) an enriched task specification to express the tolerance with which a goal is fulfilled, so that iii) a sequence of tasks can be executed concurrently, on the basis of monitored quantities. Furthermore, the paper reports a classification of conflicting scenarios for a finer selection of the scheduler policy. Finally, results from experimental scenarios show the potential benefits of the proposed methodology.",

        "abstract": "While many methodologies have been proposed for calculating a quantitative level of autonomy for intelligent Unmanned Systems (UMS), no one definitive measure of autonomy or autonomous performance has been validated and adopted by the UMS community. Particularly for military applications, a simple performance metric that is based on the UMSs mission profile and is comparable between UMS systems is critical. This metric would not only help define the features a UMS needs to successfully perform its mission, both in terms of hardware and software, but also enable the use of UMS for a broader range of applications at an increased level of autonomy. This paper presents the development of a new methodology for calculating a single-number performance metric for autonomous UMS, and this metric is called the Mission Performance Potential (MPP). Rather than a retroactive measure of UMS performance and autonomy level for one iteration of a given scenario, the MPP separates autonomy level and mission performance to provide a predictive measure of a UMS's expected performance for a mission set and level of autonomy. As an example application, the MPP is calculated for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) performing a target tracking mission, and this MPP value is compared to the results of field-testing with this system.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel robotics-assisted rehabilitation framework is proposed for bilateral mirror-image therapy. For this purpose, a customized dual-user teleoperation architecture is designed incorporating Guidance Virtual Fixtures (GVFs) to deliver the appropriate therapeutic movements to the patient's impaired limb by providing an assist-as-needed treatment strategy. In addition, the therapist is provided with informative haptic feedback that is generated based on the patient's movements, allowing the therapist to decide in real-time on the level and format of the therapy required for the patient. Stability of the closed-loop system is also investigated using the small gain theorem, in the presence of communication time delays, facilitating the case of remote tele-rehabilitation. Experimental results are given to validate the performance of the proposed platform.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a gesture recognition framework designed for controlling mobile robots using dynamic hand gestures. The system is unique in that it can be trained to recognize a new gesture by simply demonstrating the gesture once. From then on, the system improves its recognition accuracy over time by learning from experience. The classification scheme utilizes a nearest neighbor approach with a dynamic time warping distance metric. The approach robustly handles both temporal and spatial variations in executions of highly dynamic and complex gestures. One product of the research is an open source software package that will work with little to no modifications on robots utilizing a 3D depth sensor and the Robot Operating System (ROS). Experimental results show the ability of novice users to train and utilize the system effectively, as well as the system's ability to increase its recognition accuracy over time by learning from experience.",

In our previous work, the old system consists of one pan-tilt unit(PTU) with two cameras, whose detection range is limited by the baseline. To achieve long-range detection and cover wide field of regard, we mounted two separate sets of PTU integrated with visible light camera on both sides of the runway instead of our previous assembled stereo vision system. Then, the well-known AdaBoost method was evaluated with regard to detecting and tracking the target. To achieve the relative position between the UAV and landing area, we used triangulation to calculate the 3D coordinates of the UAV. By combining the estimated position in the closed loop control, we obtain the autonomous landing strategy. Finally, we present several real flights in outdoor environments, and compare its accuracy with ground truth provided by GNSS. The results support the validity and accuracy of the presented system.",

        "abstract": "Coordinating fleets of autonomous, non-holonomic vehicles is paramount to many industrial applications. While there exists solutions to efficiently calculate trajectories for individual vehicles, an effective methodology to coordinate their motions and to avoid deadlocks is still missing. Decoupled approaches, where motions are calculated independently for each vehicle and then centrally coordinated for execution, have the means to identify deadlocks, but not to solve all of them. We present a novel approach that overcomes this limitation and that can be used to complement the deficiencies of decoupled solutions with centralized coordination. Here, we formally define an extension of the framework of lattice-based motion planning to multi-robot systems and we validate it experimentally. Our approach can jointly plan for multiple vehicles and it generates kinematically feasible and deadlock-free motions.",

Using only standard web technologies, our application provides a rich 3D interface that displays the robot's pose, orientation, and sensor data, and can update at 30Hz. It is easy to use, because there is no software for the user to install; it runs using the device's mobile browser.

This corresponds to the typical situation of a mono-camera/IMU sensor facing a (locally) planar environment. By lifting the estimation state space to a higher-dimensionnal space, we show that the problem can be formulated as a linear estimation problem. This allows for the application of classical estimation techniques, e.g., Kalman filtering. Based on this linear formulation, we also determine explicitly the motion conditions that ensure uniform observability of the system, and we propose a simple linear Luenberger-like observer. A validation of the proposed solution based on real data is presented.",

The transmission fluid working volume is completely sealed, forming a closed, passive system, ensuring input-output symmetry and complete backdrivability. Rolling diaphragm-sealed cylinders provide leak-free operation without the stiction of a traditional sliding seal. Fluid pressure preloading allows for bidirectional operation and also serves to preload the gears or belts in the linear-to-rotary output coupler, eliminating system backlash end-to-end. A prototype transmission is built and tested for stiffness, bandwidth, and frictional properties using either air or water as working fluids. Torque transmission is smooth over the entire stroke and stiction is measured to be one percent of full-range torque or less. We also present a tendon-coupled design where the rolling diaphragm is inverted from its normal orientation; this design does not require shaft support bushings, tolerates misalignment, and can be made out of substantially soft materials. Actuator units and a passive transmission are demonstrated using this new soft cylinder design.",

        "abstract": "Assessing reachability for a dynamical system, that is deciding whether a certain state is reachable from a given initial state within a given cost threshold, is a central concept in controls, robotics, and optimization. Direct approaches to assess reachability involve the solution to a two-point boundary value problem (2PBVP) between a pair of states. Alternative, indirect approaches involve the characterization of reachable sets as level sets of the value function of an appropriate optimal control problem. Both methods solve the problem accurately, but are computationally intensive and do no appear amenable to real-time implementation for all but the simplest cases. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to devise query-based algorithms for the approximate, yet real-time solution of the reachability problem. Specifically, we show that with a training set of pre-solved 2PBVP problems, one can accurately classify the cost-reachable sets of a differentially-constrained system using either (1) locally-weighted linear regression or (2) support vector machines. This novel, query-based approach is demonstrated on two systems: the Dubins car and a deep-space spacecraft. Classification errors on the order of 10% (and often significantly less) are achieved with average execution times on the order of milliseconds, representing 4 orders-of-magnitude improvement over exact methods. The proposed algorithms could find application in a variety of time-critical robotic applications, where the driving factor is computation time rather than optimality.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of the joint mission planning in teams of heterogeneous physical agents. The type of missions that we consider are composed of spatially distributed tasks that need to be selected and assigned to the agents for dealing with them. A plan consists of a set of directives specifying who does what, where, when, and for how long. The aim is to optimize system-level performance by explicitly taking into account and exploiting the different sensory-motor characteristics of the agents. We tackle this general problem by proposing a mixed integer linear formulation of it which includes several aspects/constraints that closely model features and requests of realistic scenarios. We present a solution approach based on the combination of a metaheuristic and mathematical programming method that allows to compute high-quality plans within short time, and with formal guarantees on their optimality. The application of the framework is validated in the context of search and rescue missions.",

COWALK, which is a gait rehabilitation robot under development in our institute, is capable of pelvic motion training. In this paper, we describe a statistical method to generate pelvic motion which is considered to fit each person, i.e., personalized pelvic motion. We measured 14 anthropometric features of human and captured gait motion using an optical motion capture system from 113 healthy subjects. We setup a database of gait motion and body measurements; we define a 4 dimensional compact vector representation of pelvic motion, and body meta-feature, which is a weighted linear combination of the anthropometric measurements, to maximize statistical correlation between the former and the latter. To synthesize a personalized pelvic motion for a new subject, we search for k nearest neighbors in the space of body meta-feature (k-NN algorithm), and average the pelvic motions of them. We validate the algorithm using the database of 113 subjects by excluding each person, synthesizing a personalized pelvic motion for the subject, and comparing it with actual motion of the subject.",

        "abstract": "To robustly operate in dynamic, unknown environments, robots should be able to autonomously recover from simple errors such as tip-over. Most efforts to date have introduced specific techniques applied as point solutions on simple terrain. For a more general solution, we previously introduced a framework for analyzing and generating solutions to the self-righting problem for a generic robot. In this paper, we turn our attention toward understanding how a robot's morphology affects its ability to self-right. We begin by briefly reviewing our framework, which is used to generate the results within the paper. We then introduce a self-rightability metric that can be used to evaluate a given robot design's potential for self-righting. It can also be used to compare disparate designs. Next, we show how the metric can be used to perform a parametric study covering multiple design variables for a simple robot class. In this way, we hope to enable designers to begin to understand how design parameters such as joint limits, limb length, limb to body mass ratio, limb mass location, and body aspect ratio will affect the robot's ability to self-right on a variety of ground angles. Finally, we show a case study of limb mass and validate results using a modular, 3 degree of freedom physical robot. Ultimately, we hope to enable the production of robots that are more capable of autonomously self-righting.",

In the proposed framework, we assume that an autonomous system can plan and execute robotic tasks while a human operator can provide interventions when necessary receiving a force feedback. The haptic feedback is associated with the sensation about how the system is diverging from the planned operations. We tested the system at work in virtual and real environments considering simple navigation tasks. We compared the performance of human operators with or without the assistance of the force feedback. The collected results support the hypothesis that the proposed approach enables effective and intuitive mixed-initiative control.",

A newly developed motion model that better accounts for multiple hypotheses of the motion of a tagged fish is used to increase the robustness of the state-estimator. A series of multi-AUV shark tracks were conducted at Santa Catalina Island, California over the span of four days to demonstrate the ability of the state-estimator to determine the 3D position of a tagged leopard shark. Additional experiments in which the AUVs tracked a tagged boat of known location were conducted to quantify the performance of the presented state-estimator. Experimental results demonstrate a three-fold decrease in mean state-estimation error compared to previous works.",

It has been used to solve complex, high-dimensional problems in robotics and structural biology. In this paper, we propose a multiple-tree variant of T-RRT, named Multi-T-RRT. It is especially useful to solve ordering-and-pathfinding problems, i.e. to compute a path going through several unordered way-points. Using the Multi-T-RRT, such problems can be solved from a purely geometrical perspective, without having to use a symbolic task planner. We evaluate the Multi-T-RRT on several path planning problems and compare it to other path planners. Finally, we apply the Multi-T-RRT to a concrete industrial inspection problem involving an aerial robot.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Pneumatic actuators have been widely utilized in industrial robots and in welfare apparatuses, for example with their advantages of light weight, low cost, safety, and high compliance. However, driving them needs not only the air supply line from compressor but also many electrical lines from controller to valve, making the pneumatic drive system complicated. This research proposes a new control method for the deletion of electrical control lines in pneumatic mechatronics. This method needs two technical challenges; acoustic communication system and power supply device for each local module. First, we explain the outline of a multiplex pneumatic actuator drive method. Secondly, acoustic communication system using a microcomputer (PSoC) is shown, where carrier frequency is optimized with a basic experiment. Thirdly, the design of a power supply device is shown with experimental results. Finally, a multiplex pneumatic actuator drive method is constructed with the acoustic communication system and power supply device. This prototype system works very well to show the great potential of this proposed control method. It controls successfully three pneumatic cylinders independently which are connected with an air supply line of 10[m].",

Inspired by theories of human embodied cognition, the entire architecture is essentially one big dynamical system from which discrete events such as initiating and terminating reaches and grasps emerge through dynamical instabilities. Using a Kinect sensor as input, we implement the architecture on a Kuka light weight arm with a Schunk Dextrous Hand and demonstrate grasping movements that are updated on-line when the object is shifted or rotated during movement planning or execution.",

        "abstract": "The class of Pneumatically-driven Lower-pressure Soft Actuators (PLSA) is a popular research topic as it can be potentially used in the surgical robotic applications. One fundamental problem lying in the PLSA research is the lack of a generally validated model for the complex nonlinear dynamic behaviours. In this paper, a new coefficient-adaptive orthonormal basis function model structure is specifically developed for the identification of the general PLSAs. It is a parameter-independent way directly used to identify the dynamic relation between the actuating pressures and the principal degrees of freedom of a PLSA, the bending and the steering. The approach is based on a modified auxiliary kinematic setting. Following the discussion of the identification procedure, the implementations for the double chamber bending and steering are demonstrated. The results show that the proposed approach can accurately capture the nonlinear pressure-shape dynamics. The approach is also efficient in the real-time applications. It can be further used to improve the current control design for the PLSAs in robotic applications.",

In order to estimate the unknown parameters, the adaptation law is formulated based on the inverse dynamic model and the desired trajectories instead of the actual ones. To further improve the tracking performance and the disturbance rejection ability of the original controller, the static feedback gains are replaced by nonlinear varying ones. The computed control inputs are then projected using a kinematics based projector in order to remove the internal efforts in redundantly actuated parallel kinematic manipulators that may damage the mechanical structure of the manipulator. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the proposed controller is validated through real-time experiments on Dual-V; a 3-DOFs redundantly actuated parallel kinematic manipulator. The obtained results show that the proposed controller outperforms the original one in terms of tracking errors and energy consumption.",

The RISE feedback strategy yields semi-global asymptotic tracking despite the presence of unstructured additive disturbances provided some limited assumptions on the system. To achieve better tracking performance, the RISE controller is extended with a model-based adaptive feedforward term. The addition of the feedforward term compensates for the structured uncertainties yielding reduced tracking errors and reduced control effort. The proposed controller is experimentally implemented on a 3-DOFs redundantly actuated parallel manipulator.

We study the properties of the new approach as extender for RRT and RRT* and compare it systematically to a spline-based approach and a large and small set of motion primitives. The results show that our approach generally produces smoother paths to the goal in less time with smaller trees.

Its essential features lie in that its bending is not based on natural compliance of a continuous backbone element or soft skeletal elements but instead is based on the compliance of each structured planar module. This structure provides several important advantages. First, it demonstrates a large linear bending motion, whilst avoiding joint friction. Second, its contraction and bending motion are decoupled. Third, it possesses ideal back-drivability and a low hysteresis. We further provide an analytical method to study the compliance characteristics of the planar module and derive the statics and kinematics of the robot.

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) has been widely used in hospitals in the last few years due to its advantage of non-invasive and painless nature. However, this new technology produces about 55,000 images for each patient and poses a great burden on the professional clinicians to review these images, thus an automatic computer-aided diagnosis technique is in high demand. In this paper, we propose a new feature integrating the Gabor filter and Monogenic-Local Binary Pattern (M-LBP) methods in color components for polyp detection. The new feature not only can represent shape and edge information under multi-resolution, but also preserve color information. The proposed method is composed of the following steps: the first step is to transform the original WCE images into different color space and extract the corresponding Gabor responses of the color components. Next the M_LBP descriptors applied on the resulting Gabor responses are concatenated together to characterize the images. Finally we apply Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce feature dimensions and conduct experiments with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on a set of images containing 436 polyp images and 436 normal images. The experimental results achieved an encouraging polyp detection accuracy of 91.43%, showing that the new feature provides a good characterization and description of the WCE images for polyp classification tasks. To compare the performance of the proposed method, several traditional features have been considered and the proposed method has surpassed the alternative techniques significantly.",

        "abstract": "The authors have developed a non-invasive ultrasound theragnostic system (NIUTS) with a focal lesion servo (FLS) function based on stereo ultrasound imaging in order to compensate for movement while irradiating high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) onto a focal lesion. In the present paper, we propose a redundant motion control mechanism of the HIFU focus, for therapeutics, that is independent of the ultrasound probes for diagnostics. Using the proposed redundant motion control mechanism, an arbitrary designated position in the focal lesion can be treated without altering the viewpoint of the ultrasound probes. The proposed mechanism enables (i) noise factors, which deteriorate the image quality (IQ) for FLS, to be reduced, thereby enhancing the FLS performance, and (ii) enables the destruction of a focal lesion (kidney stone) with a preoperatively designated locus that is moving due to respiration/heartbeat.",

Thus one the key challenges in building effective robotic systems for such missions lies in developing good operator interfaces. In this paper, we present a novel asynchronous user-guided interface for human operators of robotic search of an unknown area. Enabled by efficient methods to store and retrieve recorded images (and meta information) in real-time, our interface allows the operator to click on any point of interest. The operator is then presented with highly-relevant images that cover the point, without occlusion. This, in contrast with system-guided approaches, where an automated system selects areas and images for inspection. Experiments with 32 human subjects in two different-size maps favor the user-guided approach we present over the system-guided approach. Additional experiments with human subjects provide an explanation as to the environment characteristics that favor our approach.",

Similar to the well-known Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum model for bipeds, we created a conceptual quadrupedal model with elastic massless legs. To obtain a well-defined sequence of ground contact, we defined three distinct phases for each leg: stance, swing, and wait for touch down. Since a leg cannot make contact during swing, modifying the duration of this phase allows us to prevent feet from striking the ground prematurely. Gaits were identified in a single shooting implementation, such that the contact sequence was only influenced by the starting values of the numerical integration. By varying these values, we were able to identify trotting, pacing, walking, toelting, bounding, and galloping within a single model. For each of the identified gaits, we report the footfall pattern, ground contact forces, speed, and first order limit cycle stability.",

We recreate and expand on a classic social psychology experiment by Solomon Asch, so as to explore three main dimensions. First, we wanted to know whether robots can prompt conformity in human subjects, and whether there is a significant difference between the degree to which individuals conform to a group of robots as opposed to a group of humans. Secondly we ask whether group pressure (from human or robot peers) can exert influence in verbal judgments, analogously to the influence on visual judgments that is known from previous research [3], [2]. Thirdly, we investigate whether the level of conformity differs between an ambiguous situation and a non-ambiguous situation. Our results show that in both visual and verbal tasks, participants exhibit conformity with human peers, but not with robot peers. The social influence of robot peers is not a significant predictor of verbal or visual judgments in our tasks. Furthermore, the level of conformity is significantly higher in an ambiguous (unclear) situation.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of grounding semantic representations in intelligent service robots. In particular, this work contributes to addressing two important aspects, namely the anchoring of object symbols into the perception of the objects and the grounding of object category symbols into the perception of known instances of the categories. The paper discusses memory requirements for storing both semantic and perceptual data and, based on the analysis of these requirements, proposes an approach based on two memory components, namely a semantic memory and a perceptual memory. The perception, memory, learning and interaction capabilities, and the perceptual memory, are the main focus of the paper. Three main design options address the key computational issues involved in processing and storing perception data: a lightweight, NoSQL database, is used to implement the perceptual memory; a thread-based approach with zero copy transport of messages is used in implementing the modules; and a multiplexing scheme, for the processing of the different objects in the scene, enables parallelization. The system is designed to acquire new object categories in an incremental and open-ended way based on user-mediated experiences. The system is fully integrated in a broader robot system comprising low-level control and reactivity to high-level reasoning and learning.",

Our application is formulated in a pursuer-evader framework in which an automated unmanned vehicle navigates its environment while avoiding a moving obstacle that acts as a malicious agent. Offline, we employ reachability analysis to characterize the evolution of trajectories so as to determine what control inputs can preserve safety over every sampling interval. The moving obstacle is considered unpredictable with nearly no restrictions on its control policies (although we do take into account the physical constraints due to limited dynamical and actuation capacities of both robots). Online, the controller executes computationally inexpensive operations based only on an easy-to-store lookup table. The results of the experiment as well as the proposed algorithm are presented and discussed in detail.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we improve the path-of-probability (POP) algorithm to generate better and smoother paths for robotic systems. The POP algorithm generates a full path with the maximum probability to reach a target. Although the POP algorithm has been successfully applied to path generation of robotic systems, it has the limit that the intermediate paths are generated using a finite and small number of candidate paths. This results in non-smooth (or zigzag pattern) paths which are not desirable for practical use. In addition, this approach sometimes fails to generate a path that reaches a target. This can be overcome by increasing the number of candidate paths, but it increases the computation time too. To improve the POP method, we use a fuzzy logic. The fuzzy logic enables us to obtain a continuous set for the intermediate paths from the discrete candidate paths. By applying it, smoother paths from the starting point to the target can be obtained directly without any additional path smoothing because the intermediate paths are chosen from a continuous set. Fundamentally, the fuzzy logic makes a mapping from a finite and discrete set of candidate paths to a continuous set of paths.

        "abstract": "We revisit a well-studied problem in the analysis of range data: surface normal estimation for a set of unorganized points. Surface normal estimation has been well-studied initially due to its theoretical appeal and more recently due to its many practical applications. The latter cover several aspects of range data analysis from plane or surface fitting to segmentation, object detection and scene analysis. Following the vast majority of the literature, we also focus our attention on techniques that operate in small neighborhoods around the point whose normal is to be estimated. We pay close attention to aspects of the implementation, such as the use of weights and normalization, that have not been studied in detail in the past. We perform quantitative evaluation on a diverse set of point clouds derived from 3D meshes, which allows us to obtain accurate ground truth.",

Since the lunar regolith environment in depth is unknown, sampling drill should be developed to adapt to the undetermined drilling medium on the moon. Once mechanical system of sampling robot was finished, control strategy is a key to realize the high-efficiency drilling process. Since composition of lunar regolith is complicated, it's not easy to evaluate all the physical parameters to judge the drilling difficulty level. This paper proposes a novel idea of lunar regolith drillability which is established on the rate of penetration under the given standard terms. Drillability is selected to describe the drilling difficulty level which can be identified online by use of pattern recognition method of SVM. Control algorithm tunes the drilling parameters to adapt to the recognized medium. Experiments are conducted to verify the drillability online recognition based intelligent control strategy can make sampling robot adapt to complicated drilling media.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a three-dimensional volumetric representation for safe navigation. It is based on the OctoMap representation framework that probabilistically fuses sensor measurements to represent the occupancy probability of volumes. To achieve safe navigation in a domestic environment this representation is extended with a model of the occupancy probability if no sensor measurements are received, and a proactive approach to deal with unpredictably moving obstacles that can arise from behind occlusions by always expecting obstacles to appear on the robot's path. By combining the occupancy probability of volumes with the position uncertainty of the robot, a probability of collision is obtained. It is shown that by relating this probability to a safe velocity limit a robot in a real domestic environment can move close to a certain maximum velocity but decides to attain a slower safe velocity limit when it must, analogous to velocity limits and warning signs in traffic.",

        "abstract": "A novel method to handle multiple robotic tasks with priorities is presented. The occurrence of singularities, both of the kinematic and algorithmic type, may affect the correct hierarchy in task execution. Existing methods deal with singularities either by using damped least squares solutions or by relaxing the enforcement of secondary tasks. Damped pseudo-inversion mitigates undesired effects near singularities, at the cost of non-negligible task errors and deformation even of the highest priority task. When secondary tasks are not enforced, hierarchy is preserved but these tasks are not executed accurately even when this would be possible. In our approach, joint motion contributions are added following the reverse order of task priorities and working with suitable projection operators. Higher priority tasks are processed at the end, avoiding possible deformations caused by singularities occurring in lower priority tasks. The proposed Reverse Priority (RP) method allows executing at best all tasks while still preserving the desired hierarchy. The effectiveness of the RP method is shown through numerical simulations and with experiments on a 7-dof KUKA LWR.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Smart powered wheelchairs offer the possibility of enhanced mobility to a large and growing population-most notably older adults-and a key feature of such a chair is collision avoidance. Sensors are required to detect nearby obstacles; however, complete sensor coverage of the immediate neighbourhood is challenging for reasons including financial, computational, aesthetic, user identity and sensor reliability. It is also desirable to predict the future motion of the wheelchair based on potential input signals; however, direct modeling and control of commercial wheelchairs is not possible because of proprietary internals and interfaces. In this paper we design a dynamic egocentric occupancy map which maintains information about local obstacles even when they are outside the field of view of the sensor system, and we construct a neural network model of the mapping between joystick inputs and wheelchair motion. Using this map and model infrastructure, we can evaluate a variety of risk assessment metrics for collaborative control of a smart wheelchair. One such metric is demonstrated on a wheelchair with a single RGB-D camera in two scenarios: a doorway traversal where the near edge of the doorframe is no longer visible to the camera as the chair makes its turn, and a longer navigation through a typical cluttered office environment.",

        "abstract": "Multi-robot manipulation allows for scalable environmental interaction, which is critical for multi-robot systems to have an impact on our world. A successful manipulation model requires cost-effective robots, robust hardware, and proper system feedback and control. This paper details key sensing and manipulator capabilities of the r-one robot. The r-one robot is an advanced, open source, low-cost platform for multi-robot manipulation and sensing that meets all of these requirements. The parts cost is around $250 per robot. The r-one has a rich sensor suite, including a flexible IR communication/localization/obstacle detection system, high-precision quadrature encoders, gyroscope, accelerometer, integrated bump sensor, and light sensors. Two years of working with these robots inspired the development of an external manipulator that gives the robots the ability to interact with their environment. This paper presents an overview of the r-one, the r-one manipulator, and basic manipulation experiments to illustrate the efficacy our design. The advanced design, low cost, and small size can support university research with large populations of robots and multi-robot curriculum in computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. We conclude with remarks on the future implementation of the manipulators and expected work to follow.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of modeling complex motions of pedestrians in a crowded environment. A number of methods have been proposed to predict the motion of a pedestrian or an object. However, it is still difficult to make a good prediction due to challenges, such as the complexity of pedestrian motions and outliers in a training set. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a robust autoregressive motion model based on Gaussian process regression using l1-norm based low-rank kernel matrix approximation, called PCGP-l1. The proposed method approximates a kernel matrix assuming that the kernel matrix can be well represented using a small number of dominating principal components, eliminating erroneous data. The proposed motion model is robust against outliers present in a training set and can reliably predict the motion of a pedestrian, such that it can be used by a robot for safe navigation in a crowded environment. The proposed method is applied to a number of regression and motion prediction problems to demonstrate its robustness and efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed method considerably improves the motion prediction rate compared to other Gaussian process regression methods.",

We create a Sample-Generated Pursuit-Evasion Graph (SG-PEG) that utilizes an abstract sample generator to search the pursuers' joint configuration space for a pursuer solution strategy that captures the evaders. We implemented our algorithm in simulation and provide results.",

To handle these problems, we design a micro-operational platform with multiple manipulators to facilitate a sequence of assembly. Six robot arms and three microscopes are incorporated, together with macro and micro motion systems. We also propose a hybrid control strategy to achieve high precision and protect objects. This hybrid scheme includes vision based positioning controllers for alignment, which employ incremental PI controllers and image Jacobian matrix, force based controllers for insertion, and a decision mechanism determining the assembly state. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed platform and control methods.",

An innovative transmission mechanism is designed based on the required trajectory and relative position for each arm link, enabling individual or simultaneous rotation of the two joints during the transition movement. An electromagnetic unit which adapts to both flat and curved structures is also designed and integrated in the arm. This solution was installed on the omnidirectional climbing robot, OmniClimber. The mechanism was successfully tested on a curved structure with a diameter of 220mm.",

One is degradation of orientation accuracy in frontal observation. The other is \u201cpose ambiguity\u201d that the orientation cannot be determined uniquely. We previously developed a novel visual marker \u201cLentiMark\u201d which solves the former problem. This time we propose a solution to the latter problem by improving it. We utilize two new moir\u00e9 patterns to get unique angle information and eliminate the pose ambiguity. The new marker enables stable and robust pose estimation without suffering from the pose ambiguities. The contribution of this study is that we solved the biggest two problems of visual markers, in the framework of small planar markers. We demonstrated the availability of our method through some comparative experiments.",

Therefore, we divide the whole configuration space into two sub-regions (i.e., a safe region and an obstacle avoidance region). We have derived two functions to define the robot's behavior in each region, which generate velocity vectors that drive the robot away from the obstacle and always towards the goal. We consider the existence of a switching surface between these two sub-regions, and specifically define this switching surface as a local subset of SE(2), i.e. the switching surface includes orientation, defined by the relative angle between the robot heading and bearing to the obstacle. Two different switching signals are proposed based on the switching surface. Lyapunov stability analysis proves the robot will converge to a goal position. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, several simulations and experiments have been conducted.",

Our system utilizes depth information available from an RGB-D Microsoft Kinect, rather than a stereo camera that is known to fail in poorly textured environments. The technique is based on a two-phase controller. The first phase provides a coarse image plane alignment with a target image using image saliencies for registration. The second phase relies on a depth-map-error-minimization to further reduce the position error and precisely situate the robot. Based on the magnitude of error between actual and desired position the system activates one or both phases sequentially to successfully servo the robot to its destination. Experiments demonstrate the success of the proposed system for both large and small initial position errors.",

        "abstract": "Flying in unknown environments can lead to unwanted collisions with the environment. If not being accounted for, these may cause serious damage to the robot and/or its environment. Fast and robust collision detection combined with safe reaction is therefore essential in this context. Deliberate physical interaction may also be required in some applications. The robot can then switch into an interaction mode when contact occurs. The control loop must also be designed with interaction in mind. To implement these mechanisms, knowledge of environmental interaction forces is required. In principle, they may be measured or estimated. In this paper, we present a novel model-based method for external wrench estimation in flying robots. The estimation is based on proprioceptive sensors and the robot's dynamics model only. Using this estimate, we also design admittance and impedance controllers for sensitive and robust physical interaction. We also investigate the performance of our collision detection and reaction schemes in order to guarantee collision safety. Upon collision, we determine the collision location and normal located on the robot's geometric model. The method relies on the complete wrench information provided by our scheme. This allows applications such as tactile environment mapping.",

        "abstract": "Minimally invasive surgery can involve navigating inside small cavities or reaching around sensitive tissues. Robotic instruments based on concentric tube technology are well suited to these tasks since they are slender and can be designed to take on shapes of high and varying curvature along their length. One limitation of these robots, however, is that elastic instabilities can arise when rotating one pre-curved tube inside another. While prior work has considered tubes of piecewise-constant pre-curvature, this paper proposes varying tube pre-curvature as a function of arc length as a means to enhance stability. Stability conditions for a planar tube pair are derived and used to define an optimal design problem. This framework enables solving for pre-curvature functions that achieve a desired tip orientation range while maximizing stability and respecting bending strain limits. Analytical and numerical examples of the approach are provided.",

        "abstract": "Direct teaching is suitable for generating motions of robot arms which have complex kinematics. So far, we have proposed a direct teaching method specialized for musculoskeletal robot arms actuated by pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) based on their pressure and tension information. In the method, it is important to prevent slacks and excessive tensions of PAMs to efficiently obtain the pressure and the tension information during the teaching phase. In this research, we propose a method for generating active behavior of musculoskeletal robots driven by PAMs to effectively receive human's direct teaching. The method, which is naturally derived from the simple analytical model of PAMs, requires only pressure and tension information of PAMs in musculoskeletal robot arms and does not need to cope with complex inverse kinematics problem. The validity of the method has been confirmed in the experiment using a minimalistic 2DOFs anthropomorphic musculoskeletal robot arm actuated by three pairs of agonist/antagonist PAMs.",

The representation is developed under a common probabilistic framework, particularly it uses a Gaussian Process to approximate the distribution of the friction coefficient over the surface, also represented as a Gaussian Process. The surface model is exploited to compute straight lines (geodesic flows) that guide the exploration. The exploration follows these flows by employing an impedance controller in pursuance of safety, shape accommodation and contact enforcement, while measuring the necessary data to estimate the friction coefficient. The exploratory probes consist of an RGBD camera and an Intrinsic Tactile sensor (ITs) mounted on a robotic arm. Experimental results give evidence for the effectiveness of the algorithm in the friction coefficient gathering and enrichment of the object representation.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to analyze the number of actuators as well as the actuation strategy for an underactuated prosthetic hands. Two comprehensive analysis were made for this purpose. 16 possible actuation strategies in five categories of one to five actuators were defined. Based on these 16 strategies two analysis were performed: grasp diversity and grasp functionality. For the first analysis we defined a performance metric based on all possible grasps by the human hand, while in the second analysis only the top grasps with the highest frequency of usage were considered. By comparing the performance of these strategies we obtained some interesting results regarding the best actuation strategies for the underactuated anthropomorphic hands.",

        "abstract": "Social spacing in human-robot interactions is among the main useful features when integrating human social intelligence into robot perception and action skills. One of the main challenges, is to capture the transitions incurred by the human and further take into account robot constraints. Towards this goal, we introduce a novel methodology that can instantiate diverse social spacing models depending on the context and further as a function of uncertainty and robot perception capacity. Our method is based on the use of non-stationary, skew-normal probability density functions for the space of individuals and on treating multi-person space interactions through social mapping. The utility of our approach is shown on an indoor robot operating in the presence of humans, allowing it to exhibit socially intelligent responses.",

        "abstract": "Wireless communication is an essential component of many unmanned systems, yet presently, there are some communication challenges that limit the full potential of these systems. In particular, transmission distance, throughput efficiency using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and wireless spectrum availability are a few of these challenges. In order to mitigate these specific problems, we propose an autonomous radio switching algorithm that allows unmanned systems to autonomously select the optimum radio between a set of diverse options, given the current conditions. More specifically, this study considers diversity between radios using the same common protocol but equipped with different antennas. A fuzzy logic controller is utilized to intelligently select whether to employ a directional or omnidirectional antenna based on the operating conditions at transmission time. Directional antennas offer many advantages, but are not ideal under all circumstances, and with the typical power constraints of unmanned systems, it is more costly in terms of current consumption to operate multiple radios simultaneously. Therefore, if only one radio is needed at a time, it is more energy efficient to implement smart radio switching. To autonomously facilitate this switching operation, we present a fuzzy controller called, \u201cAutonomous Radio Switching for Unmanned Systems (ARSUS)\u201d and show its effectiveness in improving TCP throughput and increasing transmission range.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Flexible interaction and instruction is a key enabling technology for expanding robotics into small to medium scale manufacturing, in-home assistance for physically disabled individuals, and robotic surgery. In these cases, performing a task manually is neither practical nor scalable, yet complete automation is cost-prohibitive or impossible. Thus, our interest is in collaborative systems that can be easily trained to work with an operator. This collaborative robotic system should be instructable in a generalizable way for a wide range of tasks, and should generalize to new tasks gracefully with minimal retraining. At the same time, for a given task, the system should take advantage of user interaction modalities needed to accomplish the task, subject to the constraints of the available interfaces. These ideas motivate the Adjutant framework. Adjutant supports human-robot collaborative operations for ranges of user roles and robot capability. Adjutant models human-robot systems via sets of robot capabilities, composable high-level functions that can be specialized to specific tasks, and collaborative behaviors which relate these capabilities to specific user interfaces or interaction paradigms. Adjutant also incorporates several methods encapsulating reusable task information into capabilites, thus specializing them, including tool affordances, perceptual grounding templates, and tool movement primitives. We have implemented Adjutant as a software framework in ROS and, in this paper, explore the utility of Adjutant for performing several real-world collaborative manufacturing tasks on an industrial robot test-bed.",

Using infrared emitters and combinations of wide and narrow angle detectors, this device combines proximity and force sensing to seamlessly transition from a pre-contact to contact state. As an inherently low-power device, it is amenable to mobile robotic applications. We also present results showing this engagement can occur very rapidly, making it useful in high-throughput manufacturing and dexterous manipulation tasks.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present both centralized and distributed algorithms for aligning coordinate frames in multi-robot systems based on inter-robot relative position measurements. Robot orientations are not measured, but are computed by our algorithms. Our algorithms are robust to measurement error and are useful in applications where a group of robots need to establish a common coordinate frame based on relative sensing information. The problem of establishing a common coordinate frame is formulated in a least squares error framework minimizing the total inconsistency of the measurements. We assume that robots that can sense each other can also communicate with each other. In this paper, our key contribution is a novel asynchronous distributed algorithm for multi-robot coordinate frame alignment that does not make any assumptions about the sensor noise model. After minimizing the least squares error (LSE) objective for coordinate frame alignment of two robots, we develop a novel algorithm that out-performs state-of-the-art centralized optimization algorithms for minimizing the LSE objective. Furthermore, we prove that for multi-robot systems (a) with redundant noiseless relative sensing information, we will achieve the globally optimal solution (this is non-trivial because the LSE objective is non-convex for our problem), (b) with noisy information but no redundant sensing (e.g. sensing graph has a tree topology), our algorithm will optimally minimize the LSE objective. We also present preliminary results of the real-world performance of our algorithm on TurtleBots equipped with Kinect sensors.",

        "abstract": "Bionic soft robots offer exciting perspectives for more flexible and safe physical interaction with the world and humans. Unfortunately, their hardware design often prevents analytical modeling, which in turn is a prerequisite to apply classical automatic control approaches. On the other hand, also modeling by means of learning is hardly feasible due to many degrees of freedom, high-dimensional state spaces and the softness properties like e.g. mechanical elasticity, which cause limited repeatability and complex dynamics. Nevertheless, the realization of basic control modes is important to leverage the potential of soft robots for applications. We therefore propose a hybrid approach combining classical and learning elements for the realization of an interactive control mode for an elastic bionic robot. It superimposes a low-gain feedback control with a feed-forward control based on a learned simplified model of the inverse dynamics which considers only equilibria of the robot's dynamics. We demonstrate on the Bionic Handling Assistant how a respective inverse equilibrium model can be learned and effectively exploited for quick and agile control. In a second step, the control scheme is extended to an active compliant control mode. It implements a kind of gravitation compensation to allow for kinesthetic teaching of the robot based on the implicit knowledge of gravitational and mechanical forces that are encoded in the learned equilibrium model. We finally discuss that this control scheme may be implemented also on other soft robots to provide the avenue towards their applications in general manipulation tasks.",

        "abstract": "A method to tune a basic input/output gain (BIOG) according to usage conditions for human-machine systems is proposed for improving work performance. Adapting a BIOG is effective in terms of improving operability and work efficiency, but frequent changes using a gain scheduling strategy degrade the operability by confusing the machine dynamics. The proposed tuning system adjusts a BIOG at long intervals on the basis of comprehensive features in operator and work content obtained from the histogram of control lever input. The target value is set to the normal distribution, meaning that all ranges of the control lever are evenly used in a spring-type lever, as leveling the histogram independent of an operator and work content provides the consistent operational feeling, which leads to comfortable operability. To ensure practicality and effectiveness, a BIOG curve is set to a polygonal line involving a break point and a saturation point that are tuned by equivalent transform of area differences between the obtained histogram and normal distribution curves. Two types of experimental task were performed using a hydraulic arm system. Results showed that the proposed BIOG tuning system improves time efficiency by reducing the area difference while increasing the subjective usability compared with a conventional fixed BIOG system.",

        "abstract": "Robotic technology has made significant progresses in the past years. Robots are now common in large manufacturing plants and other industrial settings, safely confined in closed work cells. But to be even more helpful, robots need the capability of interacting physically with humans, and with unstructured environments. This poses new challenges in the design of safe robotic systems. In this article we addressed this problem by proposing a novel design for the joints of the iCub robot. The new design provides the robot with an overload protection mechanism. The overload protection acts as a \u201cpassive\u201d torque saturator, which is intrinsically safe. We constructed a prototype of a robotic joint that implements this approach. We first show that our solution is effective in a typical impact scenario. We then evaluate the possible problems arising when the device is controlled with a position control loop. We show that a conventional feedback control loop can trigger positive feedback and instability. Operating the actuator in these conditions is dangerous and can lead to severe failures. We therefore propose the implementation of a relatively simple control strategy that allows to avoid this situation by monitoring slippage, without additional sensors. The quantitative evaluations in the paper demonstrate that our approach is effective and can improve the robustness and safety of complex robotic systems. Indeed these aspects are particularly critical in the case of humaniod robots that are systems prone to severe whole-body impacts in unstructured environments (e.g. falling).",

In order to face such problems, an accurate and fast model of the robot is necessary to estimate the state at a certain time in the future using only current measurements. We approximate the robot by a three-mass model with two degrees of freedom. Unilateral compliant contacts and a closed-loop control similar to the one used on the real robot are included additionally. Utilizing this model it is possible to predict the robot's behavior and calculate compensating motions for different disturbance cases. Furthermore, it is possible to integrate the estimation results into the real-time control system of our biped LOLA. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and the advantages of the proposed method.",

In order to execute agile behaviors such as jumping, rapid actuation modes are required. Here we present an untethered soft-bodied robot that uses a combination of pneumatic and explosive actuators to execute directional jumping maneuvers. This robot can autonomously jump up to 0.6 meters laterally with an apex of up to 0.6 meters (7.5 times it's body height) and can achieve targeted jumping onto an object. The robot is able to execute these directed jumps while carrying the required fuel, pneumatics, control electronics, and battery. We also present a thermodynamic model for the combustion of butane used to power jumping, and calculate the theoretical maximum work output for the design. From experimental results, we find the mechanical efficiency of this prototype to be 0.8%.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The goal of this study was to develop a transfemoral prosthesis that realizes a natural and smooth gait. To realize such prostheses, the smoothness or goodness of walking in the swing phase should be investigated. So far, many studies have investigated the human gait. However, the goodness of walking has not been clearly defined. Passive walking has drawn much attention because it includes the essence of the gait with higyly energy-efficient walking. The human gait is thought to effectively utilize the dynamics of the body for a smooth gait. Investigating the human gait should help in building smoothly walking robots and realizing prostheses that make it easy to walk. The present paper proposes a method to evaluate the inertial motion of the human gait in the swing phase and a method to generate the joint motion profile of a transfemoral prosthesis that utilizes its inertial motion. First, an inertial motion index is proposed to evaluate the closeness of the given motion to the inertial motion of multilink systems. The gait of healthy participants in the swing phase was analyzed using the proposed index. The results showed that inertial motion is effectively used in the middle of the swing phase. Based on the results, a motion generation method is proposed for the knee joint of a prosthesis that utilizes the inertial motion in the middle of the swing phase. Simulation results with the method showed that a smoother change in torque was realized compared to another method that uses the measured joint motion of human gait as the desired trajectory for the PD controller.",

The SLIP model is, however, sensitive to impact angle for various terrain heights. One known method for increasing the model's robustness to terrain changes is the Swing Leg Retraction (SLR) method. Despite its popularity, an analytic formulation of this method has yet been provided. In this work, using an instantaneous stance phase assumption, we present the increase in robustness of the swing method. This analysis provides a way to isolate the optimal parameters of the SLR. We validate these optimal parameters in simulations and proof-of-concept experiments in a planar environment.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Designing robot hands for dexterous precision manipulation involves many complex tradeoffs in order to optimize hand performance. While many studies focus on overall hand kinematics, far fewer consider tradeoffs in the design of the robotic finger surfaces themselves. Our present work uses 3.8 total hours of precision manipulation from 19 participants to look at the fingertip surfaces used while moving a sphere through as much of the feasible position workspace as possible. Fingertip surface use is estimated by measuring the relative orientation changes between a high-resolution 6DOF sensor mounted on the fingernails of the fingers and in the object being manipulated, indicating to what extent the object has been \u201crolled\u201d onto the sides of the fingers. The results show significant lateral use of the index and middle fingers, and also show that the side surface of the index finger is used much more in two-finger manipulation than three finger manipulation. The lateral fingertip usage suggests that robot finger designs could also benefit from enabling lateral surface use. The lateral middle finger use also suggests that fingers can be effectively used as passive supports to supply forces in directions that may not be actively controlled. We anticipate these results should be useful especially for robotic and prosthetic hand design, but also in other fields such as rehabilitation or haptic interface design.",

        "abstract": "In multi-robot systems, efficiently navigating in a a partially-known environment is an ubiquitous but challenging task, as each robot must account for the uncertainty introduced, for example, by other moving robots. This uncertainty makes pre-computed plans not always applicable, and often hinders the desired efficient use of the robot's resources. In this work, we present a local anytime approach for robot motion planning that accounts for the uncertainty of the environment by generating \u2018snapshots\u2019 of possible future scenarios. Our approach adapts the Hindsight optimization technique to allow robots to plan their immediate motion based on long-term efficiency. We validate our approach by comparing the efficiency on the paths executed against a state-of-the art navigation technique in a variety of scenarios, and show that by accounting for the uncertainty in the environment, agents can improve their time- and energy-efficient motions.",

        "abstract": "The ability of robotic systems to effectively address disaster scenarios that are potentially dangerous for human operators is continuing to grow as a research and development field. This leverages research from areas such as bimanual manipulation, dexterous grasping, bipedal locomotion, computer vision, sensing, object segmentation, varying degrees of autonomy, and operator control/feedback. This paper describes the development of a semi-autonomous bimanual dexterous robotic system that comes to the aid of a mannequin simulating an injured victim by operating a fire extinguisher, affixing a cervical collar, cooperatively placing the victim on a spineboard with another bimanual robot, and relocating the victim. This system accomplishes these tasks through a series of control modalities that range from supervised autonomy to full teleoperation and allows the control model to be chosen and optimized for a specific subtask. We present a description of the hardware platform, the software control architecture, a human-in-the-loop computer vision algorithm, and an infrastructure to use a variety of user input devices in combination with autonomous control to compete several dexterous tasks. The effectiveness of the system was demonstrated in both laboratory and live outdoor demonstrations.",

It takes an all-in-one design: all of the actuators (total five DC motors) are embedded into a palm, while finger parts do not have any electronic devices for attaining to be inherently safe as an end-effector. The mechanism allows us adaptive synergic motions of three joints of a finger (MP, PIP and DIP) according to configuration of gripping objects. The hand also has a mechanism for adjusting stiffness of fingers, which allows to give passive gripping force to a gripping object according to the object's elasticity. Driving tests show that it achieves typical gripping and pinching motions of a human hand in daily life without any sensory feedback and also show that the stiffness adjuster works effectively.",

Various materials and processes have been proposed but their real life applications especially in wet/air environments are still very few mainly due to their mechanical robustness and non-linearity. Polymer microhelical devices are promising to overcome such mechanical limitations. Three-dimensional laser lithography allows fabrications of polymer helical microdevices with different geometries and designs but their mechanical properties were not yet known. In this paper, we present the fabrication of polymer microhelical device and in-situ scanning electron microscope micromanipulations for their mechanical property characterizations. It reachs mean stiffness up to 0.82 N/m (91.3 times higher than self-scrolling semiconductor microhelical devices which is 0.009 N/m), 68 % of elongation range and 12 \u03bcN of application force. The linearity of their mechanics can also reach up to 39 % of their elongation. Thanks to their excellent large range force/displacement mechanics and linearity, polymer micro-helical devices can further be applied as force sensors for measuring mechanical properties of deformable biological objects or soft nanostructures.",

We use the case study of a vehicle cruise-control, however, the strategy we present in this work is general for several applications. Our methodology relays on redundancy in the sensor measurements: specifically we consider N velocity measurements and use a recursive filtering technique that estimates the state of the system while being resilient against sensor attacks by acting on the variance of the measurements noise. Finally, we move our focus on hardware validation demonstrating our algorithm through extensive outdoor experiments conducted on two unmanned ground robots.",

First in a mapping stage, a 3D description of the environment that contains information about acoustic reflection is created. Then during operation, the robot combines estimated directions of arrival of sound with this 3D description to detect entities that are not visible by line of sight sensors but could be heard because of sound reflections. Using this approach, it is possible to restrict the hypothesis about the position of a sound emitting entity in the blind region to a small set of candidate depth values.",

        "abstract": "Humans are able to merge information from multiple perceptional modalities and formulate a coherent representation of the world. Our thesis is that robots need to do the same in order to operate robustly and autonomously in an unstructured environment. It has also been shown in several fields that multiple sources of information can complement each other, overcoming the limitations of a single perceptual modality. Hence, in this paper we introduce a data set of actions that includes both visual data (RGB-D video and 6DOF object pose estimation) and acoustic data. We also propose a method for recognizing and segmenting actions from continuous audio-visual data. The proposed method is employed for extensive evaluation of the descriptive power of the two modalities, and we discuss how they can be used jointly to infer a coherent interpretation of the recorded action.",

        "abstract": "Bayesian filtering often relies on a reduced system state relating to robot internal variables only. The exogenous variables and their effects on the measurement process are then encompassed within a global observation noise model. Even if Bayes filters proved to be robust to such approximations, special care has to be taken to handle some of these exogenous effects, usually by introducing complex observation distributions or rejection rules. No matter how complex these models are, they often fail in dealing with contextual incidence which can hardly be explicitly encoded. This article shows how contextual information can be introduced within the Bayesian filtering framework by coupling a filter with classification and regression probabilistic models. The classification model provides an efficient context-dependent measurement selection mechanism and is specifically trained with respect to the filter estimation performance. This first component is enhanced by the introduction of context-dependent observation noise provided by the regression model. The performance of this is approach is evaluated and compared with other methods in the context of altitude estimation for a UAV.",

In outdoor environments, scene dynamic range may be wider than the dynamic range of the cameras due to sunlight and skylight. This can results in failures of vision-based algorithms because important image features are missing due to under-/over-saturation. To solve the problem, we adjust camera exposure to maximize image features in the gradient domain. By exploiting the gradient domain, our method naturally determines the proper exposure needed to capture important image features in a manner that is robust against illumination conditions. The proposed method is implemented using an off-the-shelf machine vision camera and is evaluated using outdoor robotics applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which improves the performance of robot vision algorithms.",

In our framework, the desired behavior of a group of robots is specified using a set of safe linear temporal logic (LTL) properties. Our method relies on a library of motion primitives, each of which corresponds to a controller that ensures a particular trajectory in a given configuration. Using the closed-loop behavior of the robots under the action of different controllers, we formulate the motion planning problem as an SMT solving problem and use an off-the-shelf SMT solver to generate trajectories for the robots. Our approach can also be extended to synthesize optimal cost trajectories where optimality is defined with respect to the available motion primitives. Experimental results show that our framework can efficiently solve complex motion planning problems in the context of multi-robot systems.",

Therefore, in this study, we propose an assembly strategy for complex-shaped parts which performs force control based on visually-obtained geometric information and CAD models. CAD models are used to obtain geometric information about the parts, and a camera is used to track their position and orientation. In addition, an impedance control scheme is used to control the contact force to avoid excessive force during assembly tasks. The performance of the proposed guidance algorithm was evaluated by a series of experiments using arbitrary complex-shaped parts.",

Robot automation can help transfer some of this control burden from the user to the machine. This work presents an algorithm for the automated detection of safe docking locations at rectangular and circular docking structures (tables, desks) with proper alignment information using 3D point cloud data. The safe docking locations can then be provided as goals to an autonomous path planner, within the context of providing adaptive driving assistance for powered wheelchair users.

Applications involving the segmentation and tracking of persons, vehicles, and other heat-emitting objects, for example, could benefit tremendously from even coarsely accurate relative temperatures. With the increasing affordability of commercially available thermal cameras, as well as the imminent introduction of new, mobile form factors, such data will be readily and widely accessible. However, in order for thermal processing to complement existing methods in RGBD, there must be an effective procedure for calibrating RGBD and thermal cameras to create RGBDT (red, green, blue, depth, and thermal) data. In this paper, we present an automatic method for the synchronization and calibration of RGBD and thermal cameras in arbitrary environments. While traditional calibration methods fail in our multimodal setting, we leverage invariant features visible by both camera types. We first synchronize the streams with a simple optimization procedure that aligns their motion statistic time series. We then find the relative poses of the cameras by minimizing an objective that measures the alignment between edge maps from the two streams. In contrast to existing methods that use special calibration targets with key points visible to both cameras, our method requires nothing more than some edges visible to both cameras, such as those arising from humans. We evaluate our method and demonstrate that it consistently converges to the correct transform and that it results in high-quality RGBDT data.",

This technology is envisaged to be a central component for brain-controlled computers and robots.

Therefore, we address the problem of autonomously choosing, for a given number, the subset of electrodes with the corresponding size so as to extract as much information as possible. We first present an approach for predicting neural spikes across different channels of the probe. Our method employs nonparametric sparse Gaussian process regression to predict the signal of a channel given the signals recorded at neighboring sites. Second, we utilize the signal predictions for efficiently seeking for the subset of electrodes that minimizes the overall prediction error. In experiments carried out using real neural data, we demonstrate that our selection procedure provides highly accurate results. Furthermore, the solutions found in our experiments are close to the optimal solution.",

        "abstract": "Assessment of the condition of underground pipelines is crucial to avoid breakages. Autonomous in-line inspection tools provided with Non-destructive Technology (NDT) sensors to assess large sections of the pipeline are commonly used for these purposes. An example of such sensors based on Eddy currents is the Remote Field Technology (RFT). A crucial step during in-line inspections is the detection of construction features, such as joints and elbows, to accurately locate and size specific defects within pipe sections. This step is often performed manually with the aid of visual data, which results in slow data processing. In this paper, we propose a generic framework to automate the detection and verification of these construction features using both NDT sensor data and visual images. Firstly, supervised learning is used to identify the construction features in the NDT sensor signals. Then, image processing is employed to verify the selection. Results are presented with data from a RFT tool, for which a specialised descriptor has been designed to characterise and classify its signal features. Furthermore, the construction feature is displayed in the image, once it is identified in the RFT data and detected in the visual data. A visual odometry algorithm has been implemented to locate the visual data with respect to the RFT data. About 800 meters of these multi-modal data are evaluated to test the validity of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "This work aims at automatic detection of man-made pole-like structures in scans of urban environments acquired by a 3D sensor mounted on top a moving vehicle. Pole-like structures, such as e.g. roadsigns and streetlights, are widespread in these environments, and their reliable detection is relevant to applications dealing with autonomous navigation, facility damage detection, city planning and maintenance. Yet, due to the characteristic thin shape, detection of man-made pole-like structures is significantly prone to both noise as well as occlusions and clutter, the latter being pervasive nuisances when scanning urban environments. Our approach is based on a \u201clocal\u201d stage, whereby local features are classified and clustered together, followed by a \u201cglobal\u201d stage aimed at further classification of candidate entities. The proposed pipeline turns out effective in experiments on a standard publicly available dataset as well as on a challenging dataset acquired during the project for validation purposes.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Automatically segmenting and recognizing human activities from observations typically requires a very complex and sophisticated perception algorithm. Such systems would be unlikely implemented on-line into a physical system, such as a robot, due to the pre-processing step(s) that those vision systems usually demand. In this work, we present and demonstrate that with an appropriate semantic representation of the activity, and without such complex perception systems, it is sufficient to infer human activities from videos. First, we will present a method to extract the semantic rules based on three simple hand motions, i.e. move, not move and tool use. Additionally, the information of the object properties either ObjectActedOn or ObjectInHand are used. Such properties encapsulate the information of the current context. The above data is used to train a decision tree to obtain the semantic rules employed by a reasoning engine. This means, we extract lower-level information from videos and we reason about the intended human behaviors (high-level). The advantage of the abstract representation is that it allows to obtain more generic models out of human behaviors, even when the information is obtained from different scenarios. The results show that our system correctly segments and recognizes human behaviors with an accuracy of 85%. Another important aspect of our system is its scalability and adaptability toward new activities, which can be learned on-demand. Our system has been fully implemented on a humanoid robot, the iCub to experimentally validate the performance and the robustness of our system during on-line execution of the robot.",

In combination with recent single-view object recognition techniques, the supplementary information provided by multiple vantage points results in a rich and integrated representation of the environment, in the form of a 3D reconstructed scene as well as object hypotheses therein. We argue that such a representation facilitates improved recognition to an extent that the recovered results, obtained by means of a suitable 3D hypotheses verification stage, closely resemble the ground truth of the scene under consideration. On two large datasets, totalling more than 3500 object instances, our method yields 99.1% and 93.2% correct automatic annotations. These results corroborate our approach for the task at hand.",

        "abstract": "A global localization method for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) based on background flow velocity map prediction is proposed. Background flow velocity maps with time stamps are assumed to be predicted by a regional ocean model with certain accuracy and these maps are preloaded onto vehicles. Vehicles measure (estimate) general absolute flow velocities at their locations through local sensing. Particle filters are implemented to estimate AUVs' locations by comparing local flow velocity measurements with flow velocity prediction. The proposed algorithm is path independent and is suitable for any non-uniform vector fields. Convergence of localization error is achieved in simulation tests in a time dependent benchmark flow field, namely the double-gyre flow field. A two-dimensional vector field interpolation scheme based on irregularly-spaced data points is implemented to estimate theoretical flow velocities at vehicles' locations. It is shown that interpolation error can be treated as low-level map noise, which has limited impact on convergence. Localization error converges in simulation tests with different levels of map noise, which we believe to be dominant in practice comparing to measurement noise and vehicle control noise.",

Contrary to most previous Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC) solutions for planetary landing, which have involved a sensor suite including an IMU, an innovative strategy is presented here for estimating states without any need for inertial measurements, based solely on information about the relative velocity of the images of the surrounding environment. A Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) observer designed on a LPV system linearized around a reference trajectory, estimates: the ventral OF, the expansion OF and the local pitch angle. A previously developed observer was applied here to a larger class of nonlinear systems by making an ingenious change of variable. Simulations performed on a lunar landing scenario yielded satisfactory performance and showed the robustness of the OF based observer to initial uncertainties and measurement noise.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an angular momentum based controller to control the balancing motion of a spatial underactuated robot with three degrees of under-actuation. The control algorithm is based on the idea of decoupling the robot's motion instantaneously into bending and swivelling motions. This property of the robot is obtained by using a constant velocity joint as the 2-DoF active joint of the robot. Simulation results show the performance of the controller during some interesting motions of the robot such as straightening, crouching and reorienting motions. The last two motions, which are the results of decoupling the robot's motion, are demonstrated here for the first time.",

        "abstract": "Recently several hierarchical inverse dynamics controllers based on cascades of quadratic programs have been proposed for application on torque controlled robots. They have important theoretical benefits but have never been implemented on a torque controlled robot where model inaccuracies and real-time computation requirements can be problematic. In this contribution we present an experimental evaluation of these algorithms in the context of balance control for a humanoid robot. The presented experiments demonstrate the applicability of the approach under real robot conditions (i.e. model uncertainty, estimation errors, etc). We propose a simplification of the optimization problem that allows us to decrease computation time enough to implement it in a fast torque control loop. We implement a momentum-based balance controller which shows robust performance in face of unknown disturbances, even when the robot is standing on only one foot. In a second experiment, a tracking task is evaluated to demonstrate the performance of the controller with more complicated hierarchies. Our results show that hierarchical inverse dynamics controllers can be used for feedback control of humanoid robots and that momentum-based balance control can be efficiently implemented on a real robot.",

The algorithm is based on choosing control actions that minimise the value of a potential field cost function calculated directly from the image plane. The algorithm is suitable for teach and replay or leader follower implementations where the desired path is represented as a collection of images. The algorithm computes the cost function based on the relative bearings of features matched between the current and previously observed images. A forward prediction step is then used to determine the control action that will lead to the greatest reduction in the cost function. The algorithm is demonstrated on a 400 m path in an outdoor environment where the accuracy is shown to be similar to that of differential GPS.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper describes the applicability of an asymmetric force feedback control framework for bimanual robot-assisted surgery using the da Vinci surgical system (Intuitive Surgical Inc.). The core idea of this method, previously presented in [1], is that when completing two-handed tasks involving an action and a reaction force, the forces applied on the environment by the action hand are not transferred back to the same hand, but rather to the reaction hand. Such a method provides an intuitive way of feeling the force, while avoiding the instability issues, since the control loop in not closed from the slave to the master of the same hand. In the introductory paper [1], the technique was implemented using game controllers with simple tasks. In this paper, the technique was implemented on the da Vinci surgical system (Classic version) using the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) controllers that enable complete access to all control levels of the da Vinci robot manipulators via custom mechatronics and open-source software. The implementation involved a full re-write of a teleoperation controller based on kinematic correspondence with gravity compensation, as well as torque control functions for force rendering on the da Vinci master manipulators. A series of suture knot tying and haptic exploration experiments were conducted in which a small group of users, both surgeons (N=3) and novices (N=6) evaluated the system. The results show that the proposed technique has some promise when implemented in a realistic 14 degrees of freedom system, but further work is necessary to make the system fully usable.",

Current state of the art probabilistic Wi-Fi SLAM algorithms are limited by spatial resolution and an inability to remove the accumulation of rotational error, inherent limitations of the Wi-Fi architecture. In this paper we leverage the low quality sensory requirements and coarse metric properties of RatSLAM to localize using Wi-Fi fingerprints. To further improve performance, we present a novel sensor fusion technique that integrates camera and Wi-Fi to improve localization specificity, and use compass sensor data to remove orientation drift. We evaluate the algorithms in diverse real world indoor and outdoor environments, including an office floor, university campus and a visually aliased circular building loop. The algorithms produce topologically correct maps that are superior to those produced using only a single sensor modality.",

Our robot uses a 3D LIDAR and a camera to classify terrain as either asphalt, cobblestones, grass, or gravel. We build on previous work where we modeled the terrain as a Conditional random field to account for spatial dependencies, which improved results substantially. We now show how to speed up the spatial classification by defining a new energy term for neighborhood relations. Moreover, we now also consider temporal dependencies as the robot moves. This not only further improves the results, but makes it possible to build local terrain maps of the environment. We describe how to efficiently integrate the classification results of each time step into the map in a probabilistic manner. By also detecting obstacles with the LIDAR, the robot can build combined terrain and elevation maps. We show that these maps can be used for semantic robot localization.",

The paper also presents a demonstrated solution to this in the form of the CHARM (Coin Handling Arm for Robotics Mastery) robot, which addresses the autonomous coin sorting problem using an economical kit made from commodity computing hardware and three Dynamixel servomotors. From a learning perspective, this problem facilitates interdisciplinary practice across subject and grade levels with an algorithmic foundation that is central to modern robotics. Evidence supporting this approach is illustrated from case studies of student projects and, in particular, the CHARM robot. Beyond practice alone, by presenting a challenging (but manageable) research problem, we found that the coin sorting task teaches robotics in a principled way. Further, algorithmic complexity tiers the problem to academic levels. While motivated by robotics education, the (optimal) coin sorting problem may also be seen as an archetype problem for manipulation/motion-planning research. Thus, this also promotes a research foundation supporting later research opportunities.",

Control algorithms that are currently used for RLMs cannot be directly applied to FLMs. Majority of research on FLMs has focused on how to eliminate or reduce the undesirable effects of flexibility by specially developed control algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a new design change that stiffens the flexible link manipulator using cables and minimizes the effect of flexibility while retaining the advantages of FLMs. Such cable stiffened flexible link manipulators have the advantage of allowing the use of existing control techniques designed for RLMs. Effectiveness of this new approach is shown through simulations and experiments.",

Due to constraints during design, robots may not be equipped with the required sensors to intrinsically recover the kinematic state up to the required precision. To recover the unknown state using a pair of inertial sensors their relative pose to the opposite ends must be known. We propose an approach to calibrate these unknown relationships in a straightforward and methodically sound way while considering any existing inaccuracies in the kinematic chain. To obtain the desired parameters the calibration problem is formulated as a least squares batch-optimization problem. The proposed approach is integrated on DLR's humanoid robot Agile Justin to determine the pair of inertial sensors mounted at the opposite ends of the torso/head chain and further experimentally validated.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a camera control approach for learning unknown nonlinear target dynamics by approximating information value functions using particles that represent targets' position distributions. The target dynamics are described by a non-parametric mixture model that can learn a potentially infinite number of motion patterns. Assuming that each motion pattern can be represented as a velocity field, the target behaviors can be described by a non-parametric Dirichlet process-Gaussian process (DP-GP) mixture model. The DP-GP model has been successfully applied for clustering time-invariant spatial phenomena due to its flexibility to adapt to data complexity without overfitting. A new DP-GP information value function is presented that can be used by the sensor to explore and improve the DP-GP mixture model. The optimal camera control is computed to maximize this information value function online via a computationally efficient particle-based search method. The proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations and hardware experiments in the RAVEN testbed at MIT.",

The trajectory is relative to the actor, so that the robot has to take into account the actor's movement. We map the given trajectory to a new one in the state-time space based on the prediction of the actor's pose. We then build a trajectory tracking system using a 3D time-space wavefront potential considering the robot kinematic, trajectory cost, obstacles, and visibility constraints. This potential is then used for generating the robot motion control by using a modified random tree search algorithm with the control law. Simulation results show the effectiveness and feasibility of our approach.",

The method combines the synchronous control and the impedance control together which can not only be used in the position control but can also realize the purpose of force control of the system with multi-manipulators. Therefore, if there are multi-manipulators grasping the same object, it can ensure the object will not fall and not be destroyed. The mathematical validation process and the stability proof of the method have been given. Besides, an experiment setup which has two 7-DOF robot arms has been established to testify the method. The testing result shows that the dual arm system, under disturbance, can ensure stable grasping of the object with the CSSIC method.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of controlling a robot arm executing a cooperative task with a human who guides the robot through direct physical interaction. This problem is tackled by allowing the end effector to comply according to an impedance control law defined in the Cartesian space. While, in principle, the robot's dynamics can be fully compensated and any impedance behaviour can be imposed by the control, the stability of the coupled human-robot system is not guaranteed for any value of the impedance parameters. Moreover, if the robot is kinematically or functionally redundant, the redundant degrees of freedom play an important role. The idea proposed here is to use redundancy to ensure a decoupled apparent inertia at the end effector. Through an extensive experimental study on a 7-DOF KUKA LWR4 arm, we show that inertial decoupling enables a more flexible choice of the impedance parameters and improves the performance during manual guidance.",

The disturbance torques at each joint, generated by external forces at the end-effector of robot, are estimated using a disturbance observer, then they are converted to the force/moment in Cartesian space with the robot Jacobian. The force control algorithm is realized through a powerful position servo of industrial robot controller. Furthermore, the friction's harmful effect on the sensor-less force control is reduced using a high frequency dither signal. The validity of the proposed control algorithm is investigated through the experiments with industrial robots. Real application tests are conducted like a peg-in-hole assembly and a die casting application and contact stability with a stiff environment is also checked by a push task with various push levels.",

We utilized the technique of convective self-assembly, which is a technique for depositing uniform onto the microfluidic device, to array single CTCs. Under the suspended cancer cells experiments, we demonstrated that by using this system, the collection efficiency of cells which could be deposited on the microfluidic device was 98.3% while the flow rate was 57.1 \u00b5l/min. This system will be conducive to single rare cells analysis because the deposited cells could be picked up by glass pipette easily.",

        "abstract": "Successful and robust grasping for humanoid robots is still an ongoing research topic in robotics. Applying human-inspired grasping strategies does not only correspond with more natural looking motions but can also yield good results regarding task success when having to deal with uncertainty. This study investigates human high-level grasping strategies and how they tend to change for different objects when the uncertainty of object location or orientation increases in between two grasps. We are especially interested in potential gains for humanoid robots in a common household setting. By analyzing collected data from human subject grasp experiments with a set of typical objects found in people's homes, we get better insight into how humans handle uncertainty, as well as when and how they change their applied pre-grasp strategy. By adapting the by far most often observed change from a direct grasp attempt to a tapping strategy when dealing with high uncertainty, we can demonstrate a substantial increase of grasp success rate for our robot system with a Shadow Dexterous Hand mounted on a Motoman SDA10 robot while using less than two hand correction steps on average.",

This paper presents a method to characterize the precision manipulation capabilities of a given robot hand regardless of the particularities of the grasped object. The technique allows determining the composition of the displacement manifold (finite motion) of the grasped object relative to the palm of the robot hand and defining the displacements that can actually be controlled by the hand actuators without depending on external factors to the hand. The approach is based on a reduction of the graph of kinematic constraints related to the hand-object system through proper manipulations of the continuous subgroups of displacements generated by the hand joints and contacts. The proposed method is demonstrated through three detailed and constructive examples of common architectures of simplified multi-fingered hands.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of steering a nonholonomic mobile robot to achieve a circular motion around a target. We propose control schemes that require only bearing measurements and deal with two types of targets: point target and disk target. Circumnavigation schemes are developed to achieve efficient encirclement of the target. We show that using the proposed control schemes, the robot can circle the target from a prescribed radius without distance measurement and avoid collision with disk target as well. The validity of the proposed control schemes is supported by experiments on an e-puck robot.",

        "abstract": "We present a motion planning approach for performing a learned task while avoiding obstacles and reacting to the movement of task-relevant objects. We employ a closed-loop sampling-based motion planner that acquires new sensor information, generates new collision-free plans that are based on a learned task model, and replans at an average rate of more than 10 times per second for a 7-DOF manipulator. The task model is learned from expert demonstrations prior to task execution and is represented as a hidden Markov model. During task execution, our motion planner quickly searches in the Cartesian product of the task model and a probabilistic roadmap for a plan with features most similar to the demonstrations given the locations of the task-relevant objects. We improve the replan rate by using a fast bidirectional search and by biasing the sampling distribution using information from the learned task model to construct high-quality roadmaps. We illustrate the efficacy of our approach by performing a simulated navigation task with a 2D point robot and a physical powder transfer task with the Baxter robot.",

By a proper adoption of slack variables and using the task priority concept, the proposed method allows for the accommodation of inequality constraints in a closed-form inverse kinematics solution for robotic manipulators. Unlike other formulations, the proposed scheme does not require solving a sequence of constrained optimization problems in real time and in this sense is faster. The performance of the proposed scheme is investigated through an implementation for real-time control of a concentric-tube robot with a restricted operational space. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the scheme in handling inequality constraints in real-time closed-loop inverse kinematics.",

The system then generates complete mechanical drawings suitable for fabrication, instructions for the assembly of electronics, and software to control and drive the final robot. Several robots designed in this manner demonstrate the ability and versatility of this process.",

        "abstract": "We consider cognitive factories with multiple teams of heterogenous robots, and address two key challenges of these domains, hybrid reasoning for each team and finding an optimal global plan (with minimum makespan) for multiple teams. For hybrid reasoning, we propose (i) modeling each team's workspace taking into account capabilities of heterogeneous robots, (ii) embedding continuous external computations into discrete symbolic representation and reasoning by combining different methods of integration, (iii) not only optimizing the makespans of local plans but also minimizing the total cost of robotic actions, where costs of actions can be defined in various ways. To find a global plan with minimum makespan, we propose a semi-distributed approach: we formulate the problem of finding an optimal coordination of teams that can help each other, prove its intractability, and describe how to solve this problem using existing automated reasoners. As a case study, we show applications of our hybrid reasoning and coordination approaches on a cognitive toy factory with dynamic simulations and physical implementation utilizing KuKa youBots and Lego NXT robots (supplementary video provided). We also present experimental results to discuss the scalability of these methods.",

Existing methods usually exploit complex behavior models or use dynamic constraints in collision prediction. However, these methods all assume simple geometries, such as disc, which significantly limit their applicability. This paper proposes a new approach that advances collision prediction beyond disc robots and handles arbitrary polygons. Our new tool predicts collision by assuming that obstacles are adversarial. Comparing to an online motion planner that replans periodically at fixed time interval and planner that approximates obstacle with discs, our experimental results provide strong evidences that the new method significantly reduces the number of replans while maintaining higher success rate of finding a valid path. Our geometric-based collision prediction method provides a tool to handle highly complex shapes and provides a complimentary approach to those methods that consider behavior and dynamic constraints of objects with simple shapes.",

        "abstract": "The spatial configuration of actuated flexible instruments is fundamental for control applications in robotic noscar surgery. In these operations, the instruments are inserted in the channels of a flexible guide equipped with an endoscopic camera. In this paper we propose to estimate the position of the instruments of the Anubis platform (Karl Storz) using the endoscopic images provided by the embedded camera. In this system flexible instruments have 3-DOF (translation and rotation in the channel and deflection). Application of standard approaches for 3D location with such system do not provide good accuracy because of uncertainties on several model parameters. To cope with these uncertainties, supervised learning methods has been explored. With the help of colored visual markers attached to the instruments, the proposed approach consists of an image segmentation stage followed by a position estimation stage. Firstly, the markers are segmented in the images using an AdaBoost classifier manually trained on in-vivo images. Subsequently, the resulting blobs are used as input data of an approximation function trained using ground truth information provided by a magnetic sensor.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a complexity-based motion feature learning method and hierarchical spatio-temporal na\u00efve Bayes classifier for human action recognition. As a motion feature learning method, we developed a complexity-based subsequence of time series clustering (C-STSC) method to learn time series codewords from a human motion trajectory. The key to the C-STSC method is to measure the importance of each subsequence in time series data through to use of a complexity measure. Next, time series codewords are learned on the basis of the important subsequences by using a clustering algorithm. Moreover, we also propose a hierarchical spatio-temporal na\u00efve Bayes classifier (HST-NBC) to classify the C-STSC features, where both the codeword-type and its spatio-temporal information is explicitly represented as a composite node in a Bayesian network framework. To validate the proposed method, we present experimental results of the proposed approach with respect to several open datasets.",

The mathematical model of the continuum robot is built following the Cosserat rod theory and focuses on a single section Cosserat rod under arbitrary loading. The compliance of the robot is described as a set of ordinary differential equations with split boundary conditions. This new set of compliance equations is directly coupled to the solution of the forward kinematics of the robot. After solving the forward kinematics problem, these solutions can be directly used to compute the compliance. A particular class of continuum robots in which the compliance of the robot can be formulated as an initial value problem and solved in a single numerical integration is discussed. The paper provides experimental validation of the proposed method.",

Graph theoretic analyses ensure a structured way of describing a system and allow a straightforward extension to more complex systems. The graph models of a series elastic actuator, a variable stiffness actuator and a multi degrees of freedom compliant system are derived. These systems are controlled using an optimal control law that is able to find the optimal stiffness setting and distribution to accomplish a certain task. A case study shows a multi degrees of freedom compliant system which is required to resonate at the output and to accomplish a back-and-forth motion. It is shown that a constant optimal stiffness is found in the resonance simulation, and a varying optimal stiffness in case of the back-and-forth task. This indicates that this methodology can assist in finding an optimal stiffness distribution of complex robotic systems for a given task.",

This work focuses on the foot-terrain interaction and its effect on the motion of a one-legged system. This interaction is usually tackled by disregarding some of the effects of ground deformation like permanent deformation and compaction. Inspired by other areas of engineering, an impact dynamics model is developed, allowing a more thorough study of the behavior during fast dynamic walking. This approach can be regarded as a viscoplastic one. The monopod controller presented in previous work is extended to cope with deformable terrains, based on energy dissipation considerations, without requiring the knowledge of the ground parameters. Simulation results prove the validity of the theory presented.",

        "abstract": "Bio-inspired by moth or humming-birds, several micro air vehicles (MAV) have recently been developed. In these systems, the motion of the lifting surface is complex and modeled by flapping motion-controlled soft wings. The synchronization of the actuated periodic flapping motion of the wings and that of passive twisting degrees of freedom (dof) allows producing hovering flight. Depending on the feature of the MAV such as stiffness, and geometric characteristic, hovering flight can be naturally stable or not. In the first case hovering is obtained via an open loop control (or a local closed loop control) while in the second case a global control strategy is required to achieve the same objectives. Thus, it is crucial to take into account the influence of the design of the MAV on the control in order to choose an appropriate morphology that can reduce the burden of control. In this paper mathematical tools and methodologies are proposed to achieve this objective and reduce the computational cost of control.",

Especially in this decade, sampling-based motion planning methods have become popular thanks to recent high performance computers. In sampling-based motion planning, a graph that covers the state space is constructed based on reachability between node pairs, and the motion is planned using the graph. However, it requires an explicit model of a controlled target. In this research, we propose a motion planning method in which a system model is estimated by using Gaussian process regression. We apply our method to the control of an actual robot. Experimental results show that the control of the robot can be achieved by the proposed motion planning method.",

Fabrics represent a class of highly conformable materials that have the potential for embedded function and are highly integrated into our daily lives. In this work, we present a robotic fabric with embedded actuation and sensing. Attaching the same robotic fabric to a soft body in different ways leads to unique motions and sensor modalities with many different applications for robotics. In one mode, the robotic fabric acts around the circumference of the body, and compression of the body is achieved. Attaching the robotic fabric in another way, along one surface of a body for example, bending is achieved. We use thread-like actuators and sensors to functionalize fabric via a standard textile manufacturing process (sewing). The actuated fabric presented herein yields a contractile force of 9.6N and changes in length by approximately 60% when unconstrained. The integrated strain sensor is evaluated and found to have an RMS error of 14.6%, and qualitatively differentiates between the compressive and bending motions demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "In this paper a dynamic model is proposed for a wheeled mobile robot (WMR) that incorporates a novel slip characterization and is used to study navigation under hard control constraints. Many available dynamic models of WMR assume that either the wheels roll without slipping or has longitudinal slip only. As a result they do not necessarily capture the true dynamics of WMRs. The model proposed in this paper considers a two wheeled differential drive mobile robot moving on a flat surface with possibly non-zero lateral and longitudinal slipping. A novel slip characterizing model is introduced and defining parameters are estimated via a set of experiments. Compared with several existing models in the literature simulation results show that trajectories predicted by the proposed model agree better with experimental data. The introduced dynamics and the corresponding slip model coupled with a novel direction search scheme were then used to ascertain the reachable states under constrained control. The scheme involves a finite dimensional search procedure which eliminates having to deal with two point boundary value problems resulting from classic optimal control formulations. The results of the paper can be easily applied to the design of control schemes for WMRs under realistic surface topography and control input constraints.",

        "abstract": "This article suggests a novel path planning algorithm for a non-holonomic wheeled vehicle operating in a semi-structured environment. The first step of the algorithm is to compute offline a finite set of feasible motions connecting discrete robot states to construct a search graph. The motion primitives based on B\u00e9zier curves are generated by solving the constrained optimization problem (COP). Applying A* on the search graph produces paths in the form of a sequence of the primitives. Although the sequence is drivable and suboptimal, we perform online path smoothing to remove the jerky or extraneous motions. The post-procedure is done by using a gradient based method to solve another COP. The numerical simulations show remarkable performance improvement in the constrained path optimization by applying our algorithm, compared to other existing works. Also, field experimental results demonstrate successful generation of fast and safe trajectories for real-time autonomous driving.",

        "abstract": "Intelligent object manipulation is critical for a robot to effectively operate in a household environment. There are many grasp planners that can estimate grasps based on object shape, but these approaches often perform poorly because they miss key information about non-visual object characteristics. Object model databases can account for this information, but existing methods for database construction are time and resource intensive. We present an easy-to-use system for constructing a grasp database from crowdsourced demonstrations. The method requires no additional equipment other than the robot itself, and non-expert users can demonstrate grasps through an intuitive web interface, with virtually no training required. We show that the crowdsourced grasps can prove sufficient for object manipulation, and furthermore the demonstration approach outperforms purely vision-based grasp planning approaches for a wide variety of object classes.",

The fluidic axis-translation self-assembly process was experimentally demonstrated. Multiple hydrogels embedded microtube was constructed. The fabrication of GelMa microstructures was demonstrated. The degradability of cell embedded GelMa microstructures was evaluated by long-term observation, and it shows the great potential of GelMa to be used for constructing cellular vascular-like microtubes.",

Haptic AR modulates real haptic interaction to desired interaction by adding virtual haptic feedback. For haptic AR rendering, the measurement of real haptic interaction including deformation and friction force is important for accurate rendering, but the current haptic AR algorithms do not support it properly. The proposed method, derived from a simple model of rigid-deformable body contact, decomposes contact force into deformation force and friction force using force and tactile information. A finite element method (FEM) based simulation of contact between two objects was performed for the performance verification of the proposed method. The results showed the proposed method can decompose contact force more exactly than the conventional decomposition methods in haptic AR.",

Consequently, means to facilitate an efficient shared autonomy between human and robot are the subject of much research work in the field of robotics. This paper proposes a novel shared autonomy system, which recognizes the user intention by estimating the task the user is executing based on the context information, and provides motion assistance according to the inferences. To incorporate the uncertainty of contextual task recognition, a Gaussian Mixture Regression model combined with a recursive Bayesian filter is adopted, which is adaptive to the implicit user model for task execution during operation. The proposed method is applied to the problem of controlling a flying robot in the context of two task types: doorway crossing and object inspection. Its benefits are demonstrated by the simulation results.",

Underwater surface inspection is a challenging and hazardous task that demands sophisticated automation - as in boiling water nuclear reactors, water pipeline, submarine hull and oil pipelines inspection. EVIE is inspired by its predecessor, the Omni Submersible, in its ellipsoidal, streamlined, and appendage free shape. The objective for the robot is to carry inspection sensors - magnetic, acoustics or visual - to determine cracks on submerged surfaces. Unlike a robot moving in a practically boundless fluid, contact forces complicate the dynamics by bringing in normal and frictional forces, both of which are highly non linear in nature. This makes the modeling much more challenging and the development of an integrated controller more difficult. In this paper we will discuss the preliminary design and hydrodynamic modeling of such a robot. We analyze in detail the controls for one of the many transitional states of this robot. Eventually all transitional states need to be integrated to develop a hybrid dynamical system which shall use a controller that can adapt to its different states.",

        "abstract": "Magnetically actuated helical nanoswimmers have various potential applications from in-vitro microfluidics to invivo less invasive surgery. However these applications provide more challenging environments for the helical nanoswimmers by often limiting their mobility robustness from their limited motion dexterity. That is why we propose in this paper a multimodal Roll-to-Swim motion transition of helical nanoswimmers. The proposed Roll-to-Swim is a robust swimmer that takes advantages of both a rolling motion and a cork-screw swimming. The Roll-to-Swim can switch between these two different propulsion modes by simply controlling the direction and the frequency of the rotating magnetic field. We also show that the proposed system can be controlled either manually or by a closed loop with microscopic visual feedback. The system proved to be used for cargo transport of micro scale particles. Thanks to the demonstrated multi-motion transition and the cargo transport capabilities, Roll-to-Swimmers can be very promising and useful tools toward in-vitro microfluidics or in-vivo applications.",

Our control scheme takes advantage of the different capabilities of the robots. Since the system is highly redundant, the execution of multiple different tasks is possible. The primary task is aimed at keeping the UGVs well inside the camera field of view, so as to allow our localization system to reconstruct the identity and relative pose of each UGV with respect to the UAV. Additional tasks include formation control, navigation and obstacle avoidance. We thoroughly discuss the feasibility of each task, proving convergence when possible. Simulation results are presented to validate the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Networked systems and decentralized control strategies have been widely investigated in the literature, with the objective of obtaining coordinated emerging behaviors by means of local interaction. While typical approaches aim at solving regulation problems (e.g. synchronization, swarming, coverage, formation control) a few works have recently appeared that move towards the solution of more complex problems, such as tracking of arbitrary setpoint functions. Based on the formulation introduced in [1], this objective is obtained in this paper partitioning the networked systems into leaders (that can provide control inputs) and followers (that are controlled through local interaction). In this paper we provide a methodology for letting the leaders estimate the state of the followers in a decentralized manner: this estimate is then used for control purposes. Simulations are provided for validating the proposed control strategy.",

In this paper, we study the effect of a special type of force reflection algorithms, called projection-based force reflection (PBFR) algorithms, on the stability and performance of a dual-arm haptics-enabled teleoperator system for minimally-invasive surgical applications. In particular, the teleoperator system's performance is experimentally evaluated in three common tasks, which are knot tightening, pegboard transfer, and object manipulation, in the presence of negligible as well as non-negligible communication delays. The results obtained indicate that, in almost all cases, the PBFR algorithms demonstrate statistically significant improvement of performance in comparison with conventional direct force feedback.",

Adding mobile platforms, in particular nonholonomic mobile platforms, can expediently enlarge their working ranges but also introduces new challenges. The problem of the existing control methods for nonholonomic mobile manipulators is that they leave out the consideration of the differences between the mobile platform and the manipulator such as the dynamics differences and working condition differences. This may consequently result in some unnecessarily large errors for the motion tracking in the implementation. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new practical control method using the adaptive motion distribution and coordination between the mobile platform and manipulator to minimize the errors of the motion control and also automatically handle some unexpected events. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method were demonstrated through both simulation and experimental results.",

In this paper, we cast the evolving and complex structure of beliefs, and inference over them, as a planning and plan recognition problem. We use agent beliefs and intentions modeled in terms of predicates in order to create an automated planning problem instance, which is then used along with a known and complete domain model in order to predict the plan of the agent whose beliefs are being modeled. Information extracted from this predicted plan is used to inform the planning process of the modeling agent, to enable coordination. We also look at an extension of this problem to a plan recognition problem. We conclude by presenting an evaluation of our technique through a case study implemented on a real robot.",

We use COP to plan informative tours (cyclic paths) for persistent monitoring of an environment with spatial correlations, where the tours are constrained to a fixed length or time budget. The main feature of COP is a quadratic utility function that captures spatial correlations among points of interest that are close to each other. COP may be solved using mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) that can plan multiple disjoint tours that maximize the quadratic utility function. We perform extensive characterization of our method to verify its correctness, as well as its applicability to the estimation of a realistic, time-varying, and spatially correlated scalar field.",

        "abstract": "The robot coverage problem, a common planning problem, consists of finding a motion path for the robot that passes over all points in a given area or space. In many robotic applications involving coverage, e.g., industrial cleaning, mine sweeping, and agricultural operations, the desired coverage area is large and of arbitrary layout. In this work, we address the real problem of planning for coverage when the robot has limited battery or fuel, which restricts the length of travel of the robot before needing to be serviced. We introduce a new sweeping planning algorithm, which builds upon the boustrophedon cellular decomposition coverage algorithm to include a fixed fuel or battery capacity of the robot. We prove the algorithm is complete and show illustrative examples of the planned coverage outcome in a real building floor map.",

A new solution based on the Transferable Belief Model (TBM) framework is proposed in this article. It appears that this representation of knowledge affords numerous advantages over the classic probabilistic ones and leads to particularly good performances (an average of 3.2% translation drift and 0.0040deg/m rotation drift), especially when it comes to crowded environment. By introducing the basic concepts of a Credibilist SLAM, this article aims at proving that the use of this new theoretical context opens a lot of perspectives for the SLAM community.",

        "abstract": "For autonomous robots to operate successfully in unknown environments, their computer vision algorithms need to generalize over many different environments. However, due to practical considerations robotic vision experiments are typically limited to a single robot and a few (laboratory) environments. We propose crowdsourcing as a methodology for gathering large and varied robotic data sets. We evaluate the methodology by performing the first crowdsourcing experiment involving actual robots. In particular, we have made a space-game called `Astro Drone' for a toy quad rotor, the Parrot AR drone. Nine months after the game's release, there are 14,628 downloads and 840 contributions, consisting of visual features and drone state estimates. Data mining shows the methodology's potential, providing insights such as the relation between the number of visual features and obstacle distances.",

The algorithm builds upon a \u201cpush and swap\u201d paradigm that has been used effectively in centralized navigation. This push and swap approach was expanded to apply to decentralized planning by adding a waiting mode to handle situations in which communication between robots is lost. The completeness of the PSW algorithm can be guaranteed in cases where the environment can be modeled as a tree T for which the number of leaf nodes is greater than the number of robots navigating through it. The algorithm has a time complexity that is linear with the number of robots currently within communication, indicating that this algorithm is well suited for scaling to large systems of robots. To validate the PSW algorithm it was implemented successfully in multi-robot simulations and on hardware with four Dr. Robot Jaguar Lite Robots.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous agents that can communicate and make relative measurements of each other can improve their collective localization accuracies. This is referred to as cooperative localization (CL). Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) CL is constrained by the low throughput, high latency, and unreliability of of the acoustic channel used to communicate when submerged. Here we propose a CL algorithm specifically designed for full trajectory, or maximum a posteriori, estimation for AUVs. The method is exact and has the advantage that the broadcast packet sizes increase only linearly with the number of AUVs in the collective and do not grow at all in the case of packet loss. The approach allows for AUV missions to be achieved more efficiently since: 1) vehicles waste less time surfacing for GPS fixes, and 2) payload data is more accurately localized through the smoothing approach.",

We present the declarative Grasp Domain Definition Language (GDDL) which enables the explicit grasp-planner-independent specification of grasping problems.

Second, we introduce a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) to decode sEMG into the dynamic state similar as much as with the segmented result without hand position. Experimental data were collected to train both Bayesian MoG and HSMM, and cross-validation between segmentation and the decoding result were performed to verify the decoding accuracy of the HSMM. Finally, we verified that the decoding results successfully extracted a dynamic motor control strategy from sEMG data.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel exoskeleton system for gait rehabilitation, which allows natural pelvic movements. The developed lower extremity exoskeleton system, COWALK, has 14 degrees of freedom including four degrees of freedom for pelvic motion. From 113 healthy human subjects, 3D motion capture data were collected to determine mechanical design parameters and to generate gait patterns for the COWALK system. In order to reduce the affect of the weight of the robot, a gravity compensator was installed to support the weight of the robot. The performance of the COWALK system was validated by experiments. The experimental results from joint trajectories and pelvis movements show that the developed exoskeleton system can produce natural gait movements by augmenting the degrees of freedom for pelvic motion.",

        "abstract": "In the medical field, several surgical simulators and training platforms have been developed to help novice surgeons improve their surgical skills, as well as perform preoperative planning. In this paper, a haptic platform for surgical needle insertion training gestures is presented. Instead of relying on active actuators, an alternative solution, consisting in passive brakes based on Electro-Rheological (ER) fluids, is proposed, to provide a safe and realistic physical feedback to the physician. This platform generates a passive repulsive force against the user's movement, providing him/her a physical stimulus and, thus, a realistic haptic feedback. The goal of this project is to prove the reliability of ERF-based brakes to simulate the physical resistance of soft tissues against the movement of a surgical needle, in order to train unskilled practitioners in different scenarios. To achieve this objective, a prototype has been built, its kinematic model has been obtained and experimentally validated. The modelling, the bandwidth analysis and the force control scheme of the platform are also presented.",

These factors become particularly important when deploying the surgical system through a flexible path to areas with a tight workspace such as the stomach or oesophagus where high dexterity, flexibility, accuracy and stability are required. This paper presents a flexible access robot combining articulated joints and continuum flexible section for both transluminal and endoluminal surgeries. Kinematic model and control strategy for the flexible robot are described in the paper. The experiment simulating a transoral gastric procedure demonstrates great flexibility and dexterity of the device. The results show that good accuracy and repetitive control of the device are achieved, which demonstrate the potential application of the device for transluminal or endoluminal surgery.",

To exploit the full workspace of this kind of vehicles, depth control is needed and plays a critical role. Although depth control for large vehicles such as submarines has been addressed, this issue for low-cost, small-scale underwater vehicles has not received attention. In this paper, the depth control of a small robotic fish is studied, and implemented with the use of a small dc pump. The depth system dynamics are developed and limitations rising from the low-cost, small-scale actuators and sensors are described. A controller with limited feedback is designed, implemented and validated both by simulations and experiments. It is expected that this controller will add an important dimension to depth control of low-cost, energy-efficient small underwater vehicles.",

The method solution is based on an iterative algorithm that looks for a global optimum by iteratively identifying the optimum of three sub-problems. These sub-problems concern system layout design and motion planning for single and multi-robot systems, while collision detection is addressed. The sub-problems are handled through ad-hoc developed Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) models. The proposed solution overcomes the limitations of the current design and motion plan approaches. In fact, the design of body-in-white assembly cell and the robot motion planning are two time-expensive and interconnected activities, up to now generally managed from different human operators. The resolution of these two activities as non-interrelated could lead to an increase of the engineer-to-order time and a reduction of the solution quality. Thus, a test bed is described in order to prove the applicability of the approach.",

On the sensorized forceps, the combination of dual axial forces measured at each side of grasper presents three axial pulling and single axial grasping force sensing, which provide force feedback control using haptic device. It consists of simple structure of triangular prism shape and two capacitive-type pressure sensor cells based on elastomeric polymer which provides the information on normal and shear forces. The sensing principle is to compare the difference between responses of two pressure sensors when the surface of the sensor contacts to the tissue. A sensorized forceps is fabricated by employing the molding method and electronics for signal processing is embedded. Finally, experimental evaluations are performed and its feasibility is validated.",

        "abstract": "Haptic terrain display in Virtual Environments is important for increasing realism and immersion. While several terrain display devices exist, the Smart Shoe aims to render subtle terrain features while still being able to accommodate gross features, like sloped terrain. The compactness and portability of this haptic wearable device allows it to not only display terrain features on flat treadmill surface, but also potentially be able to compensate terrain unevenness to maintain level ankle posture for rehabilitation purposes. A novel elastomer based bladder system is designed to provide elasticity and support of the Smart Shoe. A mechatronic top plate is made by molding electronics and miniature solenoid valves into rubber material, providing sensing and control of pressure and height of the shoe. Evaluations of the Smart Shoe indicate promises to improve the haptic perception of different terrain features in a virtual environment.",

        "abstract": "The author has previously proposed a hopping mechanism using permanent magnets for small-scale exploration rovers. The main part of the proposed mechanism consists of one movable magnet and two stationary magnets. The mechanism uses for hopping the impact force generated when the movable magnet sticks to the stationary magnet. The features of the mechanism are that the large impact force can be generated in spite of low-power consumption, and it can be easily miniaturized and modularized. On the contrary, the weak point is that the performance of the mechanism cannot be controlled directly. To fully derive the potential ability of the mechanism it requires an appropriate design method to determine the design parameters such as the length and radius of magnets. This paper presents a design of the mechanism utilizing the estimation method of hopping performance of the mechanism proposed in the previous work. Also, an example of the design procedure in case the size of the mechanism has restriction is described.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "High-performance actuators are required for numerous novel applications such as human-robot assistive devices. The torque-to-weight ratio and energy efficiency of current actuation technology is often too low, which limits the performance of novel robots. Therefore, we developed a Series-Parallel Elastic Actuator (SPEA) which enables variable recruitment of parallel springs and variable load cancellation. Finding suitable intermittent mechanisms for the SPEA is however still challenging. This paper reports on the innovative design of an intermittent self-closing mechanism for a MACCEPA-based SPEA that can deliver bi-directional output torque and variable stiffness, while minimizing friction levels. Experiments on a one-layer intermittent self-closing mechanism are conducted to validate the working principle and the proposed model. A demonstrator of the MACCEPA-based SPEA with intermittent self-closing mechanism is presented and the experiments validate the modeled output torque and lowered motor torque for different stiffness settings.",

        "abstract": "This paper designs a new underactuated robotic finger using a special transmission mechanism. The transmission mechanism consists of a set of gears and a spring to produce connected motions and adaptive curling when the finger moves in free space and when it contacts with the environment, respectively. The connected motion is realized by kinematic constraints of the joints instead of the static equilibrium of joint elastic elements that are frequently adopted in underactuated mechanisms. The motor torque is effectively used to increase the gripping force due to the mechanism. In addition, a reduction of the transmission components also simplifies the assembly process and decreases the size and weight of the finger, which is useful in attaching it to the arm as a prosthesis.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "One standard procedure in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is the endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), where neoplastic mucosal tissue is being removed. To execute an ESD the surgeon needs to be well-trained and experienced to operate the flexible instruments precisely under visual monitoring. One of the main drawbacks is the unintuitive control of standard systems and the limited possibility for triangulation. Big motions on the endoscope's handle are transmitted into small movements of the endoscope's distal end inside the stomach and changing the field of view also changes the instrument's orientation and vice versa. We chose the ESD as a starting point to advance to Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) later on. To improve the ESD, we develop a telemanipulation system, mainly fabricated by selective laser sintering (SLS) of a biocompatible polymer. In this paper we present our spine-inspired kinematic driven via push rods and bowden cables that provides sufficient triangulation with a promising trade-off between flexibility to insert the systems into the patient and adequate stiffness to reliably manipulate the mucosal tissue. To connect the actuators, we use a magnetic coupling to separate sterile and non-sterile parts.",

Our motor-free design unifies the camera's fixation and manipulation by adjusting input currents in the stator which generates 3D rotational magnetic fields, and decouples the camera's locomotion into pan motion and tilt motion. In the simulation studies, our proposed design can conservatively achieve 360\u00b0 pan motion with a 22.5\u00b0 resolution, and 127\u00b0 ~ 164\u00b0 maximum tilting range for tilt motion which depends on tilt motion working modes and the distance between the rotor and the stator.",

Specifically, we consider hand performance when subject to external forces imparted to the hand from carrying a payload or from perching on a fixed item and explore the impact of design and grasp parameters including tendon routing/pulley ratio, object size, and palm size on the performance of both fully and underactuated designs. Our results show that underactuated designs utilizing a single actuator per finger are sufficient in all cases we studied, but that fully actuated designs can perform better for perching applications. Additionally, we find that increasing the palm width improves performance both when perching and grasping, and that a small distal/proximal pulley ratio is beneficial for payload carriage but counterproductive for perching.",

Printing is an adequate manufacturing method for the mass production; robots manufactured by printing can be low cost, rapidly creatable and easy to design. Paper is one of smart materials with high water absorbency and strength; it is easily mass-produced at low cost. Many inexpensive and flexible devices were created in paper electronics. Therefore, we propose paper mechatronics that merges printed robots and paper electronics. We used a commercial ink jet printer with water-based ink for self-folding of paper; the paper was folded automatically along the printed line to make the robot body. The paper robot was equipped with a printed electrothermal actuator that consists of epoxy resin covered by conductive ink. The epoxy resin was heated by Joule heat of the conductive ink under a driving voltage of 8 V. The self-folding of experimental paper robot took 15 minutes to construct the body and the robot demonstrated a locomotion at 6.5 mm per step.",

This spring-loaded, tendon-actuated cable-like continuum robot incorporates key features of a concentric tube style design with added local compression to most sections and actively controllable bending along its entire backbone. It also avoids a complicated and large actuator system. Such robotic cables can be well suited for current space and terrestrial applications like exploration, teleoperation, surveillance, maintenance activities, etc., benefiting from these unique structural properties.",

        "abstract": "Connection and disconnection occur often in modular robotics. Furthermore, position errors increase in chain-style modular robots as chains get longer. This paper presents a passive (unactuated) compliant two-layer latching mechanism compatible with planar docking mechanisms such as the X-Face, with design considerations and important design parameters empirically identified. Design parameters such as alignment, face curvature and overhang width are shown to have unintuitive effects on the behavior and strength of the connectors. The latch mechanism has a bonding ratio (force of the bond over force required to engage bond) in the range of 20 to 76, depending on the design parameters used. The paper also presents a reconfiguration control sequence that combines the module actuation forces with the connectors' natural forces to increase the reliability of the connection process and reduce the maximum force required. In addition, several types of reconfiguration are performed, including reconfiguration with a 12 module long chain that demonstrates the connectors' robustness to error.",

When we measure an opaque liquid in a cup with the depth camera, the liquid surface is measured. On the other hand, when we measure a transparent liquid, the raised bottom is measured due to the principle of light refraction and triangulation. We formulated it theoretically, and confirmed that the theory is consistent with the experimental results. Therefore, it is possible to detect the existence of liquids in cups using the measured height based on this theory. In our experiments, the proposed method have successfully detected various transparent or opaque liquids.",

The needle is a modified MRI-compatible biopsy needle with embedded fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors for strain detection. After calibration, the needle is interrogated at 2 kHz, and dynamic forces are displayed remotely with a voice coil actuator. The needle is tested in a single-axis master/slave system, with the voice coil haptic display at the master, and the needle at the slave end. Tissue phantoms with embedded membranes were used to determine the ability of the tip-force sensors to provide real-time haptic feedback as compared to external sensors at the needle base during needle insertion via the master/slave system. Subjects were able to determine the position of the embedded membranes with significantly better accuracy using FBG tip feedback than with base feedback using a commercial force/torque sensor (p = 0.045) or with no added haptic feedback (p = 0.0024).",

        "abstract": "In recent years, various background subtraction methods have been proposed and used in vision systems for moving object detection and tracking from moving cameras; however, most of them have difficulty in handling small and distant objects in complicated non-flat scenes. This paper presents a robust method to effectively segment moving objects from videos, captured by a camera on a moving platform. In our approach, a two-level registration is applied to estimate the effect of camera motion for motion compensation. After motion estimation and extraction of potential foreground pixels by Gaussian mixture model, noisy result is refined using component based and pixel based methods the latter of which uses the hidden markov model (HMM) for classifying pixels. Finally, foreground objects are tracked by a particle filter to exploit the temporal coherence of foreground motion and improve the detection accuracy through time. Experimental results show that our method outperforms competing methods for detecting moving objects in complex environments.",

        "abstract": "Depth sensors based on projected structured light have become standard in robotics research. However, when several of these sensors share the same workspace, the measurement quality can deteriorate significantly due to interference of the projected light patterns. We present a comprehensive study of this effect in Kinect and Xtion RGB-D sensors. In particular, our study investigates the effect of measurement failure due to interference. Our experiments show that up to 95% of the depth measurements in the interference image region can disappear when two RGB-D sensors interfere with each other. We determine the severity of interference as a function of relative sensor placement and propose simple guidelines to reduce the impact of sensor interference. We show that these guidelines greatly increase the robustness of RGB-D-based SLAM.",

In our method, a robot first builds a knowledge base by observing demonstrations of how certain objects are used and their proper handover grasp configurations. Objects in the knowledge base are then organized based on their movements and inter-object interaction features. The key point in this process is that similarity in affordances should be recognized. When subsequently asked to handover an object, the robot then computes an appropriate grasp configuration based on the object's recognized affordances. Experimental results show that our method was able to differentiate and group together objects according to their affordances. Furthermore, when given a new object, our method was able to generalize data in the knowledge base and determine an appropriate grasp configuration.",

Making use of reachability analysis, limitations due to input sampling as in previous approaches are avoided. Using reachability analysis the obstacles are grown in the state space. The mathematical background is shown in this paper and an exemplary algorithm is given for static environments. This implementation can handle arbitrary environments with multiple obstacles and different high-dimensional linear and non-linear system dynamics including the car-like kinematic model. By means of experimental results in simulated environments, the validity of the proposed concept is shown.",

        "abstract": "Our research focuses on the development of a socially assistive robot to provide cognitive and social stimulation during meal-time scenarios in order to promote proper nutrition amongst the elderly. In this paper, we present the design of a novel automated affect recognition and classification system that will allow the robot to interpret natural displays of affective human body language during such one-on-one assistive scenarios. Namely, we identify appropriate body language features and learning-based classifiers that can be utilized for accurate affect estimation. A robot can then utilize this information in order to determine its own appropriate responsive behaviors to keep people engaged in this crucial activity. One-on-one assistive meal-time experiments were conducted with the robot Brian 2.1 and elderly participants at a long-term care facility. The results showed the potential of utilizing the automated affect recognition and classification system to identify and classify natural affective body language features into valence and arousal values using learning-based classifiers. The elderly users displayed a number of affective states, further motivating the use of the affect estimation system.",

However, it is very important to observe eruption products inside of this area to predict the timing and scale of volcanic hazards, such as debris flows. Therefore, we propose a robotic observation system for active volcanoes that is composed of a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a mobile ground robot. To deliver the ground robot safely from the multi-rotor UAV to the ground, we implemented a sky-crane mechanism and confirmed the feasibility of the mechanism theoretically. In this paper, we introduce our volcano observation scenario as well as the observation system and sky-crane mechanism we have developed. Finally, we report on a field test conducted at Mount Asama in September 2013.",

In order to achieve this goal, the target motion of the device is focused on eating motion which is one of the most important task of daily life. Also, the exoskeleton is designed with soft materials such as fabric, rubber, wire and other compliant materials. The most rigid component used in the exoskeleton is a supporting part made of flexible board. By adopting these materials and concentrating on specific target motion, the number and size of the actuators can be reduced so that total complexity, weight and size of the device decrease. Also, the characteristics of soft material allows comfortable wearing sensation, low cost and good appearance. Therefore, the device becomes affordable and convenient. Polymyositis patients are chosen as the target user since the characteristics of their symptom can reduce complexity of the exoskeleton. Also a special controller is designed to utilize the available motion of the polymyositis patients. Some experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the exoskeleton.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the development of a robotic head that has cartoon facial expression ability with comic marks. For communicating with humans, robots should have expressive facial expression ability for indicating their inner state. Our previous research suggests that robots can express its emotion clearly if it performs facial expressions that are adapted to the cultural background of the communication partner. As a first step, we focus on making expressions for Japanese people. Comic mark is a unique and famous way of emotion expression in Japanese culture. First, we defined facial expressions by combining cartoon-like shape of the facial parts with high emotion recognition rates. Then we asked cartoonists to draw comic marks which they think are effective for emotion expression and find the effective comic marks as \u201cCross popping veins\u201d for \u201cAnger\u201d, \u201cTear mark\u201d for \u201cSadness\u201d and \u201cVertical lines\u201d for \u201cFear\u201d. Finally we obtained a model expression which has sufficiently high emotion recognition rate from the combination of the facial expression and the comic marks. In order to achieve these expressions, we developed flexible full color LED display matrix module and mechanism that push and pull the sheet for expressing black lines. Results of experimental evaluation shows that the new robotic head has over 90% average emotion recognition rates for each of the six basic emotions. The results with non-Japanese subjects suggests that impression of emotion expression on robotic head changes depending on the cultural background. These findings encourage us in pursuing this concept of designing robots that display emotions that are adapted to cultural background of communication partner.",

We expect a robot suit with the safety devices to be able to guarantee the safety even when the computer fails to operate functionally.

This idea of \u201ca single controller for different tasks\u201d differs from most controllers in its class because it does not intend to estimate certain parameters and change gain values like in adaptive control, nor does it perform switching of the control gains based on a certain condition. Instead it estimates changes in the parameters and external forces as disturbances. At the heart of the control is the Extended State Observer that performs this estimation and compensation. Discussion regarding the application of the controller to the wheeled inverted pendulum as well as tests that represent the planned tasks of the system is presented.",

        "abstract": "An essential tremor (ET) is a disorder that causes involuntary oscillations. ET patients face serious difficulties in performing such daily living activities as eating, drinking, and writing. We have been developing an exoskeleton to suppress tremors and support the eating movements of ET patients. The objective of this study is to propose a passive mechanism that prevents the appearance of the compensatory shoulder movement without using an actuator. The basic concept of this study is developing the mechanism to coordinate two DoF movement of elbow joint. Two DoF movement of elbow joint is constrained to passive one DoF by our wearable robot. The mechanism of our robot and constrain mechanism is optimally designed to reduce the compensatory movement during eating movement. To develop such mechanism, we first analysed the eating movement to derive the required specification of the mechanism. Then, we proposed a prototype based on the requirement. Finally, we evaluate the effect of the prototype to reduce the compensatory movement. It is confirmed that the proposed prototype had great effect on the reduction. As a future work, we will optimize the structure and the material of the mechanism to reduce the weight of the mechanism.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce our ongoing work on the development of an upper body exoskeleton robot, driven by a pneumatic-electric hybrid actuation system. Since the limb of an exoskeleton robot needs to have small inertia to achieve agility and safety, using a heavy actuator is not preferable. Furthermore, we need to use backdrivable actuators that can generate sufficiently large torques to support user movements. These two requirements may seem contradictory. In order to cope with this development problem, we use a hybrid actuation system composed of Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (PAMs) and small-size electromagnetic motors. Although we and other research groups have already presented the advantage of the hybrid actuation system, we newly propose the usage of Bowden cable in a hybrid actuator to transmit the force generated by the PAMs to joints of our exoskeleton robot so that we can design a compact upper limb with small inertia. In addition, small size electric motors are mechanically connected to joints in order to compensate uncertainty generated by the PAM dynamics and the Bowden cable. We demonstrate that the proposed joint is backdrivable with the capability of large torque generation for the gravity compensation task both in One-DOF system with a dummy weight and right arm of the upper body exoskeleton with a mannequin arm. We also show the right arm exoskeleton can be moved using a torque input, extracted from sensory information via a goniometer.",

A local environmental control technique is desired when analyzing the detailed and localized properties of single cells. In this paper, we propose a local environmental stimulation system with micro dual-pipettes to stimulate the local reagent concentration dynamically, freely and automatically. When the local environment is controlled with chemical stimuli, the chemical solution is diffused and affects other objects. The local environment stimulation system with micro dual-pipettes can solve this problem. By using spout pipette and suction pipette, it is possible to use local stimuli without affecting other objects. For evaluating the locality of the system, we use a fluorescent substance and measure the diffusion of the spouted solution.",

To facilitate dielectrophoresis-based manipulation, a multi-layer biocompatible scaffold structure utilizing its body as the integrated micro-electrodes was designed and fabricated using soft lithography. Voltage of opposite polarity was applied to the scaffold structure and the resultant electric field from the scaffold body polarized the cells in the culture medium and attracted them to migrate towards the scaffold body. Experiments were conducted and the results confirm that the proposed multi-layer scaffold is capable of generating dielectrophoretic forces to manipulate the cells to the scaffold surface, forming a three-dimensional cellular pattern automatically.",

The dynamical (rapidity) criterion is the worst isotropic linear acceleration starting from rest, and the precision related criterion is the worst translational resolution amplification factor. This latter amplification factor happens to be equal to the theoretical translational repeatability and accuracy amplification factors as well. Also, other kinetostatic and dynamic performances have been evaluated for the synthesized set of geometric parameters as to validate global performances. The results are quite interesting showing a highly performant parallel kinematic machine (PKM).",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Towards the goal of autonomous obstacle avoidance for mobile robots, we present a method for superpixel labeling using optical flow templates. Optical flow provides a rich source of information that complements image appearance and point clouds in determining traversability. While much past work uses optical flow towards traversability in a heuristic manner, the method we present here instead classifies flow according to several optical flow templates that are specific to the typical environment shape. Our first contribution over prior work in superpixel labeling using optical flow templates is large improvements in accuracy and efficiency by inference directly from spatiotemporal gradients instead of from independently-computed optical flow, and from improved optical flow modeling for obstacles. Our second contribution over the same is extending superpixel labeling methods to arbitrary camera optics without the need to calibrate the camera, by developing and demonstrating a method for learning optical flow templates from unlabeled video. Our experiments demonstrate successful obstacle detection in an outdoor mobile robot dataset.",

        "abstract": "Building an integrated mobile robot that can navigate freely and deliberately in an indoor environment is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a direction-driven navigation system, in which a mobile robot is instructed to follow the given directions instead of a global path. This is similar to humans when travelling to a target destination by following the directional guidance from someone else. This system consists of two main modules including a grid-based direction planner and a multilayered asymmetrical local navigation module. The directions of movement are computed from a brain-inspired spatial cognitive map using the grid-based direction planner, while the motion of the robot is controlled by the local navigation module. In order to improve the mapping performance using RGB-D input, an improved template comparison method is suggested. The proposed system is implemented in a mobile robot that performs simultaneous localization, mapping, and navigation in a typical office environment. The experimental results indicate that the robot can efficiently navigate to target destinations.",

        "abstract": "Effective robot collaborators that work with humans require an understanding of the underlying constraint network of any joint task to be performed. Discovering this network allows an agent to more effectively plan around co-worker actions or unexpected changes in its environment. To maximize the practicality of collaborative robots in real-world scenarios, humans should not be assumed to have an abundance of either time, patience, or prior insight into the underlying structure of a task when relied upon to provide the training required to impart proficiency and understanding. This work introduces and experimentally validates two demonstration-based active learning strategies that a robot can utilize to accelerate context-free task comprehension. These strategies are derived from the action-space graph, a dual representation of a Semi-Markov Decision Process graph that acts as a constraint network and informs query generation.We present a pilot study showcasing the effectiveness of these active learning algorithms across three representative classes of task structure. Our results show an increased effectiveness of active learning when utilizing feature-based query strategies, especially in multi-instructor scenarios, achieving better task comprehension from a relatively small quantity of training demonstrations. We further validate our results by creating virtual instructors from a model of our pilot study participants, and applying it to a set of 12 more complex, real world food preparation tasks with similar results.",

The ideal distance metric is the optimal cost of traversal between two states in the state space. However, it is computationally intensive to find the optimal cost while planning. We propose a novel approach to overcome this barrier by using a supervised learning algorithm that learns a nonlinear function which is an estimate of the optimal cost, via offline training. We use the Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator approach for estimating an approximation to the optimal cost and learn this cost using Locally Weighted Projection Regression. We show that the learnt function approximates the original cost with a reasonable tolerance and more importantly, gives a tremendous speed up of a factor of 1000 over the actual computation time. We also use the learnt metric for solving the pendulum swing up planning problem and show that our metric performs better than the popularly used Linear Quadratic Regulator based metric.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present flocking with cohesive configuration control \u2014 motion controllers that allow multiple robots to move through the environment as a coherent group while maintaining connectivity and density invariants. We start with a flocking controller from the literature. First, we produce a boundary force on robots that are on the internal and external boundaries of the configuration. This removes concave regions of the boundary, producing a convex configuration with uniform density. Second, we solve interstitial lattice errors caused by robots clumping too close together by moving them towards the boundary with a clump remover algorithm. Finally, we determine when a configuration is on the verge of disconnecting by identifying local articulation points; regions where the removal of a single robot will change the local topology. When one is detected, we switch modes to a clustering algorithm that draws robots to the vulnerable region. The combination of these algorithms produces a cohesive configuration controller. We verify our resulting controller with simulations from random initial conditions and selected extreme cases. Simulation results show the controller successfully forms a configuration with natural resting density in twelve of trials and maintains connectivity in twelve trials. We also provide real-world experiments to show that proposed algorithms work under low-resolution sensor platforms.",

Only if the available data can be structured, it can be queried and thus put into context. This is important because the variety of data and possible interpretations is tremendous, ranging from measurement values, sensor and robot descriptions/states/commands, to environmental data, such as positions, maps, spatial relations, etc. To cope with this diversity, we developed a solution capable of storing and accessing data within a distributed environment by providing additional context information. Furthermore, we describe how this information can be assembled in a task-oriented manner. This enables robots to dynamically generate environmental abstractions by using data from different sources and also enables them to incorporate external sensor measurements.",

Performing a musical piece using a robot is a difficult task because music presents many features like melody, rhythm, tone, harmony and so on. Addressing these tasks with a robot is not trivial to implement. Most of approaches which related to this specific field lacks of quality to perform in front of human audience. Implementation of human-like motions can not be properly achieved with a conventional robot actuator. Consequently, we exploit a new type of actuator which simplifies the drawbacks of a conventional one. We used Variable Stiffness Actuator(VSA) instead of using conventional actuator. We can control position, force, and stiffness, simultaneously by using VSA. The most important novel feature is its controllable stiffness. When the stiffness of the actuator is changed, the characteristics of the actuator's response also changes. We implemented the specific stroke which is called \u201cdouble stroke\u201d using one of variable stiffness actuator. Although the double stroke is known as a special stroke which could be performed by human only, double stroke is successfully implemented by stiffness variation.",

        "abstract": "Efficient manipulation requires contact to reduce uncertainty. The manipulation literature refers to this as funneling: a methodology for increasing reliability and robustness by leveraging haptic feedback and control of environmental interaction. However, there is a fundamental gap between traditional approaches to trajectory optimization and this concept of robustness by funneling: traditional trajectory optimizers do not discover force feedback strategies. From a POMDP perspective, these behaviors could be regarded as explicit observation actions planned to sufficiently reduce uncertainty thereby enabling a task. While we are sympathetic to the full POMDP view, solving full continuous-space POMDPs in high-dimensions is hard. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach in which trajectory optimization objectives are augmented with new terms that reward uncertainty reduction through contacts, explicitly promoting funneling. This augmentation shifts the responsibility of robustness toward the actual execution of the optimized trajectories. Directly tracing trajectories through configuration space would lose all robustness\u2014dual execution achieves robustness by devising force controllers to reproduce the temporal interaction profile encoded in the dual solution of the optimization problem. This work introduces dual execution in depth and analyze its performance through robustness experiments in both simulation and on a real-world robotic platform.",

Human player motion is measured by a motion capture system, using markers attached to each of the player's joints. Measurement information is converted to a state vector with Euler angles to indicate orientation of the sword and orientation of each part of the player's body. To model the motion as a nonlinear dynamical system, GMMs are generated from a demonstration set when an opponent is attacked. The efficiency of the proposed method is experimentally verified.",

Therefore a practicable model is needed that can be used for simulations and model-based control design. Neglecting rotational energies and assuming a continuum manipulator that consists of a single concentrated mass per section, dynamic equations for each actuator state are derived using the Euler-Lagrange formalism. Forces, positions and velocities are transformed to a global reference system using the homogeneous transformation based on constant curvature robot kinematics and its derivatives. Measurements of an example manipulator verify the resulting dynamic model that can be used to both simulate the dynamics and calculate the inverted robot dynamics needed for model-based controller design.",

However, the sensing characteristics between the reader and the tag (i.e. detections and signal strength) are challenging to model due to the influence of environmental effects (e.g. tag density, reflection, diffraction, or absorption). In this paper, we address the problem of dynamic objects tracking with a mobile agent using the signal strength from UHF RFID tags attached to objects. Our solution estimates the positions of RFID tags under a Bayesian framework. More precisely, we combine a two stage dynamic motion model with the dual particle filter, to capture the dynamic motion of the object and to quickly recover from failures in tracking. This approach is then tested on a Scitos G5 mobile robot through various experiments.",

This formulation provides two main advantages over a nonlinear Kalman filter for dynamic state estimation. QP does not require the dynamic system to be written in the state space form, and it handles equality and inequality constraints naturally. The QP state estimator considers modeling error as part of the optimization vector and includes it in the cost function. The proposed QP state estimator is tested on a Boston Dynamics Atlas humanoid robot.",

In the recent literature, the global dynamic trajectory planning problem of cable-suspended mechanisms was addressed and some of the characteristic properties of such robots were revealed. In this paper, actuation redundancy is introduced and the dynamic trajectory planning is addressed using straight line periodic trajectories and the application of the antipodal theorem. The results obtained show that introducing actuation redundancy increases the dynamic capabilities of the robots. Special frequencies are revealed that are similar to those encountered with non-redundant mechanisms. Additionally, an alternative architecture is proposed to deal with cable interferences and it is shown that the novel architecture leads to improved dynamic capabilities when compared to the original architecture.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a continuous control method of electric wheelchair based upon surface electromyographic signals (EMG), ultimately, for quadriplegics. The proposed method utilizes two EMG signals as inputs for the muscle-computer interfaces (MCI). Since Zygomaticus major muscles located in the right and left sides of human face are able to excise individually and to control contractile forces voluntarily, the surface EMG signals of both muscles satisfy core requirements for the development of EMG-based electric wheelchair control system, such as independent and continuous speed control of two wheels. For this, the envelopes of the signal waveforms are first extracted to reflect the moving average activities by using RMS (root mean squares) operations. Also, in order to obtain the desired linear and angular velocities of the electric wheelchair, the RMS signals are processed sequentially as follows; normalizing the RMS signals and then determining the control inputs of the electric wheelchair. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified through several experiments.",

Every time a vertex is revisited, the robot re-localizes and updates the uncertainty estimate accordingly. Finally, since the reduction of the map uncertainty remains one of the main concerns, the robot will optimize its schedule of revisiting junctions in the environment in order to reduce the accumulated uncertainty. Experimental results from a mobile robot equipped with a laser range-finder and results from realistic simulations that validate our approach are presented.",

        "abstract": "Most robots need the ability to communicate with a base station or with an operator during their mission. Teleoperated and semi-autonomous robots typically communicate continuously through a network connection with an operator. Transmitting raw sensor data over a low bandwidth network such as wireless or HSDPA, however, is problematic as the stream of sensor data is often large. In this paper, we present a method that exploits H.264 compression to reduce the size of range data streams from sensors such as the Kinect camera or the Velodyne 3D laser scanner. We developed a practical and effective solution that exploits the state of the art in video compression to produce high-quality results. Our method is easy to implement and can have practical impact for researchers building robots for the real world. We implemented and thoroughly tested our approach using a large number of range data streams. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of data compression on the accuracy and size of the transmitted data. We show that even a highly compressed stream of depth images can be used with dense mapping techniques such as KinFu for building environment models.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports our investigation into the effects of bodily mood expression of a humanoid robot in a scenario close to real life. To this end, we used the NAO robot to perform as a lecturer in a university class. To display either a positive or a negative mood, we modulated 41 co-verbal gestures by adjusting behavior parameters that control spatial extent and motion dynamics, without modifying gesture function. Unique in this study is that (a) the robot gave an actual lecture to real students, (b) the interaction is one-to-many and relatively long (30 min), and (c) mood modulation was applied to a large set of behaviors. The robot presented the same lecture either in a positive or a negative mood to two audiences (between subjects). Although statistical analysis does not show that participants consciously recognized the robot mood, the results do show that participants in the positive mood condition rated their own arousal significantly higher than in the negative condition. Further, video annotation showed increased valence and arousal of the audience in the positive condition. Finally, participants' ratings of the lecturing quality and the gesture quality of the robot are higher in the positive condition, demonstrating the importance of robot mood expression in a one-to-many interaction setting.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Model-based control is essential for compliant control and force control in many modern complex robots, like humanoid or disaster robots. Due to many unknown and hard to model nonlinearities, analytical models of such robots are often only very rough approximations. However, modern optimization controllers frequently depend on reasonably accurate models, and degrade greatly in robustness and performance if model errors are too large. For a long time, machine learning has been expected to provide automatic empirical model synthesis, yet so far, research has only generated feasibility studies but no learning algorithms that run reliably on complex robots. In this paper, we combine two promising worlds of regression techniques to generate a more powerful regression learning system. On the one hand, locally weighted regression techniques are computationally efficient, but hard to tune due to a variety of data dependent meta-parameters. On the other hand, Bayesian regression has rather automatic and robust methods to set learning parameters, but becomes quickly computationally infeasible for big and high-dimensional data sets. By reducing the complexity of Bayesian regression in the spirit of local model learning through variational approximations, we arrive at a novel algorithm that is computationally efficient and easy to initialize for robust learning. Evaluations on several datasets demonstrate very good learning performance and the potential for a general regression learning tool for robotics.",

        "abstract": "Motion primitives are an established paradigm to generate complex motions from simpler building blocks. A much less addressed issue is at which level to encode and organize a library of motion primitives, and how to retrieve motion primitives from a library that fit a particular task. This paper proposes a parameterized skill memory, which organizes a set of motion primitives in a low-dimensional, topology-preserving embedding space. The skill memory acts as a pivotal mechanism that links low-dimensional skill parametrizations to motion primitive parameters and complete motion trajectories. The skill memory is implemented by means of a dynamical system which features continuous generalization of motion shapes. It is shown that the low-dimensional skill parametrization is beneficial for efficient, reward-based retrieval of motion primitives and simplifies the shaping of reward functions. The excellent generalization of motion shapes by parameterized skill memories from few training examples is demonstrated in a bimanual manipulation task with the humanoid robot iCub.",

In order to compute optimal time, duration and position of footsteps along with the center of mass trajectory of a humanoid, a novel mixed-integer model of the system is presented. The introduction of this model in a predictive control problem brings the definition of a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program, subject to linear constraints. Simulation results demonstrate the simultaneous adaptation of the gait pattern and posture of the humanoid, in a walking activity under large disturbances, to efficiently compromise between task performance and balance. In addition, a push recovery scenario displays how, using a single balance-performance ratio, distinct behaviors of the humanoid can be specified.",

The method which has been proposed achieves precise control of robotic arms using visual feedback with camera calibration errors. In this paper, the method is improved for an encoderless robotic arm system to ease several difficulties to use encoders. Encoders are fundamental components of most robotic arm systems to control joint angles precisely. However, encoders sometimes make some difficulties of wiring, structure and maintenance. The enhanced method for encoderless robotic arm systems is able to overcome these difficulties. Moreover, this method is also useful for robotic systems which have encoders since the method is able to be activated as a fail-safe system of robots with encoders just in case encoders are broken down. This new approach acquires information on joint angles from not encoders but estimation using back electromotive force. The information on joint angles includes some errors. The method, however, realizes precise manipulation. It is finally shown that this method allows errors caused by not only from camera calibrations but also joint angles.",

However, soft limbs can not yet transition to practical application due to difficulties associated with control methods. Motivated by this research problem, in this paper, we investigate the performance of energy based control of underactuated soft limbed systems. We augment the previously reported energy shaping function for rigid bipeds with a new set of functions for the novel class of underactuated compass gait soft bipeds. We evaluate the controller performance and identify desired features and characteristics for better speed performance of such a biped. The proposed energy shaping functions are compared through controlled Lagrangian (CL) method for Euler-Lagrangian (EL) models and interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) methods for port-controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) models. Results for system stability, speed performance, and input torque profiles are compared. The IDA-PBC controllers are observed to produce better input torque and performance over the CL methods.The findings assist in extending and developing novel controllers to implement on soft limbed robots for practical control applications of soft multi-continuum limbed robots.",

        "abstract": "Robots that can reliably manipulate human tools can do a diverse range of useful tasks in human environments. However, these tools are often difficult to manipulate, particularly given force requirements for applying the tool. This is often due to the mismatch between the robot's gripper and the tool handle designed for human hands. In this paper, we present the design of a low-cost universal tool attachment that makes the tool gripper-friendly. We demonstrate the performance gain provided by the attachment on 10 different tools in the three stages of tool use: grasping the tool, applying the tool, and placing the tool. Our experiments demonstrate that the attachment performs significantly better in all three stages of tool use.",

        "abstract": "A Layered Hidden Markov Model (LHMM) has been usually used for recognizing various human activities. In such a LHMM, the performance tends to be improved than that of a single layered HMM. To further enhance the performance of such a LHMM, in this paper, we propose a brain-inspired feedback mechanism. For this achievement, the LHMM is first modeled using a set of training data that the semantic information (i.e., labels of data) is attached. In the inference phase, the semantic information is produced from the HMMs associated with the upper layers of the LHMM, and then the semantic information is used to improve the performances of the lower layers in the next inference step. Consequently, these interactive feed-forward and feedback information can dramatically improve the performance of the LHMM. To validate our proposed method, we compare the performance of our LHMM (i.e., with feedback mechanism) with that of a standard LHMM (i.e., with no feedback mechanism) using twenty-four human activities, which occur frequently when a human cooks.",

        "abstract": "Systematically developing high-quality reusable software components is a difficult task and requires careful design to find a proper balance between potential reuse, functionalities and ease of implementation. Extendibility is an important property for software which helps to reduce cost of development and significantly boosts its reusability. This work introduces an approach to enhance components reusability by extending their functionalities using plug-ins at the level of the connection points (ports). Application-dependent functionalities such as data monitoring and arbitration can be implemented using a conventional scripting language and plugged into the ports of components. The main advantage of our approach is that it avoids to introduce application-dependent modifications to existing components, thus reducing development time and fostering the development of simpler and therefore more reusable components. Another advantage of our approach is that it reduces communication and deployment overheads as extra functionalities can be added without introducing additional modules. The details of the plug-in system is described in the paper and its advantages for the development of robotics applications are demonstrated by developing a step-by-step example on the iCub humanoid robot.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a safety index and an associated formulation in the optimization-based path planning framework to assess and ensure the safety of human workers in a human-robot coexistence environment. The safety index is evaluated using the ellipsoid coordinates (EC) attached to the robot links that represents the distance between the robot arm and the worker. To account for the inertial effect, the momentum of the robot links are projected onto the coordinates to generate additional measures of safety. The safety index is used as a constraint in the optimization problem so that a collision-free trajectory within a finite time horizon is generated online iteratively for the robot to move towards the desired position. To reduce the computational load for real-time implementation, the formulated optimization problem is further approximated by a quadratic problem. The safety index and the proposed formulations are simulated and validated in a two-link planar robot and the ITRI 7-DoF robot with a human worker moving inside the workspace of the robots.",

        "abstract": "Physical exploration refers to the challenge of autonomously discovering and learning how to manipulate the environment's degrees of freedom (DOF)-by identifying promising points of interaction and pushing or pulling object parts to reveal DOF and their properties. Recent existing work focused on sub-problems like estimating DOF parameters from given data. Here, we address the integrated problem, focusing on the higher-level strategy to iteratively decide on the next exploration point before applying motion generation methods to execute the explorative action and data analysis methods to interpret the feedback. We propose to decide on exploration points based on the expected information gain, or change in entropy in the robot's current belief (uncertain knowledge) about the DOF. To this end, we first define how we represent such a belief. This requires dealing with the fact that the robot initially does not know which random variables (which DOF, and depending on their type, which DOF properties) actually exist. We then propose methods to estimate the expected information gain for an exploratory action. We analyze these strategies in simple environments and evaluate them in combination with full motion planning and data analysis in a physical simulation environment.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a trajectory clustering approach that groups trajectories without the need of manually-tuned distance thresholds. Contrary to trajectory clustering approaches that use continuous, often geometrically-motivated similarity measures, path similarity is binary. Similar to homotopy classes, path equivalence is based on the obstacles in the environment. The goal states are, however, not fixed, but the paths have certain length restrictions. The equivalence is efficiently checked by closing the paths with sampled intermediate trajectories and using point-in-polygon tests. The proposed algorithm has linear complexity in the number of paths for non-overlapping clusters and, under certain assumptions, also in the case of overlapping clusters. Experimental results from an integration into a path-planning-based road course estimation system are shown and compared to a traditional distance-similarity cluster analysis to demonstrate the performance.",

        "abstract": "Some aerial tasks are achieved more efficiently and at a lower cost by a group of independently controlled micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) when compared to a single, more sophisticated robot. Controlling formation flight can be cast as a two-level problem: stabilization of relative distances of agents (formation shape control) and control of the center of gravity of the formation. To date, accurate shape control of a formation of MAVs usually relies on external tracking devices (e.g. fixed cameras) or signals (e.g. GPS) and uses centralized control, which severely limits its deployment. In this paper, we present an environment-independent approach for relative MAV formation flight, using a distributed control algorithm which relies only on embedded sensing and agentto- agent communication. In particular, an on-board monocular camera is used to acquire relative distance measurements in combination with a consensus-based distributed Kalman filter. We evaluate our methods in- and outdoors with a formation of three MAVs while controlling the formation's center of gravity manually.",

This procedure is performed under image guidance and the contact force between the ablation tip and the heart tissue is one of the factors that greatly impacts the efficacy of the ablation procedure. This paper investigates the feasibility of estimating the force that the catheter tip exerts on the heart tissue by monitoring the changes in the shape of the deflectable distal shaft of the catheter (henceforth called the \u201cdeflectable shaft\u201d or the \u201cshaft\u201d of the catheter). It is shown that variations in the shaft curvature provide information about how much force the catheter tip is exerting at its point of contact. Consequently, an index is defined for determining the range of contact forces based on the shaft curvature. Experimental results show that the defined index can correctly detect the range of applied contact forces in more than 80% of the cases. This study proves that the flexibility of the deflectable shaft provides a means of estimating contact forces exerted by the catheter tip.",

        "abstract": "Physical human-robot collaboration is characterized by a suitable exchange of contact forces between human and robot, which can occur in general at any point along the robot structure. If the contact location and the exchanged forces were known in real time, a safe and controlled collaboration could be established. We present a novel approach that allows localizing the contact between a robot and human parts with a depth camera, while determining in parallel the joint torques generated by the physical interaction using the so-called residual method. The combination of such exteroceptive sensing and model-based techniques is sufficient, under suitable conditions, for a reliable estimation of the actual exchanged force at the contact, realizing thus a virtual force sensor. Multiple contacts can be handled as well. We validate quantitatively the proposed estimation method with a number of static experiments on a KUKA LWR. An illustration of the use of estimated contact forces in the realization of collaborative behaviors is given, reporting preliminary experiments on a generalized admittance control scheme at the contact point.",

        "abstract": "The Fukushima nuclear power plant accident that occurred in 2011 eastern Japan has created local spots with a high dose level in residential areas in eastern Japan. It is necessary to build a map of the distribution of radiation activities that shows the locations and intensities of radiation sources to assist in decontamination work. The proposed method estimates the intensities of point-like sources from the radiation dose measured by moving a dosimeter in three dimensions and 3D map of the environment, assuming that the radioactive sources are located on the ground surface. The radiation dose is measured as a few counts including a wide variability because in the proposed method, low levels of radiation are measured by moving a dosimeter. For estimating the intensities, the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation is computed on the basis of the radiation characteristics of attenuation and stochastic counts. Experiments of estimation in real environments were conducted. The experimental results showed that using the proposed method, it is possible to estimate the distributions of radiation sources using the radiation dose measured by a dosimeter and the measured 3D shape of the ground and building surface.",

Percutaneous cancer treatments can reduce the physical burden of cancer patients due to its minimally invasiveness and allow to treat small size tumors. Robotic needle placement has been proposed to overcome the difficulties of manual needle placement, which has not enough accuracy. Until now, researchers have focused on developing deterministic models for pre or intra-operative control. In this paper, we propose a novel approach by extracting patterns in needle insertion force that can provide information about the current status of needle tissue interaction. In particular, we focus in estimating the non-linear local elastic modulus and friction status in real-time during needle insertion.",

        "abstract": "With the goal of advancing the state of automatic robotic grasping, we present a novel approach that combines machine learning techniques and rigorous validation on a physical robotic platform in order to develop an algorithm that predicts the quality of a robotic grasp before execution. After collecting a large grasp sample set (522 grasps), we first conduct a thorough statistical analysis of the ability of grasp metrics that are commonly used in the robotics literature to discriminate between good and bad grasps. We then apply Principal Component Analysis and Gaussian Process algorithms on the discriminative grasp metrics to build a classifier that predicts grasp quality. The key findings are as follows: (i) several of the grasp metrics in the literature are weak predictors of grasp quality when implemented on a physical robotic platform; (ii) the Gaussian Process-based classifier significantly improves grasp prediction techniques by providing an absolute grasp quality prediction score from combining multiple grasp metrics. Specifically, the GP classifier showed a 66% percent improvement in the True Positive classification rate at a low False Positive rate of 5% when compared with classification based on thresholding of individual grasp metrics.",

        "abstract": "In the last few years, we have witnessed impressive demonstrations of aggressive flights and acrobatics using quadrotors. However, those robots are actually blind. They do not see by themselves, but through the \u201ceyes\u201d of an external motion capture system. Flight maneuvers using onboard sensors are still slow compared to those attainable with motion capture systems. At the current state, the agility of a robot is limited by the latency of its perception pipeline. To obtain more agile robots, we need to use faster sensors. In this paper, we present the first onboard perception system for 6-DOF localization during high-speed maneuvers using a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). Unlike a standard CMOS camera, a DVS does not wastefully send full image frames at a fixed frame rate. Conversely, similar to the human eye, it only transmits pixel-level brightness changes at the time they occur with microsecond resolution, thus, offering the possibility to create a perception pipeline whose latency is negligible compared to the dynamics of the robot. We exploit these characteristics to estimate the pose of a quadrotor with respect to a known pattern during high-speed maneuvers, such as flips, with rotational speeds up to 1,200 \u00b0/s. Additionally, we provide a versatile method to capture ground-truth data using a DVS.",

However this is very challenging due to the existence of noise, which may be input dependent, or heteroscedastic, and the restriction in the number of evaluations, due to robotic experiments which are expensive in time and/or money. This paper presents a multiobjective optimization (MOO) algorithm for expensive-to-evaluate noisy functions for robotics. We present a method for model selection between heteroscedastic and standard homoscedastic Gaussian process regression techniques to create suitable surrogate functions from noisy samples and find the point to be observed at the next step. This algorithm is compared against an existing MOO algorithm which assumes homoscedastic noise, and is then used to optimize the speed and head stability of the sidewinding gait of a snake robot.",

        "abstract": "Spacecraft proximity operations near an unknown and uncooperative and spinning target object is a challenging problem. One of the key steps in ensuring safe operations is building a map of the target object. Additionally, it is useful to estimate the relative position, orientation, linear and angular velocities of the object as well as its center of mass, principal axes of inertia and ratios of inertia so that the object's pose can be accurately propagated forward in time. This paper reviews an approach for building a map of an unknown and spinning object, and presents experimental results of this algorithm when it was run onboard the Synchronized Position Hold Engage Reorient Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) and Visual Estimation for Relative Tracking and Inspection of Generic Objects (VERTIGO) Goggles that are operating within the International Space Station. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time a solution to a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem has been run on a computer that is in space.",

        "abstract": "Lightweight RGB-D cameras that can provide rich 2D visual and 3D point cloud information are well suited to the motion estimation of indoor micro aerial vehicles (MAVs). In recent years, several RGB-D visual odometry methods which process data from the sensor in different ways have been proposed. However, it is unclear which methods are preferable for online odometry estimation on a computation-limited, fast moving MAV in practical indoor environments. This paper presents a detailed analysis and comparison of several state-of-the-art real-time odometry estimation methods in a variety of challenging scenarios, with a special emphasis on the trade-off among accuracy, robustness and computation speed. An experimental comparison is conducted using public available benchmark datasets and author-collected datasets including long corridors, illumination changing environments and fast motion scenarios. Experimental results present both quantitative and qualitative differences among these methods and provide some guidelines on choosing the \u201cright\u201d algorithm for an indoor MAV according to the quality of the RGB-D data and environment characteristics.",

LCS exist in natural fluid flows at various scales, and they are time-varying extensions of stable and unstable manifolds of time invariant dynamical systems. In this work, we present the first steps toward experimentally validating our previously proposed real-time manifold and LCS tracking strategy that relies solely on local measurements. Although we have validated the strategy in simulations using analytical flow models, experimental flow data, and actual ocean data, the strategy has never been implemented on an actual robotic platform. We demonstrate the tracking strategy using a team of micro autonomous surface vehicles (mASVs) in our laboratory testbed and investigate the feasibility of the strategy with vehicles operating in an actual fluid environment. Our experimental results show that the team of mASVs can successfully track LCS using a simulated velocity field, and we present preliminary results showing the feasibility of a team of mASVs tracking manifolds in real flows using only local measurements obtained from their onboard flow sensors.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we tackle the problem of estimating the local compliance of tactile arrays exploiting global measurements from a single force and torque sensor. The proposed procedure exploits a transformation matrix (describing the relative position between the local tactile elements and the global force/torque measurements) to define a linear regression problem on the unknown local stiffness. Experiments have been conducted on the foot of the iCub robot, sensorized with a single force/torque sensor and a tactile array of 250 tactile elements (taxels) on the foot sole. Results show that a simple calibration procedure can be employed to estimate the stiffness parameters of virtual springs over a tactile array and to use these model to predict normal forces exerted on the array based only on the tactile feedback. Leveraging on previous works [1] the proposed procedure does not necessarily need a-priori information on the transformation matrix of the taxels which can be directly estimated from available measurements.",

The tendon-driven continuum robot has the outer diameter of 3.4 mm and two bending sections. We have also newly introduced an extended forward kinematic mapping (FKM) with attention to the hysteresis operation of the robot. The extended FKM maps tension in tendons to the posture of the robot as time discrete valuables, and evolves the previous posture to the present posture. Through this computation process, the extended FKM performs mapping with the hysteresis. We conducted articulation experiments with the tendon-driven continuum robot to test the extended FKM. We measured the postures reached from two different initial postures as the hysteresis operation, and assessed the prediction accuracy of the postures in comparison to the FKM in our previous study. In the experimental results, the extended FKM predicted the postures in the hysteresis operation with improved accuracy (the maximum position error: 1.6 mm by the extended FKM vs. 3.5 mm by the FKM over 60 mm articulation length).",

Our approach uses equilibria of the dynamics as templates, which we connect to a family of period-one walking motions using numerical continuation methods. We define a gait as a fixed point of the walker's hybrid dynamics which resides in a state-time-control space consisting of the robot's post-impact state, switching time (the time at which the swing leg impacts the ground), and a finite set of design or control parameters. We demonstrate our approach on several physicallysymmetric biped walkers. In particular, we prove that our approach reduces the search space for an initial gait in the state-time-control space to a one-dimensional search in switching time. We show that we can generates periodic motion without resorting to splines or reference trajectories. Finally, we compare our method to generating gaits with virtual holonomic constraints.",

In this paper, an external torque sensing algorithm for the FJR is proposed to estimate both torques simultaneously by using the disturbance observing property of the disturbance observer (DOB). The proposed algorithm has no restriction of selecting Q-filter such that a high-performance low-pass filter can be applied for accurate estimation. The estimated torques can be very useful for FJR applications. As an illustrative example, the estimated actuating motor torque containing the motor disturbance is utilized to the motor disturbance compensation of the FJR with modified Q-filter due to the compensation feedback loop. The basic structure of the proposed algorithm is illustrated, and the performance is verified though a custom-designed experimental testbed for a vertical configuration with a gravitational load.",

Synthesizing human-like and stylistic motion variations according to specific scenarios is becoming important for entertainment robots, and imitation of styles is one variation which makes robots more amiable. Our approach extends a learning from observation (LFO) paradigm which enables robots to understand what a human is doing and to extract reusable essences to be learned. The focus is on styles in the domain of LFO and the representation of them using the reusable essences. In this paper, we design an abstract model of a target motion defined in LFO, observe human demonstrations through the model, and formulate the representation of styles in the context of LFO. Then we introduce a framework of generating robot motions that reflect styles which are automatically extracted from human demonstrations. To verify our proposed method we applied it to a ring toss game, and generated robot motions for a physical humanoid robot. Styles from each of three random players were extracted automatically from their demonstrations, and used for generating robot motions. The robot imitates the styles of each player without exceeding the limitation of its physical constraints, while tossing the rings to the goal.",

        "abstract": "The integration of several range cameras in a mobile platform is useful for applications in mobile robotics and autonomous vehicles that require a large field of view. This situation is increasingly interesting with the advent of low cost range cameras like those developed by Primesense. Calibrating such combination of sensors for any geometric configuration is a problem that has been recently solved through visual odometry (VO) and SLAM. However, this kind of solution is laborious to apply, requiring robust SLAM or VO in controlled environments. In this paper we propose a new uncomplicated technique for extrinsic calibration of range cameras that relies on finding and matching planes. The method that we present serves to calibrate two or more range cameras in an arbitrary configuration, requiring only to observe one plane from different viewpoints. The conditions to solve the problem are studied, and several practical examples are presented covering different geometric configurations, including an omnidirectional RGB-D sensor composed of 8 range cameras. The quality of this calibration is evaluated with several experiments that demonstrate an improvement of accuracy over design parameters, while providing a versatile solution that is extremely fast and easy to apply.",

Previous methods utilized a plane or an intersecting line of two planes as a geometric constraint with enough common field-of-view. These required additional sensors to calibrate non-overlapping systems. In this paper, we present two methods for solving the problem - one utilizes a plane; the other utilizes an intersecting line of two planes. For each method, an initial solution of the relative positions of a non-overlapping camera and a laser sensor, was computed by adopting a reasonable assumption about geometric structures. Then we refined it via non-linear optimization, even if the assumption was not perfectly satisfied. Both simulation results and experiments using real data showed that the proposed methods provided reliable results compared to ground-truth, and similar or better results than those provided by a conventional method.",

The effectiveness is validated with a simulation of falling prevention.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel approach for place recognition and loop closure detection based on binary codes and disparity information using stereo images. Our method (ABLE-S) applies the Local Difference Binary (LDB) descriptor in a global framework to obtain a robust global image description, which is initially based on intensity and gradient pairwise comparisons. LDB has a higher descriptiveness power than other popular alternatives such as BRIEF, which only relies on intensity. In addition, we integrate disparity information into the binary descriptor (D-LDB). Disparity provides valuable information which decreases the effect of some typical problems in place recognition such as perceptual aliasing. The KITTI Odometry dataset is mainly used to test our approach due to its varied environments, challenging situations and length. Additionally, a loop closure ground-truth is introduced in this work for the KITTI Odometry benchmark with the aim of standardizing a robust evaluation methodology for comparing different previous algorithms against our method and for future benchmarking of new proposals. Attending to the presented results, our method allows a fast and more effective visual loop closure detection compared to state-of-the-art algorithms such as FAB-MAP, WI-SURF and BRIEF-Gist.",

The relaxation causes larger penetrations at contact points, which are compensated the penetrations at the momentum-level by low computation cost. In addition, a novel friction model was proposed. This model enables to compute the static friction more stably. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by comparing with the microscopic and macroscopic methods with simulation of 6DOF pendulum's motion.",

The motivation for multi-arm manipulation comes from the wide range of applications. The possible tasks that can be performed by such a system greatly exceed those of a single manipulator system. The proposed system is flexible with respect to uncertainties in object size. Moreover, it allows for physical human interaction through force/torque sensing. This is especially beneficial in industrial cases where humans and robots work on the same production line. One main goal of this paper is to bridge the gap between current research regarding dual-arm manipulation and the implementation possibilities on current industrial robots and widely available standard hardware.",

For most objects, one point cloud is enough. For other objects, at most two point clouds are enough to synthesize reliable grasp. Taking grasping range and width of robot hand into consideration, the most suitable grasping region can be calculated on the contour of the point cloud of unknown object by maximizing the coefficient of force balance. Further analysis of the point cloud in the best grasping region can obtain the grasping position and orientation of robot hand. The point cloud information is processed on line, the grasping algorithm can quickly get the grasping position and orientation and then drive robot to the grasping point to execute grasping action. Simulations and experiments on an Universal arm UR5 and an underactuated Lacquey Fetch gripper are used to examine the performance of the algorithm, and successful results are obtained.",

We present a new hybrid metric-topological-semantic map structure, called MTS-map, that allows a fine metric-based navigation and fast coarse query-based localisation. It consists of local sub-maps connected through two topological layers at metric and semantic levels. Semantic information is used to build concise local graph-based descriptions of sub-maps. We propose a robust and efficient algorithm that relies on MTS-map structure and semantic description of sub-maps to relocate very fast. We combine the discriminative power of semantics with the robustness of an interpretation tree to compare the graphs very fast and outperform state-of-the-art-techniques. The proposed approach is tested on a challenging dataset composed of more than 13000 real world images where we demonstrate the ability to relocate within 0.12ms.",

In such model learning problems, the model parameters can be linearly decoupled from system variables in the feature space.

        "abstract": "We address the challenge of finding and navigating to an object with an attached ultra-high frequency radio-frequency identification (UHF RFID) tag. With current off-the-shelf technology, one can affix inexpensive self-adhesive UHF RFID tags to hundreds of objects, thereby enabling a robot to sense the RF signal strength it receives from each uniquely identified object. The received signal strength indicator (RSSI) associated with a tagged object varies widely and depends on many factors, including the object's pose, material properties and surroundings. This complexity creates challenges for methods that attempt to explicitly estimate the object's pose. We present an alternative approach that formulates finding and navigating to a tagged object as an optimization problem where the robot must find a pose of a directional antenna that maximizes the RSSI associated with the target tag. We then present three autonomous robot behaviors that together perform this optimization by combining global and local search. The first behavior uses sparse sampling of RSSI across the entire environment to move the robot to a location near the tag; the second samples RSSI over orientation to point the robot toward the tag; and the third samples RSSI from two antennas pointing in different directions to enable the robot to approach the tag. We justify our formulation using the radar equation and associated literature. We also demonstrate that it has good performance in practice via tests with a PR2 robot from Willow Garage in a house with a variety of tagged household objects.",

We consider evenly spacing the robots in a cyclic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) tour or partitioning the graph of the environment. The trade-off in performance, overall team travel cost and coordination is analyzed in this paper. We provide both a theoretical analysis and simulation results across multiple environments. The results demonstrate that generally cyclic-based strategies are superior, especially when small teams are used but at the expense of greater team cost, whereas partitioning strategies are especially suitable for larger teams and unbalanced graph topologies. The reported results show that graph topology and team size are fundamental to determine the best choice for a patrol strategy.",

        "abstract": "The Stapedotomy is a standard ENT (ear, nose and throat) surgery, where the surgeons use surgical micro hooks and forceps to replace the stapes with a small titanium implant. However, there are some challenges with this procedure. Especially, the non-ergonomic posture of the surgeon increases the hand tremor and leads to an inaccurate positioning of the implant. This may cause hearing loss and the patient may need a revision operation. In this paper, we present the first laser sintered disposable manipulator for ENT surgery, which allows the surgeon to move a micro hook in three directions via a joystick console, while his/her hands are located on an armrest. This may increase the surgical outcome by enhancing the ergonomics and therefore may reduce the number of revision operations. We show that the fabrication cost of the single-use robot does not increase the operation expenses drastically. To conclude, our preliminary evaluation with a middle ear phantom indicates that a basic surgical maneuver can be performed via the presented robotic system.",

The flapper design consists of two carbon fiber beams with a thin viscoelastic material sandwiched between them. When the beams are actuated to move relative to each other tangentially, the entire assembly curves out of the plane of symmetry creating a flapping motion. A model for the mechanism is presented, and the model's predictions for flapper deformation and energy consumption are verified with experiments. A closed-form solution is presented for the case of a static flapper with uniform properties along its length. The model is a powerful tool to predict the response of the flapper to changes in material parameters or dimensions. A flapper with varying dimensions along its length is also characterized experimentally, and compared with a uniform flapper.",

Unfortunately, it is a topic that has received little attention in the robotics literature. The study of the fleet size will allow for the design and implementation of more effective techniques and coordination methods for multi-robot systems. In this paper we study the effects of the fleet size on the time of exploration of a structured environment. We present an analysis that allows us to specify the maximum fleet size that provides the maximum reduction on the exploration time when the structured environment is modeled as a tree. The analysis is applied to the Multi-Robot Depth First Search (MR-DFS) algorithm that allows for maximum parallelism when an exploration process starts from a single point. The analysis provides an expression for the average time of exploration of a tree and for the maximum number of robots that produces a significant reduction on the exploration time.",

From object recognition to object grasping motion, the motion execution should be as fast as possible. Due to the possible position variation of the target object to be grasped, online planning of grasping motion should be done. In order to achieve flexible grasping motion, recurrent neural network could be implemented as an alternative to conventional manipulation method which is based on kinematic and dynamic analysis. However, the application of recurrent neural network model requires good and easily obtainable training data. Hence, a novel robotic arm design with high flexibility is proposed to facilitate the training and implementation of the recurrent neural network model. The feasibility of the proposed robotic arm design is evaluated via the training, learning and testing of stochastic continuous time recurrent neural network (S-CTRNN) model with grasping a box motion.",

        "abstract": "Tensegrity robots are composed of compression elements (rods) that are connected via a network of tension elements (cables). Tensegrity robots provide many advantages over standard robots, such as compliance, robustness, and flexibility. Moreover, sphere-shaped tensegrity robots can provide non-traditional modes of locomotion, such as rolling. While they have advantageous physical properties, tensegrity robots are hard to control because of their nonlinear dynamics and oscillatory nature. In this paper, we present a robust, distributed, and directional rolling algorithm, \u201cflop and roll\u201d. The algorithm uses coevolution and exploits the distributed nature and symmetry of the tensegrity structure. We validate this algorithm using the NASA Tensegrity Robotics Toolkit (NTRT) simulator, as well as the highly accurate model of the physical SUPERBall being developped under the NASA Innovative and Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program. Flop and roll improves upon previous approaches in that it provides rolling to a desired location. It is also robust to both unexpected external forces and partial hardware failures. Additionally, it handles variable terrain (hills up to 33% grade). Finally, results are compatible with the hardware since the algorithm relies on realistic sensing and actuation capabilities of the SUPERBall.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The Kuka LWR is equipped with torque sensors mounted into the actuated joints. Each torque sensor is calibrated separately before it is mounted on the robot. This needs a second calibration at the last stage of the assembling of the robot in order to take into account the effect of the robot structure through it's jacobian matrix. This final calibration is necessary to improve the accuracy of the estimation of the interaction wrench of the robot with its environment. However, the proposed calibration techniques are usually complicated, time-consuming, and must be carried out before assembling the sensors on the robot. In this paper, a simple and fast method for calibrating the sensors once they are assembled on the robot is presented. The method is based on the least squares solution of an over-determined linear system obtained with the robot inverse dynamic identification model in which are included the sensor gains. This model is calculated with available sensor measurement and joint position sampled data while the robot is tracking some reference trajectories without load on the robot and some trajectories with a known payload fixed on the robot. The method is experimentally validated on the Kuka LWR4+ but can be applied to any similar kind of robot equipped with joint torque sensors.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a force/vision control strategy is proposed in order to separate soft deformable materials using cooperative robots. The separation is performed by repeating a series of cuts, called passages, along a curved trajectory. The vision control is used to locally update the robot trajectory in response to both on-line deformations and off-line modeling errors. The force controller is used to ensure that the cut is performed without global deformation or damage to the surrounding area. The second robot is used to facilitate the cutting by applying external forces to the object. The control scheme is validated experimentally by cutting soft foam material.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "An increasing amount of robotic systems is developed for safety-critical scenarios, such as automated cars operating in public road traffic or robots collaborating with humans in flexible manufacturing systems. For this reason, it is important to provide methods that formally verify the safety of robotic systems. This is challenging since robots operate in continuous action spaces in partially unknown environments so that there exists no finite set of scenarios that can be verified before deployment. Verifying the safety during the operation based on the current perception of the environment is often infeasible due to the computational demand of formal verification methods. In this work, we compute sets of behaviors for parameterized motion primitives using reachability analysis, which is used to build a maneuver automaton that connects motion primitives in a safe way. Thus, the computationally expensive task of building a maneuver automaton is performed offline. The proposed analysis method provides the whole set of possible behaviors so that it can be verified whether forbidden state-space regions are avoided during the operation of the robot, to e.g. avoid colliding with obstacles. The method is applied to continuous sets of parameterized motion primitives, making it possible to verify infinitely many motions within the parameter space, which to the best knowledge of the authors has not been published before. The approach is demonstrated for collision avoidance of road vehicles.",

We present a software framework for cooperative traded control that enables a team of operators to control a remote humanoid robot over an unreliable communications link. The framework produces statically-stable motion trajectories that are collision-free and respect end-effector pose constraints. After operator confirmation, these trajectories are sent over the data link for execution on the robot. Additionally, we have defined a clear operational procedure for the operators to manage the teleoperation task. We applied our system to the valve turning task in the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC). Our framework is able to perform reliably and is resilient to unreliable network conditions, as we demonstrate in a set of test runs performed remotely over the internet. We analyze our approach and discuss lessons learned which may be useful for others when designing such a system.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel control strategy for running of bipedal robots with compliant legs. To achieve this goal and to take advantage of the characteristics of the template, we match the dynamics of the full multibody model of a real biped robot with the dynamics of a well-known running template called spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model. This can be viewed as a template and anchor approach. Because the SLIP model is theoretically conservative, it always operates at a constant energy level. However, real robots operate at various energy levels due to the positive and/or negative work done by the motors, inherent damping/friction of the components and more importantly, the regular ground impact that occurs during the running process. As a case study the proposed controller was implemented on a simulation of the bipedal robot called ATRIAS. The full dynamic equations for running of the ATRIAS robot are derived using the Lagrangian approach. To make our multibody biped robot run with a steady and stable gait that tracks the SLIP model dynamics, a two-level controller is proposed. The upper level controller in stance phase is designed with feedback linearization to make the active SLIP model follow the SLIP model trajectory. The lower level controller in stance phase is designed for the multibody model to track the toe force profile of the active SLIP model. Two active SLIP architectures are proposed for locked and unlocked torso cases of the robot. Simulation results demonstrate stable running based on this strategy for both cases of the ATRIAS model with locked and unlocked torso angle. Matching the SLIP dynamics on running biped robots not designed for spring-mass gaits is impossible due to actuator limitations, or, at best, inefficient.",

        "abstract": "In order to make unintentional physical interaction with robots safer for humans, we consider compliant control of an omnidirectional wheeled base. In this paper we present a fully holonomic mobile robot system which achieves compliant motion via force control, improving over previous pseudo-omnidirectional mobile systems by being fully omnidirectional.We explain our robot's drive train, and present an experimental validation of our actuator control strategy. Using a smith predictor and a simple delay-based plant model, we demonstrate compliance and safe interaction in both the mobile system alone and as the base of a wheeled mobile manipulator style system.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a method for fusing optical flow and inertial measurements. To this end, we derive a novel visual error term which is better suited than the standard continuous epipolar constraint for extracting the information contained in the optical flow measurements. By means of an unscented Kalman filter (UKF), this information is then tightly coupled with inertial measurements in order to estimate the egomotion of the sensor setup. The individual visual landmark positions are not part of the filter state anymore. Thus, the dimensionality of the state space is significantly reduced, allowing for a fast online implementation. A nonlinear observability analysis is provided and supports the proposed method from a theoretical side. The filter is evaluated on real data together with ground truth from a motion capture system.",

A Fuzzy Model Reference Learning Controller is used to adapt the Fuzzy Inference System according to the minimum jerk trajectory model. To evaluate the performance of the proposed controller a point-to-point cooperation task is conducted with multiple subjects using a KUKA LWR robot.",

Contrary to the existing works, we rely only on GPS information. First, we propose a fast implementation of Kalman filtering of spline-based road modeling. Our approach demonstrates a significant boost of the computation speed while maintained a good estimation error. Secondly, we perform an evaluation of our algorithm on real world data. Our estimation is compared to a high grade Inertial Navigation System and vectorial data gathered from major map providers. Our results suggest that a good performance can be achieved from the fusion of multiple GPS traces collected from multiple vehicles and drivers.",

A complete solution combining vision sensing, garment segmentation and understanding, planning of the manipulation and its real execution on a robot is proposed. A new polygonal model of a garment is introduced. Fitting the model into a segmented garment contour is used to detect garment landmark points. It is shown how folded variants of the unfolded model can be derived automatically. Universality and usefulness of the model is demonstrated by its favorable performance within the whole folding procedure which is applicable to a variety of garments categories (towel, pants, shirt, etc.) and evaluated experimentally using the two armed robot. The principal novelty with respect to the state of the art is in the new garment polygonal model and its manipulation planning algorithm which leads to the speed up by two orders of magnitude.",

Unlike previous fibrillar structures that use peel angle to control the manipulation of parts, we developed an elastomer micro-fiber adhesive that is fabricated on a soft, flexible membrane, increasing the adaptability to non-planar three-dimensional (3D) geometries and controllability in adhesion. The adhesive switching ratio (the ratio between the maximum and minimum adhesive forces) of the developed gripper was measured to be around 204, which is superior to previous works based on peel angle-based release control methods. Adhesion control mechanism based on the stretch of the membrane and superior adaptability to non-planar 3D geometries enable the micro-fibers to pick-and-place various 3D parts as shown in demonstrations.",

        "abstract": "Positioning a group of robots at the center of their geodesic voronoi cells minimizes the worst-case response time for any robot to arrive at an exogenous event in the workspace. We construct these cells in a distributed fashion, building on our prior work on triangulating unknown spaces with multi-robot systems. This produces a physical data structure - a set of triangles formed by the positions of the robots that can be used to perform coverage control. This paper presents: 1) A discrete approximation of the geodesic Voronoi cell using the multi-robot triangulation. We call this a topological Voronoi cell, and show that it can be computed efficiently in a distributed fashion and with theoretical guarantees compared to continuous version. 2) A local motion controller to guide navigating robots to the centroid of their topological Voronoi cell. This controller uses bounded communications with a fixed constant, but can produce local extrema that trap navigating robots away from the optimal position. 3) An enhanced local controller using navigation agents to help guide the navigating robot to the optimal position in its Voronoi cell. It also uses bounded communications, but with a constant that can be tuned to trade communications bandwidth for increased accuracy. 4) Hardware experiments that compute the topological Voronoi cell on a group of 14 robots, simulation results that demonstrate local extrema, and the effectiveness of the virtual navigation agents, and simulation results comparing the performance of the patrolling algorithm using and not using topological Voronoi cells.",

This paper presents a new telepresence robot with gesture-based attention direction to orient the robot towards attention targets according to human deictic gestures. Gesture-based attention direction is realized by combining Localist Attractor Network (LAN) and Short-Term Memory (STM).We also propose audio-visual fusion based on context-dependent prioritization among the 3 types of audio-visual cues (gesture, speech source location, head location). Experiment results are very promising and show that i) the average gesture recognition rate is 92%, i) gesture-based attention direction rate is 90%, and that ii) only by considering the 3 types of audio-visual cues together can the robot perform on par with a human in directing attention to the correct person in a meeting scenario.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a method for autonomous robot exploration of unknown objects by sensor fusion of 3D range data. The approach aims at overcoming the physical limitation of the minimum sensing distance of range sensors. Two range sensors are used with complementary characteristics mounted in eye-in-hand configuration on a robot arm. The first sensor operates at mid-range and is used in the initial phase of exploration when the environment is unknown. The second sensor, which provides short-range data, is used in the following phase where the objects are explored at close distance through next best view planning. Next best view planning is performed using a volumetric representation of the environment. A complete point cloud model of each object is finally computed by global registration of all object observations including mid-range and short range views. In experiments performed in environments with multiple rigid objects the global registration algorithm has proven more accurate than a standard sequential registration approach.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "For such common tasks as motion planning or object recognition robots need to perceive their environment and create a dense 3D map of it. A recent breakthrough in this area was the KinectFusion algorithm [16], which relies on step by step matching a depth image to the map via ICP to recover the sensor pose and updating the map based on that pose. In so far it ignores techniques developed in the graph-SLAM area such as fusion with odometry, modeling of uncertainty and distributing an observed inconsistency over the map. This paper presents a method to integrate a dense geometric truncated signed distance function (TSDF) representation as KinectFusion uses with a sparse parametric representation as common in graph SLAM. The key idea is to have local TSDF sub-maps attached to reference nodes in the SLAM graph and derive graph-SLAM links via ICP by matching a map to a depth image. By moving these reference nodes according to the graph-SLAM estimate, the overall map can be deformed without touching individual sub-maps so that re-building of sub-maps is only needed in case of significant deformation within a sub-map. Also, further information can be added to the graph as common in graph SLAM. Examples are odometry or the fact that the ground is roughly but not exactly planar. Additionally, the paper proposes a modification of the KinectFusion algorithm to improve handling of long range data by taking the range dependent uncertainty into account.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss information that is beneficial to robotic grasp planning and can be extracted from human demonstration. We present a method that integrates grasp intention: grasp type, and the relative thumb positions and orientations on the grasped object to the force-closure-based grasp planning procedure. Instead of completely mimicking the human grasp, grasp type and the relative thumb position are partially extracted from the demonstration to represent the task properties and grasp strategies, and avoid the challenging kinematic correspondence problem. Instead of mapping the demonstrated motion, the grasp type and thumb position provide meaningful constraints on hand posture and wrist position. Both the feasible workspace of a robotic hand and the search space of grasp planning are thereby highly reduced by the constraints. This approach has been evaluated in a simulation with a Barrett hand and a Shadow hand on eight daily objects.",

Even though constricted parts can be grasped more firmly than convex parts, previous planners have not sufficiently focused on grasping this part. We develop techniques for quadric surface approximation, grasp posture generation, and stability evaluation for grasping constricted parts. By modeling an object into multiple quadric surfaces, the planner generates a grasping posture by selecting one-sheet hyperbolic surfaces or two adjacent ellipsoids as constricted parts. When a grasping posture being generated, the grasp stability is evaluated based on the distribution of the stress applied to an object by the fingers. We perform several simulations and experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

One such application is search and detection of an evader in urban areas. This paper draws on results in graph-based pursuit-evasion, developing mappings from these abstractions to primitive motions that may be performed by aircraft, to produce search strategies providing guaranteed capture of roadbound targets. The first such strategy is applicable to evaders of arbitrary speed and agility, offering a conservative solution that is insensitive to motion constraints pursuers may possess. This is built upon to generate two strategies for capture of targets having a known speed bound that require searcher teams of much smaller size. The efficacy of these algorithms is demonstrated by evaluation in extensive simulation using realistic vehicle models across a spectrum of environment classes.",

It is motivated by a recent framework that combines sampling-based motion planning in the state space with discrete search over a workspace decomposition. Building on this line of work, the premise of this paper is that the computational efficiency can be significantly improved by tightly coupling sampling-based motion planning with probabilistic roadmap abstractions instead of workspace decompositions. Probabilistic roadmap abstractions are constructed over a low-dimensional configuration space obtained by considering relaxed and simplified representations of the robot model and its feasible motions. By capturing the connectivity of the free configuration space, roadmap abstractions provide the framework with promising suggestions of how to effectively expand the sampling-based search in the full state space. Experiments with high-dimensional robot models, nonlinear dynamics, and nonholonomic constraints show significant computational speedups over related work.",

        "abstract": "For a robot to act in the world, it needs to build and maintain a simple and concise model of that world, from which it can derive safe opportunities for action and hazards to avoid. Unfortunately, the world itself is infinitely complex, containing aspects (\u201cclutter\u201d) that are not well described, or even well approximated, by the simple model. An adequate explanatory model must therefore explicitly delineate the clutter that it does not attempt to explain. As the robot searches for the best model to explain its observations, it faces a three-way trade-off among the coverage of the model, the degree of accuracy with which the model explains the observations, and the simplicity of the model. We present a likelihood function that addresses this trade-off. We demonstrate and evaluate this likelihood function in the context of a mobile robot doing visual scene understanding. Our experimental results on a corpus of RGB-D videos of cluttered indoor environments demonstrate that this method is capable of creating a simple and concise planar model of the major structures (ground plane and walls) in the environment, while separating out for later analysis segments of clutter represented by 3D point clouds.",

        "abstract": "This work presents an approach for exploring unknown surfaces with discontinuities using only force/torque information. The motivation is to build an information map of an unknown object or environment by performing a fully-autonomous haptic exploration. Examples of discontinuities considered here are contours with sharp turns (such as wall corners) and abrupt dips (such as cliffs). Compliant motion control using force information has the ability to conform to unknown, smooth surfaces but not to discontinuous surfaces. This paper investigates solutions to address the limitation in compliant motion control over discontinuities while maintaining a desired normal force along the surface. We propose two methods to address the problem: (1) superposition of motion and force control and (2) rotation of axes for force and motion control. The theoretical principles are discussed and experimental results with a KUKA lightweight arm moving in 2D space are presented. Both approaches successfully negotiate objects with sharp 90-degree and 120-degree turns while still maintaining good tracking of the desired force.",

The intended application is live power line maintenance. With respect to this application, three main challenges are recognized in the field: need for the force feedback, wireless communication between master and slave sites, and base excitation of the slave manipulator. In this paper, a test rig is developed to examine how an operator's hand speed regulating scheme enhances the lineman's performance while the entire system works under a wireless communication channel and the slave base is under excitation. Two sets of experiments are performed when the haptic device produces no force and when the regulating haptic force is added to the master device. Performance of the system is evaluated by measuring four indices: operator's failure in completing a task, end-effector displacement, slave manipulator controller effort, and task completion time. Results indicate that adding the haptic force to the system helps linemen function more effectively when the system is subject to base-excitation and communicates through a wireless network.",

Towards this purpose, the number of joints, the angular range, speed and acceleration of the eyes and neck rotations should be should be in agreement with human psychophysics, i.e. reproducing realistic kinematics. We present a mechatronic system of the head and neck; accompanied by experimental results of head-fixed eye movements, solely head rotations, as well as eye-head cooperative motion for large angles of gaze shifting.

        "abstract": "In persistent missions, taking system's health and capability degradation into account is an essential factor to predict and avoid failures. The state space in health-aware planning problems is often a mixture of continuous vehicle-level and discrete mission-level states. This in particular poses a challenge when the mission domain is partially observable and restricts the use of computationally expensive forward search methods. This paper presents a method that exploits a structure that exists in many health-aware planning problems and performs a two-layer planning scheme. The lower layer exploits the local linearization and Gaussian distribution assumption over vehicle-level states while the higher layer maintains a non-Gaussian distribution over discrete mission-level variables. This two-layer planning scheme allows us to limit the expensive online forward search to the mission-level states, and thus predict system's behavior over longer horizons in the future. We demonstrate the performance of the method on a long duration package delivery mission using a quadrotor in a partially-observable domain in the presence of constraints and health/capability degradation.",

Originally as a paper craft from 17th century AD, origami designs reveal the rudimentary characteristics of sheet folding: it is lightweight, inexpensive, compact and combinatorial. In this paper, we present \u201cHexaMorph\u201d, a novel starfish-like hexapod robot designed for modularity, foldability and reconfigurability. Our folding scheme encompasses periodic foldable tetrahedral units, called \u201cBasic Structural Units\u201d (BSU), for constructing a family of closed-loop spatial mechanisms and robotic forms. The proposed hexapod robot is fabricated using single sheets of cardboard. The electronic and battery components for actuation are allowed to be preassembled on the flattened crease-cut pattern and enclosed inside when the tetrahedral modules are folded. The self-deploying characteristic and the mobility of the robot are investigated, and we discuss the motion planning and control strategies for its squirming locomotion. Our design and folding paradigm provides a novel approach for building reconfigurable robots using a range of lightweight foldable sheets.",

This work presents HiGen, a high-speed genderless mechanical connection mechanism for the docking of robotic modules. HiGen connectors can join with one another in a manner that allows either side to disconnect in the event of failure. During connection electrical contacts are mated, supporting the concurrent use of local and global communication protocols, as well as power sharing techniques. Rapid actuation of the mechanism allows connections to be made and broken at a speed that is, to our knowledge, an order of magnitude faster than existing mechanical genderless approaches that feature single-sided disconnect, benefiting the reconfiguration time of modular robots. The HiGen connector is intended for future work in modular robotics, but could also see use in other areas of robotics for tool and payload attachment.",

Fingertip Space is a representation that takes into account both the local geometry of object surface as well as the fingertip geometry. As such, it is directly applicable to the object point cloud data and it establishes a basis for the grasp search space. We propose a model for a hierarchical encoding of the Fingertip Space that enables multilevel refinement for efficient grasp synthesis.

        "abstract": "Catching is one of the most complex tasks in the area of dynamic manipulation. Exact information on the position and orientation of a rigid object is crucial in order to accomplish manipulation tasks. Both motion planner and control strategy use these data to achieve the desired contact of a predefined surface with a nonprehensile end-effector, e.g. flat plate. This paper presents a multi-level approach for robust task planning and execution for planar catching of rigid bodies. On the top level the choice of the best catching strategy is made. Different catching actions are introduced and classified based on relative translational and rotational velocities between the end-effector and the object. A motion planner is implemented on the middle level that produces smooth motion trajectories depending on the chosen strategy. Yet, some uncertainties occur during task execution due to sensory data, trajectory tracking and unmodeled dynamics. Therefore, a robust tracking control is implemented on the bottom level to guarantee task execution in presence of uncertainty in robot parameters. A sustainable framework is being used taking the dynamics of the robot, the object and the environment into account to create a consistent and versatile catching system.",

With an SI-traceable stiffness reference we estimate the accuracy of the RT-CFM to be 3.49%. The target locations are selected from an interactive image of the workspace, and the sensing tip is positioned at each location using visual servoing techniques. Topography and stiffness maps were successfully obtained on growing pollen tubes. With the proposed system, cells can be mechanically stimulated at high speeds and with high precision while the intracellular components are visualized using confocal imaging.

However, the unsteady nature of fluid-structure interactions during flapping wing flight render analytical design of wing shapes and motion kinematics difficult. We propose that flapping wing micro aerial vehicle (MAV) design will benefit from a complimentary, datadriven approach in which wing shape, material properties, and stroke-kinematics may be varied rapidly. Here, we present a high-throughput experimental apparatus for fabrication and optimization of MAV wings for flapping flight. This apparatus incorporates the collection and analysis of multiple sensor modalities including force, electrical power, resultant fluid flow, and wing kinematics into the experiment control loop. This \u201canalysis-in-the-loop\u201d methodology enables multivariate optimization routines for flapping flight of unmanned aerial vehicles. We demonstrate the validity of this approach through optimization experiments on wing kinematics, fluid flow, lift and power consumption.",

        "abstract": "Control design of running robots is often based on mapping the behavior of lower order models onto the robotic systems, and the robustness of running is largely determined by the robustness of these underlying models. However, existing implementations do not take full advantage of the stability that the low order models can provide. In particular, analysis of the theoretical spring mass model suggests leg placement policies that generate near deadbeat rejection of large, unobserved changes in ground height. Here we show in simulation that this blind robustness to rough terrain can be carried over to bipedal robots. We design a control that stably embeds the spring mass model's behavior in a planar robot model and show that resulting system rejects ground disturbances of up to 25% leg length, adapts to persistent ground slopes, and tolerates sensor noise, signal delays, and modeling errors. The results indicate that transferring control derived within the spring mass model is an effective technique for realizing highly robust running in robotic systems.",

        "abstract": "Bipedal locomotion can be divided into primitive tasks, namely repulsive leg behavior (bouncing against gravity), leg swing (protraction and retraction) and body alignment (balancing against gravity). In the bipedal spring-mass model for walking and running, the repulsive leg function is described by a linear prismatic spring. This paper adopts two strategies for swinging and bouncing control from conceptual models for the human-inspired musculoskeletal BioBiped robot. The control approach consists of two layers, velocity based leg adjustment (VBLA) and virtual model control to represent a virtual springy leg between toe and hip. Additionally, the rest length and stiffness of the virtual springy leg are tuned based on events to compensate energy losses due to damping. In order to mimic human locomotion, the trunk is held upright by physical constraints. The controller is implemented on the validated detailed simulation model of BioBiped. In-place as well as forward hopping and switching between these two gaits are easily achieved by tuning the parameters for the leg adjustment, virtual leg stiffness and injected energy. Furthermore, it is shown that the achieved motion performance of in-place hopping agrees well with that of human subjects.",

In particular, we show how these key properties can be traced back to the ideas of subsumption and sequential compositions of robot behaviors. Thus BTs can be seen as a recent addition to a long research effort towards increasing modularity, robustness and safety of robot control software.

        "abstract": "Controlling a swarm of robots after deployment is difficult, due to the unpredictable and emergent behavior of swarm algorithms. Past work has focused on influencing the swarm via statically selected leaders\u2014swarm members that the operator directly controls\u2014that are pre-selected and remain leaders throughout the scenario execution. This paper investigates the use of dynamically selected leaders that are directly controlled by the human operator to guide the rest of the swarm, which is operating under a flocking-style algorithm. The goal of the operator is to move the swarm to goal regions that arise dynamically in the environment. We experimentally investigated (a) the effect of density of leaders on the ease of human control and system performance, and (b) how restriction of information communicated to the human operator affects the ability to guide the swarm to goal regions. The density of leaders is computed based on an extension of the random competition clustering (RCC) algorithm used in wireless sensor networks to select cluster heads. In particular, we studied the effect of different guarantees of the maximum number of hops in the communication graph from any robot to the nearest leader. Increasing the maximum hop guarantee effectively lowers the density of leaders in the swarm. Our results show that, while there was a large drop in the number of goals reached when moving from a 1-hop to a 2-hop guarantee, the difference between a 2-hop and 3-hop guarantee was not statistically significant. Furthermore, we found that performance was just as good when the information returned to the operator was restricted, showing that operators can still navigate a swarm even when they have imperfect information.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a machine vision based approach for human operators to select individual and groups of autonomous robots from a swarm of UAVs. The angular distance between the robots and the human is estimated using measures of the detected human face, which aids to determine human and multi-UAV localization and positioning. In turn, this is exploited to effectively and naturally make the human select the spatially situated robots. Spatial gestures for selecting robots are presented by the human operator using tangible input devices (i.e., colored gloves). To select individuals and groups of robot we formulate a vocabulary of two-handed spatial pointing gestures. With the use of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained in a cascaded multi-binary-class configuration, the spatial gestures are effectively learned and recognized by a swarm of UAVs.",

        "abstract": "Whole arm manipulation (WAM) allows robotic manipulators to grasp or even manipulate bulky and heavy objects. The idea is that a robot basically wraps around a bulky object to grasp it. This furthermore allows to grasp relative heavy objects, since the center of gravity of the object is located more closely to the first joints of the robot. Whole arm manipulation significantly increases the manipulation skills of a robot and makes it more useful in human environment and was already applied to carry bulky and heavy objects [9], [10], or a human dummy [11]. In the past only few controllers dedicated for WAM were presented. In this paper we propose a new impedance controller on object level that considers the grasp of a bulky object with contacts on the (passive) robot chest and on each forearm of a two-armed robot system. This included to locate the object frame along with the passive contact frame, so that only object rotations need to be commanded. The controller was successfully implemented on DLR Justin. A gymnastic ball with a diameter of 0.45 m was securely grasped and the object was rotated in three dimensions.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a new optimization algorithm for networks of switched nonlinear objectives and apply this to the important problem of pose graph estimation for robot localization and mapping. The key insight is to replace the linear solver typically used in Gauss-Newton style methods with hybrid inference over switched discrete/continuous linear Gaussian networks. Since exact inference in these networks is known to be NP-hard, we also propose an approximate inference algorithm for the linearized hybrid networks based on message passing. We apply the new algorithm to the problem of robust pose graph estimation in the presence of incorrect loop closures and compare against three recently published approaches to the same problem. Evaluation is performed on ten sequences from two different datasets and shows that our approach performs substantially better than the state of the art.",

The model selected was based on a quadrotor-like aerial platform, adapted to dive and move underwater. Kinematic and dynamic models are presented here, and the parameters for a small dimension prototype was estimated and simulated. Finally, controllers were used and validated in realistic simulation, including air and water navigation, and the environment transition problem.

However, remote surgery has not been approved in any country, since patient safety cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, we present a hybrid control system for master-slave velocity control and admittance control for safe remote robotic surgery. The proposed controller switches between these two controls adaptively and stably and avoids excessive contact force between the robotic surgical instrument and the patient's organs. Through the proposed scheme, the contact force between the robotic instrument and objects at the slave site can be bounded by a set upper limit regardless of the motion the operator inputs at the master site. The performance of the proposed system was verified analytically. The proposed control scheme was implemented in a robotic surgical system and its performance was verified through simulations and experiments. The results of the simulations and experiments showed that the system autonomously switches stably between master-slave velocity control and admittance control and avoids excessive contact force.",

The particle filter is a prominent approach in the field of Robotics, due to its adaptability to non-linear models with multi-modal distributions. Nonetheless, its result is strongly dependent on the quality and the number of samples required to cover the space of possible solutions. In contrast, interval analysis deals with high-dimensionality problems by reducing the space enclosing the actual solution. Notwithstanding, it cannot precise where in the resulting subspace the actual solution is. We devised a strategy that combines the best of both worlds. Our approach is illustrated by solving the global localization problem for underwater robots.",

These tasks are addressed nowadays using manned submersibles or work-class remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), equipped with teleoperated arms under human supervision. In the context of the TRITON Spanish funded project, a subsea panel docking and an intervention procedure are proposed. The light-weight intervention AUV (I-AUV) Girona 500 is used to autonomously dock into a subsea panel using a funnel-based docking method for passive accommodation. Once docked, an autonomous fixed-based manipulation system, which uses feedback from a digital camera, is used to turn a valve and plug/unplug a connector. The paper presents the techniques used for the autonomous docking and manipulation as well as how the adapted subsea panel has been designed to facilitate such operations.",

Our study shows that current systems based only on inertial systems are not accurate enough to ensure the gangway is held in place without being secured mechanically. Using measurements from a 2D LIDAR system, we propose a method for the real-time monitoring of the position of the gangway in relation to the offshore wind turbine. Our algorithm involves detecting and estimating the position of the wind turbine pile in a 2D scatter diagram using robust approaches. To evaluate our method, we have installed a real-time 3D simulation chain fed with data from actual measurements. We obtain a measurement accuracy of the order of a centimeter, in real time, in representative sea state scenarios.",

For that purpose, safety of operation is important. Although a simulator is used for confirming safe conditions of operation, an error may arise in a dynamic parameter by the robot of a simulator, and an actual robot. In this paper, it identified about the viscoelasticity of the sole bush for impact absorption at the time of the walk of humanoid robot HRP-2. We used some simple active motions and composed these motions. We identified parameter using composed motions. We finally compare the identified parameters using the experimental results and simulator results.",

We drive a person's hand with a robot along smooth reaching trajectories while measuring the motion of the shoulder and elbow joints and the force required to move the hand. We fit a model that predicts the shoulder and elbow joint torques required to achieve a desired arm motion. This torque can be supplied by functional electrical stimulation of muscles to control the arm of a person paralyzed by spinal cord injury. Errors in predictions of the joint torques for a subject without spinal cord injury were less than 20% of the maximum torques observed in the identification experiments. In most cases a semiparametric Gaussian process model predicted joint torques with equal or less error than a nonparametric Gaussian process model or a parametric model.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Image based visual servoing (IBVS) has become increasingly common in automated systems. IBVS control systems are dependent on the accuracy of an image Jacobian, which requires the knowledge of the internal and external parameters of the system. In most systems, some or all of these parameters are unknown. A centralized motion algorithm (CMA) is proposed to compute the image Jacobian with fast convergence and low iterations. Centralized motion is defined as a motion where a single feature point does not change its pixel coordinate value through the camera's motion. Therefore, the CMA is an algorithm that exploits the fact that the chosen feature point will have little to no changes in pixel coordinates. As a result, the CMA requires only a single stationary feature point, along with a minimum of two more feature points that will be dynamic, in the image to compute the image Jacobian. Using a Whole-Arm Manipulation (WAM) IBVS system, it was shown that an image Jacobian with an average condition number of 45, converges in an average of 4 iterations from 6 different starting positions. Experiments show that the CMA is a fast and effective online calibration algorithm.",

This paper proposes a new controller for this class of aerial robotic systems that allows regulating on velocity commands generated by an outer image-based visual-servo scheme. The controller, that considers the full dynamics of the system, is designed based on the integral backstepping approach. Visual feedback provided by an onboard camera is employed into a new visual servo scheme to simultaneously generate velocity commands for the UAV and the manipulator so that a visual target is reached. The control system takes into account the under-actuation related to rotary-wing vehicles, while at the same time it exploits the functionality system redundancy to achieve the task. Simulation results validate the proposed control system, as well as its robustness to large modeling error and measurement noise.",

Our control law defines the trajectory of the robotic arm towards a previously unknown handover location based on the Dynamic Movement Primitives formalism adapted for human robot object handover. The control law was deployed on a Kuka Light-Weight Arm equipped with the Azzurra anthropomorphic hand. We employed an industrial-like setting involving three different human postures for object handover in order to evaluate the performance and user experience of our control law and its generalizability. The evaluation was conducted over 1000 object handover trials between the human and robot partners, and the kinematic data and subjective experience were gathered for each trial. The outcomes of this evaluation validate the current implementation and guide the next steps towards more efficient and fluid human robot interaction.",

Since the previously reported method has a high computational cost, we proposed a sound source detection algorithm called MUltiple SIgnal Classification based on incremental Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (iGSVD-MUSIC), which detects sound source location and temporal activity with low computational cost. In addition, to relax an over-esitimation problem of noise correlation matrix which is used in iGSVD-MUSIC, we proposed Correlation Matrix Scaling (CMS), which realizes soft whitening of noise. The protptype system based on the proposed methods were evaluated with two types of microphone arrays in an outdoor environment. Experimental results showed that the combination of iGSVD-MUSIC and CMS improves sound source detection performance drastically and achieves real-time processing.",

        "abstract": "A data ferry enables communication in sparse sensor networks by combining physical movement with wireless relaying of data. Optimizing an unmanned aircraft's motion and communication link scheduling, however, requires knowledge of the communication environments through which it moves. Aspects of the radio frequency environment can be opportunistically learned through the process of communicating with sensor nodes while ferrying, allowing models of the radio environment to be improved. This work analyzes the integration of ferry optimization with using a Gaussian process to learn the radio environment. The unmanned aircraft's trajectory is initially optimized with an a priori model. After flying one period of the trajectory, RF variations observed by the ferry are used to train a Gaussian process and improve the estimate of the environment. Through this iterative process, ferry performance improves rapidly, achieving 80% of optimal within 4 iterations, and 93% after 9 iterations, as the Gaussian process is able to converge rapidly to the true radio frequency environment.",

        "abstract": "Tracking the position of moving objects requires tight coordination of sensing and movement, in both biological contexts such as prey pursuit and capture, and in target localization by mobile robots. Algorithms for target tracking often use a probabilistic map, or information map, of the domain to guide active search. Though it is reasonable to expect that the best approach would be to choose control actions driving the robot toward the maximum of this information map, we show improved performance in simulation by using a simple heuristic incorporating the time history of robot movement into the map. Furthermore, our results indicate that as the distribution of robot positions approaches the distribution of the density of information, the variance of the estimate is decreased and tracking improves. We conclude that control actions based solely on information maximization may under-perform in information orientated tasks, such as the estimation of moving target positions.",

        "abstract": "An industrial robot's workflow typically consists of a set of tasks that have to be repeated multiple times. A task could be, for example, welding a seam or cutting a hole. The efficiency with which the robot performs the sequence of tasks is an important factor in most production domains. In most practical scenarios, the majority of tasks have a certain freedom of execution. For example, closed-contour welding task can often be started and finished at any point of the curve. In this paper we propose a method that is able to automatically improve the given sequence of robotic tasks that allow for a certain freedom in (i) the position of the starting point along the curve, (ii) the orientation of the end-effector and (iii) the robot configuration. The proposed approach does not depend on the production domain and could be combined with any algorithm for constructing the initial task sequence.We evaluate the algorithm on a realistic case study and show that it could significantly improve the production time on the test instances from the cutting-deburring domain.",

The robot is a prototype for inspection applications aboard the International Space Station (ISS) both inside and outside the station. A specific area of interest for this paper is a narrow gap, approximately 1.5 inches wide, behind internal equipment racks. The prototype robot uses oppositional pairs of gecko adhesive pads that turn the van der Waals adhesion ON and OFF using an applied shear load. The robot is currently teleoperated and utilizes an inchworm style gait. The robot can turn in a tight circle, fits within a 1.5 inch gap, and can transition between orthogonal surfaces. The gecko adhesives leave no residue, are highly reusable, and create strong adhesion in vacuum and across a wide temperature range. The robot design and initial experimental results are presented including climbing vertical walls in Earth's gravity.",

The design consists of a planar, vision-based micro force sensor end-effector, while the microrobot body is made from a nickel magnetic layer driven by an exterior magnetic field. With a known stiffness, the manipulation forces can be determined from observing the deformation of the end-effector through a CCD camera attached to an optical microscope. After analyzing and calibrating the stiffness of a micromachined prototype, manipulation tests are conducted to verify this microrobot prototype is indeed capable of in situ force sensing while performing a manipulation task. This concept can be scaled down further for next generation designs targeting real biomedical applications on microscale.",

Using simple machines and exploiting their mechanical advantage can significantly increase the breadth of a robot's capabilities. In this work, we present an autonomous planner which allows a robot to determine how arbitrary rigid objects in its environment can be utilized in machine designs to overcome physical challenges. First, the designed structure must be sufficient to achieve a task given the input force and torque that can be applied by the robot. Second, the structure must be accessible to the robot given its kinematics and geometry so that it can actually be used to perform the task. The output of our algorithm is the configuration of the design components, the pose of the robot to make contact with the design, and the motor torques needed to actuate it. We demonstrate results with the robot Golem Krang, using levers as simple machines, to overturn 100 kg load and to push 240 kg wheeled obstacle.",

        "abstract": "The process parameters of high precision robotic assembly have to be tuned in order to deal with part variations and system uncertainties. Some methods such as design-of-experiment, artificial neural network and genetic algorithms have been proposed to optimize these parameters offline. However, these parameters have to be retuned for different batches due to part variations, which increases the production cost and lowers the manufacturing efficiency. Therefore new methods have to be developed to solve the problem. Because of the complexity of high precision assembly process, it is challenging to build a physical model to establish the relationship between an assembly process and its process parameters. Therefore we propose an assembly process modeling method based on support vector regression that constructs a model by observing the relationship between the assembly parameters and assembly output. The effectiveness and accuracy of the support vector regression based algorithm are further demonstrated by experiments using a robotic valve body assembly process in automotive manufacturing. The results show that the proposed method is capable of modeling complex assembly processes.",

Inspecting vertical structures, such as light and power distribution poles, is a time consuming, dangerous and expensive task with high operator workload. To address these issues, we propose a VTOL platform that can operate at close-quarters, whilst maintaining a safe stand-off distance and rejecting environmental disturbances. We adopt an Image based Visual Servoing (IBVS) technique using only two line features to stabilise the vehicle with respect to a pole. Visual, inertial and sonar data are used, making the approach suitable for indoor or GPS-denied environments. Results from simulation and outdoor flight experiments demonstrate the system is able to successfully inspect and circumnavigate a pole.",

The proposed controller consists of two parts of a primary algorithm, which are ellipsoid regression method for re-designing trajectory and impedance controller with pseudo mass/inertia. The ellipsoid regression method generates reference impedance profiles though acquiring motion and force trajectories during rehabilitation tasks assisted by therapists. The assisted force is controlled by impedance controller during execution of rehabilitation task using a concept of pseudo mass/inertia. The proposed method offers the power-assisted rehabilitation as guided by therapist, without consistent help from the therapist or other assisters. The proposed control method is validated by experiments throughout a 2-DOF rehabilitation robot, KULEX-2DOF(KIST Upper Limb Exoskeleton - 2DOF).",

        "abstract": "Sampling-based algorithms are a common approach to high-dimensional real-world path planning problems. Unfortunately the solutions found using such planners are often not practical in that they do not take into account soft application-specific constraints. This paper formulates the practicality of paths based on the notion of soft constraints found in the Planning Domain Definition Language 3 (PDDL3) [21] and a range of optimization strategies are developed targeted towards user-preferred qualities by integrating soft constraints in the pre-processing, planning and post-processing phases of the sampling-based path planners. An auction-based resource allocation approach coordinates competing optimization strategies. This approach uses an adaptive bidding strategy for each optimizer and in each round the optimizer with the best predicted performance is selected. This general coordination system allows for flexibility in both the number and types of the optimizers used. Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a simple way to formulate geometric contact formation to have an arbitrary intersection shape in a robotic (humanoid) posture generation problem. The contact shape is the outcome of our posture generator that is formulated as a non-linear optimization programming to fulfill a large variety of robot intrinsic limitations (e.g. joint and torque limits) and tasks (e.g. desired contact). Starting by defining convex areas of contact on the robot's body and the environment, that we call contact patches, we can generate contacts with arbitrary intersection of a pair of any of these predefined patches. Our geometric contact modeling writes very simply as additional constraints and variables added to the optimization problem, translating the search for an ellipse inscribed in the intersection of the pair of patches we want in contact. The result of our posture generator is then a configuration where contact patches are not necessarily included in one another. This allows our posture generator to propose contacts of different shapes with a non-predefined number of contact points (used later to compute reaction/contact forces). We illustrate the efficiency of our method in multi-contact posture generation with the HRP-2 and ATLAS humanoid robots with results that can not be generated automatically by existing methods.",

        "abstract": "In the field of intelligent robotics, object handling by robots can be achieved by capturing not only the object concept through object categorization, but also other concepts (e.g., the movement while using the object), as well as the relationship between concepts. Moreover, capturing the concepts of places and people is also necessary to enable the robot to gain real-world understanding. In this study, we propose multi-layered multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation (mMLDA) to realize the formation of various concepts, and the integration of those concepts, by robots. Because concept formation and integration can be conducted by mMLDA, the formation of each concept affects others, resulting in a more appropriate formation. Another issue to be addressed in this paper is the language acquisition by the robots. We propose a method to infer which words are originally connected to a concept using mutual information between words and concepts. Moreover, the order of concepts in teaching utterances can be learned using a simple Markov model, which corresponds to grammar. This grammar can be used to generate sentences that represent the observed information. We report the results of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "On rough terrain, there are a variety of soil types having different soil strength. It means that it is needed to change wheel control strategies since optimal wheel slip levels differ depending on soil strength. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel algorithm for optimal slip control of wheeled robots with a trade-off between traction and energy consumption on the basis of observing a change of a robot velocity on a variety of soil types. Proposed intelligent slip-optimization control algorithm is largely divided into three main parts; (1) slip optimization (2) slip controller (3) intelligent disturbance compensator. For slip optimization, an optimal slip model is derived as a function of slip ratios regarding maximum traction and tractive efficiency from indoor experimental data during a wheel-terrain interaction. Optimized slip ratio is used as an input of a PID slip controller with compensation of disturbance which occurs by a change of surface shapes. This algorithm is verified by controlling a real four wheeled robot on rough terrains.",

        "abstract": "Once a multi-robot system is implemented on real hardware and tested in the real world, analyzing its evolution and debugging unexpected behaviors is often a very difficult task. We present a tool for aiding this activity, by visualizing an Augmented Reality overlay on a live video feed acquired by a fixed camera overlooking the robot environment. Such overlay displays live information exposed by each robot, which may be textual (state messages), symbolic (graphs, charts), or, most importantly, spatially-situated; spatially-situated information is related to the environment surrounding the robot itself, such as for example the perceived position of neighboring robots, the perceived extent of obstacles, the path the robot plans to follow. We show that, by directly representing such information on the environment it refers to, our proposal removes a layer of indirection and significantly eases the process of understanding complex multi-robot systems. We describe how the system is implemented, discuss application examples in different scenarios, and provide supplementary material including demonstration videos and a functional implementation.",

        "abstract": "Humans are more successful in planning collision free, continuous trajectories through populated environments than any motion planning algorithm so far. This is due to the fact that they consider the conditionally cooperative, interactive behavior of the surrounding persons, for example the possibility of mutual avoidance maneuvers. In this paper, interaction during navigation is regarded from a game theoretic perspective and the concept of Nash equilibria is applied to analyze human motion. In contrast to other methods, the game theoretic approach does not necessarily rely on learning the interaction itself and is extendable. Our approach is based on human motion data that is captured during experiments. Two hypotheses are verified: for one thing, interaction exists during human navigation, for another thing, the mutual avoidance behavior of humans can be modeled with the theory of Nash equilibria in non-cooperative games. This knowledge can be used to enhance existing motion planning algorithms for autonomous robots.",

        "abstract": "In order for manufacturing companies to remain competitive while also offering a high degree of customization for the customers, flexible robots that can be rapidly reprogrammed to new tasks need to be applied in the factories. In this paper we propose a method for the intuitive programming of an industrial mobile robot by combining robot skills, a graphical user interface and human gesture recognition. We give a brief introduction to robot skills as we envision them for intuitive programming, and how they are used in the robot system. We then describe the tracking and gesture recognition, and how the instructor uses the method for programming. We have verified our approach through experiments on several subjects, showing that the system is generally easy to use even for inexperienced users. Furthermore, the programming time required to program a new task is very short, especially keeping traditional industrial robot programming methods in mind.",

        "abstract": "For mobile robots which operate in human populated environments, modeling social interactions is key to understand and reproduce people's behavior. A promising approach to this end is Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) as it allows to model the factors that motivate people's actions instead of the actions themselves. A crucial design choice in IRL is the selection of features that encode the agent's context. In related work, features are typically chosen ad hoc without systematic evaluation of the alternatives and their actual impact on the robot's task. In this paper, we introduce a new software framework to systematically investigate the effect features and learning algorithms used in the literature. We also present results for the task of socially compliant robot navigation in crowds, evaluating two different IRL approaches and several feature sets in large-scale simulations. The results are benchmarked according to a proposed set of objective and subjective performance metrics.",

Here, we use a remote interaction setting to investigate possible effects of simulated versus real first-person robot video feeds. The first experiment uses subject-level comparisons of the two video conditions in a multi-robot setting while the second and third experiments focus on a single robot, single video condition using a larger population (via Amazon Mechanical Turk) to study between-subjects effects. The latter experiments also probe the effects of robot appearance, video feed type, and stake humans have in the task. We observe a complex interplay between interaction, robot appearance, and video feed type as they affect perceived collaboration, utility, competence, and warmth of the robot.",

        "abstract": "The etymology of the word \u201cAnthropos\u201d, the Greek word for Human, includes one of the defining characteristics of human beings, which is the ability to stand upright and walk. Locomotion is one of the human's most important functions that serve survival, progress and interaction. The force stimulus generated by the interaction of the foot with the walking surface is a vital part of human gait. Although there have been many studies trying to decipher the load feedback mechanisms of gait, there is a need for the development of a versatile system that can advance research and provide new functionality. Moreover, the role of the load feedback in inter-leg coordination during walking is still not well understood. In this paper, we present a series of studies that attempt to shed light on the role of load feedback on inter-leg coordination using a novel system, called Variable Stiffness Treadmill (VST). The device is capable of controlling load feedback stimulus by regulating the walking surface stiffness in real time. We first present the main functionality of the VST, focusing on the real-time closed-loop control of stiffness. Using perturbations of the treadmill stiffness on one leg of healthy subjects, we investigate the inter-leg coordination mechanisms, in body-weight-supported gait. Results show that ipsilateral stiffness perturbations, affect the contralateral (unperturbed) leg in body-weight-supported gait, while their effect is dependent on the timing of the induced stiffness perturbations. The developed system and experimental protocols are uniquely useful for gait research, can improve our understanding of gait, and create new avenues of research on gait analysis, walking robots and gait rehabilitation.",

In order to deal with this issue, a control architecture is proposed to dissipate the extra energy of the system and guarantee its stability and safety of the patient. For this purpose, (a) first, a multilayer adaptive filter is proposed to estimate high-frequency components of hand motions (corresponding to involuntary movements); (b) then a resistive force field is generated and applied by the robot to attenuate the tremor; and (c) simultaneously the residual low-frequency voluntary actions are amplified/coordinated to deliver appropriate therapy. Stability analysis and a stabilization scheme are developed to guarantee safe interaction regardless of variations in the patient's dynamics and tremor kinematics. The ultimate goal is to make it possible for patients with pathological tremors to take advantage of non-passive robotic assistive/coordinative therapy. This would not be possible using conventional systems due to the possibility of tremor amplification. Experimental results are presented.",

        "abstract": "Multi-DoFs (Degrees of Freedom) manipulators with more than 6-DoF can perform complex and diverse tasks. To make these serial-chain manipulators safer, a variety of safety components were researched. If there is a crash at the end-effector of the serial-chain manipulators, components mounted on joints of the upper and lower arm can absorb the impact. Unfortunately, physical human-robot interaction does not occur only at the end-effector, a collision can happen anywhere from the base to the end-effector. If a collision occurs in the upper arm of relatively low DoFs, safety components attached to each joint may not work properly. Therefore, a study for joint configurations of serial manipulators is necessary with respect to the placement of safety components at the shoulder joint. Through various case studies, this paper verifies the appropriate joint configurations that place safety components at each revolute joint for physical human-robot safety.",

In order to control the robot manipulator with unknown effects, a time-delay control(TDC) method that eliminates the nonlinear effects is used to control the joint torque servo. Although the TDC is very adaptive in nonlinear systems, there is limitation of the TDC in a high friction robot manipulator; hence, a friction model is considered. A collision detecting method is proposed to secure safety for human and robot-interacting environment. Using the torque sensor attached at the joints of the robot arm, the collision is detected more effectively. After detecting collision, a safety reaction method is applied. A torque sensor based 3-joints robot arm is used to verify the performance of the proposed methods.",

We present a robust solution for cluttered indoor environments, using an inexpensive RGB-D sensor such as the Microsoft Kinect or Asus Xtion. Even in challenging scenarios with multiple people in view at once and occluding each other, our system solves the person detection problem significantly better than alternative approaches, reaching a precision, recall and F1-score of 0.85, 0.81 and 0.83, respectively.

        "abstract": "An exoskeleton design for a rhesus macaque subject is motivated, presented, and analyzed. As kinematic properties of the macaque's upper-limb have not been thoroughly studied, this paper introduces methods to determine properties relevant to exoskeleton design. Alignment with biological joints is critical for exoskeleton performance, but there are no accepted kinematic joint models for rhesus macaques. An algorithm is introduced which uses motion capture data to determine an appropriate model for the shoulder complex. An exoskeleton which incorporates this model is introduced, then analyzed. As joint speeds of macaques are also not well studied, a proposed analysis finds an upper bound on the joint speeds required to realize a given end effector speed in an arbitrary direction for all configurations within the workspace.",

        "abstract": "Predicting the motions of rigid objects under contacts is a necessary precursor to planning of robot manipulation of objects. On the one hand physics based rigid body simulations are used, and on the other learning approaches are being developed. The advantage of physics simulations is that because they explicitly perform collision checking they respect kinematic constraints, producing physically plausible predictions. The advantage of learning approaches is that they can capture the effects on motion of unobservable parameters such as mass distribution, and frictional coefficients, thus producing more accurate predicted trajectories. This paper shows how to bring together the advantages of both approaches to achieve learned simulators of specific objects that outperform previous learning approaches. Our approach employs a fast simplified collision checker and a learning method. The learner predicts trajectories for the object. These are optimised post prediction to minimise interpenetrations according to the collision checker. In addition we show that cleaning the training data prior to learning can also improve performance. Combining both approaches results in consistently strong prediction performance. The new simulator outperforms previous learning based approaches on a single contact push manipulation prediction task. We also present results showing that the method works for multi-contact manipulation, for which rigid body simulators are notoriously unstable.",

        "abstract": "The growing interest in robots that interact safely with humans and surroundings have prompted the need for soft structural embodiments including soft actuators. This paper explores a class of soft actuators inspired in design and construction by Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (PAMs) or McKibben Actuators. These bio-inspired actuators consist of fluid-filled elastomeric enclosures that are reinforced with fibers along a specified orientation and are in general referred to as Fiber-Reinforced Elastomeric Enclosures (FREEs). Several recent efforts have mapped the fiber configurations to instantaneous deformation, forces, and moments generated by these actuators upon pressurization with fluid. However most of the actuators, when deployed undergo large deformations and large overall motions thus necessitating the study of their large-deformation kinematics. This paper analyzes the large deformation kinematics of FREEs. A concept called configuration memory effect is proposed to explain the smart nature of these actuators. This behavior is tested with experiments and finite element modeling for a small sample of actuators. The paper also describes different possibilities and design implications of the large deformation behavior of FREEs in successful creation of soft robots.",

In past work, we examined kinetostatic optimization of candidate articulated leg-wheel subsystem designs (based on the four-bar mechanism) for enhancing locomotion capabilities of land-based vehicles. Our goal was to: (i) achieve the greatest motion-ranges between wheel axle and chassis while (ii) reducing the overall actuation requirements by spring assist. In the current work, we examine the possibility of enhancing this terrain-accommodation by: (i) proposing an \u201cadjustable four-bar\u201d articulated-leg-wheel subsystem; (ii) with active-structural control to actively change subsystem parameters during the terrain traversal. Multiple leg-wheel design- parameters can affect the peak-static torque requirements as well as dynamic-bandwidth requirements for the leg-wheel actuation. The presented results compare and contrast online-structural reconfiguration planning (with multiple alternate active-adjustments) to reduce actuation requirements for a predetermined/sensed terrain traversal profile.",

        "abstract": "This paper tackles the problem of designing an effective user interface for a multi-robot delivery system, composed of robots with wheeled bases and two 3 DOF arms. There are several proven paradigms for increasing the efficacy of human-robot interaction: 1) multimodal interfaces in which the user controls the robots using voice and gesture; 2) configurable interfaces which allow the user to create new commands by demonstrating them; 3) adaptive interfaces which reduce the operator's workload as necessary through increasing robot autonomy. Here we study the relative benefits of configurable vs. adaptive interfaces for multi-robot manipulation. User expertise was measured along three axes (navigation, manipulation, and coordination), and users who performed above threshold on two out of three dimensions on a calibration task were rated as expert. Our experiments reveal that the relative expertise of the user was the key determinant of the best performing interface paradigm for that user, indicating that good user modeling is essential for designing a human-robot interaction system meant to be used for an extended period of time.",

        "abstract": "Learning to predict the effects of actions applied to pairs of objects is a difficult task that requires learning complex relations with sparse, incomplete and noisy information. Our Knowledge Propagation approach propagates affordance predictions by exploiting similarities among object properties, action parameters and resulting effects. The knowledge is propagated in a graph where a missing edge, corresponding to an unknown interaction between two objects (nodes), is predicted via the superposition of all paths connecting those objects in the graph. The high complexity of affordance representation is addressed through the use of Maximum Margin Multi-Valued Regression (MMMVR), which scales well to complex problems of multiple layers. With increased diversity and size of object databases and the addition of other parametric combinatory actions, we expect to achieve complex systems that leverage learned structure for subsequent learning, achieving structural bootstrapping over lifelong development and learning. In this paper, we extend MMMVR for learning of paired-object affordances, i.e., for predicting the effects of actions applied to pairs of objects. In our experiments, we evaluated this method on a dataset composed of 83 objects and 83\u00d783 interactions. We compared the prediction performance with standard classifiers that predict the effect category given the object pair's low-level features or single-object affordances. The experiments show that our proposed method achieves significantly higher prediction performance especially when supported with Active Learning.",

We present Learning from Demonstration by Averaging Trajectories (LAT) which is a new, simple and computationally fast method and provide an implementation on a service robot. We compare LAT theoretically as well as empirically to LfD with Gaussian processes (GP) and to LfD with dynamic movement primitives (DMP). It turns out that LAT is as powerful as Gaussian processes, computationally faster than ordinary GPs and comparable to local GPs. The comparison of LAT to DMPs shows that LAT is able to detect constraints and thus can learn abstract concepts which DMPs can not. DMPs on the other hand can dynamically react to changing object positions which LAT and GPs can not. This gives rise for future work on a combination of LAT and DMPs.",

        "abstract": "The recognition of places that have already been visited is a fundamental requirement for a mobile robot. This particularly concerns the detection of loop closures while mapping environments as well as the global localization w.r.t. to a prior map. This paper introduces a novel solution to place recognition with 2D LIDAR scans. Existing approaches utilize descriptors covering the local appearance of discriminative features within a bag-of-words (BOW) framework accompanied with approximate geometric verification. Though limiting the set of potential matches their performance crucially drops for increasing number of scans making them less appropriate for large scale environments. We present Geometrical Landmark Relations (GLARE), which transform 2D laser scans into pose invariant histogram representations. Potential matches are found in sub-linear time using an efficient Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search. Experimental results obtained from publicly available datasets demonstrate that GLARE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in place recognition for large scale outdoor environments, while achieving similar results for indoor settings. Our Approach achieves recognition rates of 93% recall at 99% precision for a dataset covering a total path of about 6.5 km.",

Such application areas can benefit significantly from a recent focus on robust methods for graph-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). This paper focuses on two contributions: An approach to combine registration results from multiple methods in multimodal constraints and, up to the authors' knowledge, the first method to generate hyperedge constraints from state-of-the-art place recognition techniques. Both contributions are implemented within the Generalized Graph SLAM framework. Experimental results show that the methods generate informative constraints and that the authors' Prefilter method outperforms related methods on a large underwater image dataset processed with these methods.",

        "abstract": "Learning motor skills for robots is a hard task. In particular, a high number of degrees-of-freedom in the robot can pose serious challenges to existing reinforcement learning methods, since it leads to a high-dimensional search space. However, complex robots are often intrinsically redundant systems and, therefore, can be controlled using a latent manifold of much smaller dimensionality. In this paper, we present a novel policy search method that performs efficient reinforcement learning by uncovering the low-dimensional latent space of actuator redundancies. In contrast to previous attempts at combining reinforcement learning and dimensionality reduction, our approach does not perform dimensionality reduction as a preprocessing step but naturally combines it with policy search. Our evaluations show that the new approach outperforms existing algorithms for learning motor skills with high-dimensional robots.",

        "abstract": "Many navigation systems, including the ubiquitous ROS navigation stack, perform path-planning on a single costmap, in which the majority of information is stored in a single grid. This approach is quite successful at generating collision-free paths of minimal length, but it can struggle in dynamic, people-filled environments when the values in the costmap expand beyond occupied or free space. We have created and implemented a new method called layered costmaps, which work by separating the processing of costmap data into semantically-separated layers. Each layer tracks one type of obstacle or constraint, and then modifies a master costmap which is used for the path planning. We show how the algorithm can be integrated with the open-source ROS navigation stack, and how our approach is easier to fine-tune to specific environmental contexts than the existing monolithic one. Our design also results in faster path planning in practical use, and exhibits a cleaner separation of concerns that the original architecture. The new algorithm also makes it possible to represent complex cost values in order to create navigation behavior for a wide range of contexts.",

In this work, our goal is to model and learn the physical properties of such objects. We design actions involving use of tools such as forks and knives that obtain haptic data containing information about the physical properties of the object. We then design appropriate features and use supervised learning to map these features to certain physical properties (hardness, plasticity, elasticity, tensile strength, brittleness, adhesiveness). Additionally, we present a method to compactly represent the robot's beliefs about the object's properties using a generative model, which we use to plan appropriate manipulation actions. We extensively evaluate our approach on a dataset including haptic data from 12 categories of food (including categories not seen before by the robot) obtained in 941 experiments. Our robot prepared a salad during 60 sequential robotic experiments where it made a mistake in only 4 instances.",

        "abstract": "Learning motion control as a unified process of designing the reference trajectory and the controller is one of the most challenging problems in robotics. The complexity of the problem prevents most of the existing optimization algorithms from giving satisfactory results. While model-based algorithms like iterative linear-quadratic-Gaussian (iLQG) can be used to design a suitable controller for the motion control, their performance is strongly limited by the model accuracy. An inaccurate model may lead to degraded performance of the controller on the physical system. Although using machine learning approaches to learn the motion control on real systems have been proven to be effective, their performance depends on good initialization. To address these issues, this paper introduces a two-step algorithm which combines the proven performance of a model-based controller with a model-free method for compensating for model inaccuracy. The first step optimizes the problem using iLQG. Then, in the second step this controller is used to initialize the policy for our PI2-01 reinforcement learning algorithm. This algorithm is a derivation of the PI2 algorithm enabling more stable and faster convergence. The performance of this method is demonstrated both in simulation and experimental results.",

Such a change of grasp configuration is called grasp adaptation and it depends on the controller, the employed sensory feedback and the type of uncertainties inherit to the problem. This paper proposes a grasp adaptation strategy to deal with uncertainties about physical properties of objects, such as the object weight and the friction at the contact points. Based on an object-level impedance controller, a grasp stability estimator is first learned in the object frame. Once a grasp is predicted to be unstable by the stability estimator, a grasp adaptation strategy is triggered according to the similarity between the new grasp and the training examples. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves the grasping performance on novel objects with different physical properties from those used for training.",

Previous work has shown how statistical relational learning can be used in a discrete setting to extend affordances to model relations and interactions between multiple objects being manipulated by a robotic arm and deal with environment uncertainty. In this paper, we first extend this concept of relational affordances to a continuous setting and then to a two-arm robot. A relational affordance model can first be learnt for one arm through a behavioural babbling stage, and then with the use of statistical relational learning, after constructing a symmetrical model for the other arm, two-arm manipulation actions can be modelled, where the arms can act sequentially or simultaneously. The model is evaluated in a two-arm action recognition task in a shelf object manipulation setting.",

        "abstract": "Tactile sensing is a fundamental component of object manipulation and tool handling skills. With robots entering unstructured environments, tactile feedback also becomes an important ability for robot manipulation. In this work, we explore how a robot can learn to use tactile sensing in object manipulation tasks. We first address the problem of in-hand object localization and adapt three pose estimation algorithms from computer vision. Second, we employ dynamic motor primitives to learn robot movements from human demonstrations and record desired tactile signal trajectories. Then, we add tactile feedback to the control loop and apply relative entropy policy search to learn the parameters of the tactile coupling. Additionally, we show how the learning of tactile feedback can be performed more efficiently by reducing the dimensionality of the tactile information through spectral clustering and principal component analysis. Our approach is implemented on a real robot, which learns to perform a scraping task with a spatula in an altered environment.",

        "abstract": "In order to manage complex tasks such as cooking, future robots need to be action-aware and posses common sense knowledge. For example flipping a pancake requires a robot to know that a spatula has to be under a pancake in order to succeed. We present a novel approach for the extraction and learning of action and common sense knowledge, and developed a game using a robot-simulator with realistic physics for data acquisition. The game environment is a virtual kitchen, in which a user has to create a pancake by pouring pancake-mix on an oven and flipping it using a spatula. The interaction is done by controlling a virtual robot hand with a 3D input sensor. We incorporate a realistic fluid simulation in order to gather appropriate data of the pouring action. Furthermore, we present a task outcome prediction algorithm for this specific system and show how to learn a failure model for the pouring and flipping action.",

        "abstract": "Often in highly-cluttered environments, a robot can observe the exterior of the environment with ease, but cannot directly view nor easily infer its detailed internal structure (e.g., dense foliage or a full refrigerator shelf). We present a data-driven approach that greatly improves a robot's success at reaching to a goal location in the unknown interior of an environment based on observable external properties, such as the category of the clutter and the locations of openings into the clutter (i.e., apertures). We focus on the problem of selecting a good initial configuration for a manipulator when reaching with a greedy controller. We use density estimation to model the probability of a successful reach given an initial condition and then perform constrained optimization to find an initial condition with the highest estimated probability of success. We evaluate our approach with two simulated robots reaching in clutter, and provide a demonstration with a real PR2 robot reaching to locations through random apertures. In our evaluations, our approach significantly outperformed two alternative approaches when making two consecutive reach attempts to goals in distinct categories of unknown clutter. Our approach only uses sparse readily-apparent features.",

        "abstract": "In many robotic applications, especially long-term outdoor deployments, the success or failure of feature-based image registration is largely determined by changes in lighting. This paper reports on a method to learn visual feature point descriptors that are more robust to changes in scene lighting than standard hand-designed features. We demonstrate that, by tracking feature points in time-lapse videos, one can easily generate training data that captures how the visual appearance of interest points changes with lighting over time. This training data is used to learn feature descriptors that map the image patches associated with feature points to a lower-dimensional feature space where Euclidean distance provides good discrimination between matching and non-matching image patches. Results showing that the learned descriptors increase the ability to register images under varying lighting conditions are presented for a challenging indoor-outdoor dataset spanning 27 mapping sessions over a period of 15 months, containing a wide variety of lighting changes.",

        "abstract": "We present two fast and memory-efficient approximate estimation methods, targeting obstacle avoidance applications on small robot platforms. Our methods avoid a main bottleneck of traditional filtering techniques, which creates densely correlated cliques of landmarks, leading to expensive time and space complexity. We introduce a novel technique to avoid the dense cliques by sparsifying them into a tree structure and maintain that tree structure efficiently over time. Unlike other edge removal graph sparsification methods, our methods sparsify the landmark cliques by introducing new variables to de-correlate them. The first method projects the current density onto a tree rooted at the same variable at each step. The second method improves upon the first one by carefully choosing a new low-dimensional root variable at each step to replace such that the independence and conditional densities of the landmarks given the trajectory are optimally preserved. Our experiments show a significant improvement in time and space complexity of the methods compared to other standard filtering techniques in worst-case scenarios, with small trade-offs in accuracy due to low-rank approximation errors.",

        "abstract": "Robust manipulation and insertion of small parts can be challenging because of the small tolerances typically involved. The key to robust control of these kinds of manipulation interactions is accurate tracking and control of the parts involved. Typically, this is accomplished using visual servoing or force-based control. However, these approaches have drawbacks. Instead, we propose a new approach that uses tactile sensing to accurately localize the pose of a part grasped in the robot hand. Using a feature-based matching technique in conjunction with a newly developed tactile sensing technology known as GelSight that has much higher resolution than competing methods, we synthesize high-resolution height maps of object surfaces. As a result of these high-resolution tactile maps, we are able to localize small parts held in a robot hand very accurately. We quantify localization accuracy in benchtop experiments and experimentally demonstrate the practicality of the approach in the context of a small parts insertion problem.",

        "abstract": "A homography is traditionally formulated as a linear transformation and is used in multiple-view geometry as a linear map between projective planes (or images). Analogous to the use of homography-based techniques to calibrate a pin-hole camera, non-linear homographies extend the pinhole camera model to deal with non-linearities such as lens distortion. In this work, we propose a novel non-parametric nonlinear homography technique. Unlike a parametric non-linear mapping that can have inherent biases, this technique automatically adjusts model complexity to account for non-linearities in observed data. With this technique, we demonstrate nonparametric estimation of lens distortion from a single calibration image. We evaluate this technique on real-world lenses and show that this technique can improve the stability of cameracalibration. Furthermore, the non-parametric nature of our technique allows rectification of arbitrary sources of lens distortion.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new approach for topological localisation of service robots in dynamic indoor environments. In contrast to typical localisation approaches that rely mainly on static parts of the environment, our approach makes explicit use of information about changes by learning and modelling the spatio-temporal dynamics of the environment where the robot is acting. The proposed spatio-temporal world model is able to predict environmental changes in time, allowing the robot to improve its localisation capabilities during long-term operations in populated environments. To investigate the proposed approach, we have enabled a mobile robot to autonomously patrol a populated environment over a period of one week while building the proposed model representation. We demonstrate that the experience learned during one week is applicable for topological localization even after a hiatus of three months by showing that the localization error rate is significantly lower compared to static environment representations.",

        "abstract": "This work introduces a novel balance monitoring strategy for humanoid robots. The proposed method addresses the problem of ensuring the balance maintenance of a humanoid robot, through the online monitoring of its state of balance by means of a Lyapunov (energy) function. The proposed method involves the use of dynamical models accounting for both the link and motor states. Energy limits corresponding to the front and rear edges of the support polygon are computed using a closed-loop Lyapunov function. Therefore, this method focuses on the resolution of two issues through a single control scheme, namely, guaranteeing asymptotical stability of the robot at the joint level, in addition to ensuring that it maintains its dynamical balance. A mathematical proof of the previous claims, as well as of the method's validity, is provided in the paper, whereby a direct relationship between the CoP and the system's energy has been established for the first time. Experimental results of step recovery and walking tests performed on the COmpliant huMANoid (COMAN) corroborate the method's applicability and performance as a balance monitor.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we address the visual servoing problem of robot manipulators with eye-in-hand cameras. To servo-control the image position of a feature point, traditional image-based controllers require the computation of the point's position vector with respect to the camera's frame. However, when the point's location is uncertain, the stability of traditional visual servoing controllers can not be rigorously guaranteed. To contribute to this problem, in this paper we present two new kinematic image-based controllers that do not require the exact location of static features. The first controller is a depth-free method that uses the camera's calibration matrix and visual feedback to compute a quasi-position vector of the feature point. The second controller uses adaptive control techniques to iteratively estimate the calibration matrix and the point's position vector. We prove the stability of both servo-controllers using Lyapunov theory, and present experimental results to evaluate its performance.",

        "abstract": "The ego motion estimation from an image sequence, commonly known as visual odometry, has been thoroughly studied in recent years. Different solutions have been developed depending on the particular scenario the system interacts in. In highly textured environments point features are abundant and visual odometry approaches focus on complementary steps, such as sparse bundle adjustment or keyframe techniques, to improve the accuracy of the motion estimation. In textureless scenarios, the absence of point features motivates the use of different image features. Lines have proven to be an interesting alternative to points in man-made environments, but very few visual odometry approaches have been developed using these types of features. Moreover, the combination of point and line features has not been considered in the development of real-time visual odometry algorithms. In this paper, we explore the combination of point and line features to robustly compute the six degree of freedom motion transformation between consecutive stereo frames. Additionally, we deal with the problem of line stereo matching, since our approach is based on 3D-2D correspondences to estimate motion. We develop an efficient algorithm to compute the stereo line matching, even in situations where one of the endpoints describing the line segment in the left image is not visible in the right image. Several experiments with synthetic and real image sequences show that a simple but effective combination of point and line features improves the motion estimate compared to approaches using only one type of these features with a slight increase in computational cost.",

The proposed continuum robot consists of an elastic tube and a closed loop arm completely independent from the tube. The closed loop arm is a simple thin belt-shaped elastic strip which has two translational joints and one rotary degree of freedom. Here we found that when the closed loop arm was inside the tube and the one side of the translational joint was pushed or pulled, the tube could be bent easily. Based on this basic result, we proposed three types of the closed loop arm shape using bending and twisting of the elastic strip and showed that these arms made the tube deformed into completely different shapes including 180 degrees of rotation. The proposed mechanism was applied to two prototypes. One of them is the magnet resonance compatible manipulator which consists of the \u03b2 titanium pipe of outer radius of 3 mm and the wall thickness of 0.2 mm and the polyetheretherketone resin elastic strip.",

        "abstract": "Control of multiple magnetic particles inside the human body may have many potential applications, such as drug delivery in places where conventional procedures cannot reach. A natural candidate for powering as well as tracking these magnetic particles is the MRI scanner. Although it offers the means to control the particles, it also poses difficulties: the magnetic field is applied uniformly to the group, thus making the independent control of each particle a challenging issue, while the actuation and the tracking are interleaved which can result to delays in actuation and measurement. The closed-loop control of a group of millimeter-scale particles, immersed in fluid, driven by the MRI scanner is studied in this paper. More specifically, this problem is presented in a unified manner, handling such issues as delays, constraints, as well as disturbances, and results in a robustly stable controller. We also propose a condition that effectively answers when the system should be in tracking mode versus actuation mode. In addition to theoretical results, the capability of the proposed controller is illustrated through simulation results.",

        "abstract": "We experimentally demonstrate that using oscillating weak magnetic fields a sperm-shaped microrobot (which we refer to as MagnetoSperm) can swim using flagellar propulsion and slide on a surface under water. The sperm morphology allows the MagnetoSperm to mimic the locomotion mechanism of a living sperm cell. The MagnetoSperm is designed and developed with a magnetic head and a flexible tail to provide a magnetic dipole moment and propulsion, respectively. The head oscillates under the influence of controlled oscillating weak magnetic fields (\u223c5 mT). This oscillation generates a thrust force in the flexible tail, and hence allows the MagnetoSperm to overcome the drag and friction forces during swimming and sliding on a surface, respectively. Point-to-point open- and closed-loop control of the MagnetoSperm are accomplished using an electromagnetic system under microscopic guidance. This motion control is done in two cases, i.e., swimming in water and sliding on a surface. At oscillating magnetic field of 5 Hz and 45 Hz, the MagnetoSperm swims at an average swimming speed of 32 \u00b5m/s (0.1 body lengths per second) and 158 \u00b5m/s (0.5 body lengths per second), respectively. At the same frequencies, the MagnetoSperm slides on the bottom of a petri-dish at an average speed of 21 \u00b5m/s (0.07 body lengths per second) and 6 \u00b5m/s (0.02 body lengths per second), respectively.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports on a novel method for estimating the sensor bias of three-axis magnetometers (or any other field sensor). Our approach employs relative angular position measurements to estimate the three-axis magnetometer measurement bias, significantly improving magnetometer-based attitude estimation. Relative angular position measurements can be calculated from a variety of sources, including multiview image registration or laser-based scan matching. We report two methods implementing this approach based on batch linear least squares and a real-time discrete Kalman filter. Compared with previously reported methods our approach is time independent and less restrictive with data sampling. In addition, our two methods (i) are empirically shown to impose less restrictive conditions for the movements of the instrument required for calibration, (ii) do not require knowledge of the direction of the field (e.g., the local magnetic field) or the attitude of the instrument, and (iii) also ensure convergence for the estimated parameters. The proposed methods are evaluated and compared with previously reported methods in both numerical simulation and in comparative experimental evaluation using cameras and magnetometer sensors under different conditions.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we address the problem of musical genre recognition for a dancing robot with embedded microphones capable of distinguishing the genre of a musical piece while moving in a real-world scenario. For this purpose, we assess and compare two state-of-the-art musical genre recognition systems, based on Support Vector Machines and Markov Models, in the context of different real-world acoustic environments. In addition, we compare different preprocessing robot audition variants (single channel and separated signal from multiple channels) and test different acoustic models, learned a priori, to tackle multiple noise conditions of increasing complexity in the presence of noises of different natures (e.g., robot motion, speech). The results with six different musical genres suggest improved results, in the order of 43.6pp for the most complex conditions, when recurring to Sound Source Separation and acoustic models trained in similar conditions to the testing scenarios. A robot dance demonstration session confirms the applicability of the proposed integration for genre-adaptive dancing robots in real-world noisy environments.",

        "abstract": "Swarms consisting of cyborg-insects or millirobots can be used for mapping and exploration of unstructured environments in emergency-response situations. Under extreme conditions, traditional localization techniques may fail to provide reliable position estimates. Instead, we propose a robust approach to obtain a topological map of an unknown environment using encounter information from a swarm of agents following a stochastic motion model via the use of tools from topological data analysis. A classification approach is introduced to determine the persistent topology features of the space. The approach is analyzed using simulation and experimental data using a swarm robotic platform called the WolfBot. For all experiments, the agents are programmed to follow a stochastic motion model and only rely on encounter information between agents to construct a map of the environment. The results indicate that the proposed approach can identify robust topological features with high accuracy.",

        "abstract": "In hands-on robotic surgery, the surgeon controls the motion of a tool mounted on the end effector by applying forces directly to the robot. The mass and inertia properties of the robot at the end effector thus contribute to the ability of the surgeon to move the tool and consequently, the performance of the surgery. As redundant robots have varying mass/inertia properties for different configurations at the same position and orientation of the end effector, we present optimizations which affect the inertial properties to improve the surgeon's movement capabilities. A method for optimizing the overall belted mass/inertia ellipsoids based on the determinant of the inverse pseudo kinetic energy matrices is presented, along with a method for optimizing the effective mass/inertia in a particular direction. Using a gradient based controller operating in the null-space of the end effector position and orientation, the measures are optimized to the local optima without affecting the surgeon's desired tool pose. Through simulation, the efficacy of the method is demonstrated and a comparison with two standard approaches to redundancy resolution is performed. Lastly, a pre-optimized solution is shown to be effective for heavily constrained environments which prevent active optimization.",

Our method works directly with point clusters by identifying what has changed from one observation to the next, removing the dynamic elements and at the same time adding previously occluded objects to reconstruct the underlying static structure as accurately as possible. The process of constructing the meta-rooms is iterative and it is designed to incorporate new data as it becomes available, as well as to be robust to environment changes. The latest estimate of the meta-room is used to differentiate and extract clusters of dynamic objects from observations. In addition, we present a method for re-identifying the extracted dynamic objects across observations thus mapping their spatial behaviour over extended periods of time.",

        "abstract": "A novel micro surgical system with a micro laser ablation module integrated with an imaging sensor is designed and developed for minimally invasive surgery. The system consists of a Nd:YAG laser source with the wavelength of 1064nm to remove lesion, a CCD camera to guide laser, a parallel four-bar mechanism, an endoscope bending section, a rigid steel tube, an aluminum-alloy supporting table and a personal computer for sending control commands. The advantage of the system is the small size of its distal module, i.e., the diameter and the length of the module are 3.5 millimeters and 15.0 millimeters, respectively. A methodological frame for ablating lesion using the system proposed is developed based on the system configuration. Experiments on ex-vivo swine tissue are implemented to evaluate laser ablation performance of the prototyped system.",

        "abstract": "Interest in low-cost force-torque sensors with high performance will continue to increase in the next years, as robot control needs to rely on more sensors to move into the human environment. Existing force-torque sensors still suffer from some shortcomings such as noise sensitivity, low resolution and high cost. This limits their use in some emerging applications. Through an advanced systematic design method based on a symbolic formulation of the wrench-displacement relationship, we designed compact and cost-effective three-axis capacitance-based force sensor. Despite its relative simplicity, our sensor exhibits a very good sensitivity thanks to the electronic components selected, but also to a special soft silicone layer filled with nanoparticles of ferroelectric ceramic. This composite we made has a relatively high dielectric constant. This paper presents the design process that led to the sensor including the structure, the capacitance measurement circuit and the fabrication of the soft dielectric. Characterization tests have also been carried out on a prototype of the sensor and the results show that it is sensitive and easy to fabricate.",

In contrast to popular bag-of-words scene descriptors, which rely on a library of vector quantized visual features, our proposed scene descriptor is based on a library of raw image data (such as an available visual experience, images shared by other colleague robots, and publicly available image data on the web) and directly mine it to find visual phrases (VPs) that discriminatively and compactly explain an input query / database image. Our mining approach is motivated by recent success in the field of common pattern discovery-specifically mining of common visual patterns among scenes-and requires only a single library of raw images that can be acquired at different time or day. Experimental results show that even though our scene descriptor is significantly more compact than conventional descriptors it has a relatively higher recognition performance.",

Beside the mobility, i.e. overground walking, due to introduced degrees of freedom (DOFs) CORBYS gait rehabilitation system, in contrast to existing gait rehabilitation robotic systems will enable more physiological movements including turning. The focus in the paper is on novel push-pull control (PPC) cables based actuation system of the orthosis. The first results on orthosis actuation obtained in the control experiments with the powered orthosis test-stand are shown. The results prove the advantages of using the push-pull cables for the dislocation of the actuators from the powered orthosis and for providing a flexible power actuation with a bi-directional (pushing and pulling) force transfer.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the issue of monitoring physical spatial phenomena of interest utilizing the information collected by a network of mobile, wireless and noisy sensors that can take discrete measurements as they navigate through the environment. The spatial phenomenon is statistically modelled by a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) with hyperparameters that are learnt as the measurements accumulate over time. In this context, the GMRF approximately represents the spatial field on an irregular lattice of triangulation by exploiting a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach, which benefits remarkably in computation due to the sparsity of the precision matrix. A technique of the one-step-ahead forecast is employed to predict the future measurements that are required to find the optimal sampling locations. It is shown that optimizing the sampling path problem with the logarithm of the determinant either of a covariance matrix using a GP model or of a precision matrix using a GMRF model for mobile robotic wireless sensor networks (MRWSNs) even by a greedy algorithm is impractical. This paper proposes an efficient novel optimality criterion for the adaptive sampling strategy to find the most informative locations in taking future observations that minimize the uncertainty at unobserved locations. The computational complexity of our proposed method is linear, which makes the MRWSN scalable and practically feasible. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is compared and demonstrated using a pre-published data set with appealing results.",

Using a sequence of contact stances from an offline multi-contact planner, we use first a Model Predictive Controller to generate a dynamic trajectory of the center of mass, then a whole-body closed-loop model-based controller to track it at best. Relatively to Nagasaka's work, we allow frame changes of the preferred force, provide a heuristic to compute the timing of the transition from purely geometrical features and investigate the synchronization problem between the reduced-model preview control and the whole-body controller. Using our framework, we generate a wide range of 3D motions, while accounting for predictable external forces, which includes transporting objects.

We show that using the developed model, the vehicle pose and two components of the wind velocity vector can be simultaneously estimated with a monocular camera and an inertial measurement unit. We also show that the MA-VIF is reasonably tolerant to wind disturbances, even without explicit modelling of wind effects and explain the reasons for this behaviour. Experimental results using a Vicon motion capture system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and validate our claims.",

        "abstract": "The paper addresses path planning for a redundant robot arm that is maneuvering in confined spaces, where neither an explicit model nor external perception of the possibly frequently changing environment is available. Our approach is rather solely based on data from kinesthetic demonstrations of feasible configurations provided by a user. The key challenge is to create a graph-based representation of the demonstrated free space incrementally and online by means of an specifically tailored instantaneous topological map at runtime. Subsequent application of standard graph-based planning in combination with a learned generalization of the demonstrated redundancy resolution then enables the robot to safely move in the realm of the demonstrated task space areas. This model-free approach greatly enhances configurability and flexibility of the robot for assistance applications, where movement capabilities need to be realized without explicit programming.",

        "abstract": "Safety is one of the key issues in the use of robots, especially when human-robot interaction is targeted. Although unforeseen environment situations, such as collisions or unexpected user interaction, can be handled with specially tailored control algorithms, hard- or software failures typically lead to situations where too large torques are controlled, which cause an emergency state: hitting an end stop, exceeding a torque, and so on-which often halts the robot when it is too late. No sufficiently fast and reliable methods exist which can early detect faults in the abundance of sensor and controller data. This is especially difficult since, in most cases, no anomaly data are available. In this paper we introduce a new robot anomaly detection system (RADS) which can cope with abundant data in which no or very little anomaly information is present.",

The surgical robot consists of a snake-like 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) guide tube, two 7-DOF tools, a 3-DOF stereo camera, and a 5-DOF slave arm. The robot is capable of reaching various surgical sites inside the abdominal cavity from a single incision on the body. To estimate the workspace and control the guide tube to a desired location, we first obtain the forward kinematics model of the guide tube and then propose a Cartesian-level controller. The wire actuation mechanism for the tools exhibit nonlinear backlash behavior because of wire compliance and friction between the wire and Teflon-coated conduit. We compensate for the backlash in the tool joints by adding the backlash inverse with smoothing term as a feedforward term.",

It is promising if we can combine human's flexibility and robot's productivity in manufacturing. This paper investigates the modeling and controller design method of workspace sharing human-robot assembly teams and adopts a two-layer interaction model between the human and the robot. In theoretical analysis, enforcing invariance in a safe set guarantees safety. In implementation, an integrated method concerning online learning of closed loop human behavior and receding horizon control in the safe set is proposed. Simulation results in a 2D setup confirm the safety and efficiency of the algorithm.",

This paper proposes a new approach where objects are situated at the air/liquid interface and are manipulated through magnetic fields. It demonstrates that a good repeatability and a high speed can be obtained. A physical modeling is presented to analyze the dynamic behavior of the micro-object. Experiments are performed to determine the physical parameters of the model and to attest the good repeatability of the motion for an object of size 100\u00d790\u00d725\u00b5m3. A good agreement between the physical model and the experimental measurement is demonstrated. Since the velocity of the micro-object can be 10 times higher at the air/liquid interface than in the liquid this approach represents a promising solution to design smart surfaces for a high throughput conveying of micro-objects.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to model motion patterns of dynamic objects, such as people and vehicles, in the environment with the occupancy grid map representation. Corresponding to the ever-changing nature of the motion pattern of dynamic objects, we model each occupancy grid cell by an IOHMM, which is an inhomogeneous variant of the HMM. This distinguishes our work from existing methods which use the conventional HMM, assuming motion evolving according to a stationary process. By introducing observations of neighbor cells in the previous time step as input of IOHMM, the transition probabilities in our model are dependent on the occurrence of events in the cell's neighborhood. This enables our method to model the spatial correlation of dynamics across cells. A sequence processing example is used to illustrate the advantage of our model over conventional HMM based methods. Results from the experiments in an office corridor environment demonstrate that our method is capable of capturing dynamics of such human living environments.",

We present and describe the concept of human navigational habituation which we define as the human habituation to repetitively riding a robotic wheelchair. The approach models habituation in terms of preferred linear velocity based on the experience of riding a wheelchair. We argue that preferred velocity changes as the human gets used to riding on the wheelchair. Inexperienced users initially prefer to ride at a slow moderate pace, however the longer they ride they prefer to speed up to a certain comfort level and find initial slower velocities to be tediously \u201ctoo slow\u201d for their experience level. The proposed habituation model provides passenger preferred velocity based on experience. Human biological measurements, galvanic skin conductance, and participant feedback demonstrate the preference for habituation velocity control over fixed velocity control. To our knowledge habituation modeling is new in the field of autonomous navigation and robotics.",

        "abstract": "The present work models the dynamics of general skid-steer mobile manipulators using the formalism and tools of the spatial vectors algebra introduced by Featherstone. The model built is validated using inertial measurements obtained during field tests with a compact skid-steer loader. The paper demonstrates the benefits of using the spatial vector algebra formulation, showing that this modeling approach allows to integrate traction forces and study the arm-vehicle, as well as vehicle-ground interactions in a single model. This feature is not possible with many other of the existing modeling approaches and simulation tools, thus opens the way to research on mechanically more complex robot designs and their controllers. It is to be noted that most of the existing models and simulations of mobile manipulators consider two-wheeled differentially driven bases and avoid accurate models of skid-steering bases because of the complexity of simulating wheels that skid while rolling. However, skid-steer traction is common in most of the industrial construction and mining machinery because of their simpler mechanics, high reliability, and better mobility in rough terrains. Hence, the development of physically accurate models of skid-steer manipulators is fundamental. We chose to validate the model using a Cat\u00ae 262C compact-skid steer loader instead of a small mobile manipulator common in robotics research laboratory to highlight the usefulness of the presented model and the spatial vector algebra approach.",

        "abstract": "Increasing efficiency by improving the locomotion methods is a key issue for underwater robots. Consequently, an accurate dynamic model is important for both controller design and for the development of efficient locomotion methods. This paper presents a model of the kinematics and dynamics of an underwater snake robot moving in a vertical plane in 3D. The fluid contact forces (hydrodynamic forces) and torques (fluid moments) are modeled using analytical fluid dynamics. Hydrodynamic forces and torques, i.e. linear and nonlinear drag forces, current effects, added mass and fluid torque effects, are considered. In addition, this modeling approach also takes into account the hydrostatic forces (gravitational forces and buoyancy). The model is given in a closed form and is thus in a form that is well-suited for modern model-based control schemes. The proposed model is easily implemented and simulated, regardless of the number of robot links. Simulation results for lateral undulation and eel-like motion with a ten link robotic system are presented.",

        "abstract": "We formulate the problem of wheeled mobile robot (WMR) modeling under wheel slip, while moving over rough terrain, as the integral of a differential algebraic equation (DAE) of either first or second order. That is, the elements of the model include both differential equations and kinematic constraints. While such a formulation is typical of Lagrangian dynamics in augmented form, we show how identical principles apply to kinematic models of motion. In effect, we show in this paper that the very high fidelity models traditionally used in offline simulation can be readily adapted for use in real time for both control and estimation of the motion of arbitrary WMRs over arbitrary rolling terrain, while slipping. While such models are more correct and general than the naive methods that are typically used, we also show that they are orders of magnitude more efficient than such naive methods for equivalent accuracy.",

Teleoperation of agile robotic systems in three dimensional environments would benefit from a detailed understanding of the perceptual control mechanisms used by the operator both for the design of operator interfaces and potentially for the use of gaze information as part of the control mechanism. The objective of this work is to model the role and contribution of the operator's gaze motion in remote control operation of an agile vehicle. The experiments were conducted using a miniature remote controlled helicopter. The overall human-machine system is described using a multi-loop manual control model. Experiments were designed and conducted to exercise different aspects of this control hierarchy, encompassing stabilization and regulation as well as trajectory tracking and goal directed guidance. The sensing requirements for each loop are established by investigating the relationship between the operator's visual gaze trajectories, the vehicle trajectories, and the control actions. Visual gaze data is classified according to the typical smooth pursuit, saccades and fixations and then incorporated into an estimation strategy.",

Commensurate with the technology hurdles, the amount of time and money required can also be prohibitive barriers. This paper describes Team THOR's approach to overcoming such barriers for the 2013 DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) Trials. We focused on forming modular components - in both hardware and software - to allow for efficient and cost effective parallel development. The robotic hardware consists of standardized and general purpose actuators and structural components. These allowed us to successfully build the robot from scratch in a very short development period, modify configurations easily and perform quick field repair. Our modular software framework consists of a hybrid locomotion controller, a hierarchical arm controller and a platform-independent operator interface. These modules helped us to keep up with hardware changes easily and to have multiple control options to suit various situations. We validated our approach at the DRC Trials where we fared very well against robots many times more expensive.",

Our approach is able to estimate the 3D vehicle pose, velocity and steering angle of the leader vehicles and needs template images of each vehicle. The improved template-based algorithm refers to a previously publication. First, we present an extension of our dynamic region growing algorithm, which is used to remove unnecessary image information. Thanks to a new preprocessing step, the segmentation algorithm is more stable while finding the vehicle silhouette. Second, we achieve an improved pose estimation by using rotated image features. Third, the extensive comparison of algorithms to train cascade classifiers leads to the best one for vehicle detection. The algorithm was evaluated while driving autonomously in urban and non-urban environments. Experimental validation shows that our approach can detect and track poorly visible vehicles under different weather conditions in real-time.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the open challenge of planning quasi-static walking motions for robots with kinematically redundant limbs. Focusing on RoboSimian, a quadrupedal robot developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), we develop a practical method for generating statically stable walking motions by pre-computing a reduced dimensional inverse kinematics (IK) lookup table with certain uniqueness and smoothness properties. We then use that lookup table to generate IK solutions at the beginning and end of walking phases (e.g., swing, body shift, etc), and connect these waypoints using the Rapidly exploring Random Tree Connect (RRT-Connect) algorithm [1]. Thus, we avoid arbitrarily choosing an IK solution at the goal (that may turn out to be difficult to reach from the start) by setting this choice through design and use of a task-specific lookup table, which can be analyzed offline. Our approach also introduces a complementary formulation of the RRT-Connect configuration space that addresses contact and closure constraints by using the forward kinematics of one stance leg to determine the body pose while treating additional stance limbs as dependent on the body pose and solving their inverse kinematics with IK table lookup. We demonstrate an implementation of some of this framework on RoboSimian and discuss generalizations and extensions.",

However, it is challenging to gather desirable information about these robots' behaviors as conventional sensory systems are not designed to detect infinite degrees of freedom on continuum bodies. This paper presents a technical method to sensorize a soft elastic body by using conductive thermoplastic elastomer (CTPE) based strain gauge sensors. Due to its thermoplastic nature, CTPE based sensors can be fabricated in flexible sizes and shapes and integrated into the soft elastic bodies. We analyze soft elastic deformations and extract strain vectors to find finite unique regions on continuum surfaces. Then we use these regions to design the morphologies of our fiber shaped CTPE sensors to discriminate soft robotic behaviors. To demonstrate our approach and show how the programmable sensor morphologies discriminate different motion patterns, we have built a soft elastic prismatic silicone (E = 1.31MPa) block and designed two sensors to discriminate serpentine and twisting patterns.",

        "abstract": "We present an optimization-based motion planner for medical steerable needles that explicitly considers motion and sensing uncertainty while guiding the needle to a target in 3D anatomy. Motion planning for needle steering is challenging because the needle is a nonholonomic and underactuated system, the needle's motion may be perturbed during insertion due to unmodeled needle/tissue interactions, and medical sensing modalities such as ultrasound imaging and x-ray projection imaging typically provide only noisy and partial state information. To account for these uncertainties, we introduce a motion planner that computes a trajectory and corresponding linear controller in the belief space - the space of distributions over the state space. We formulate the needle steering motion planning problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) that approximates belief states as Gaussians. We then compute a locally optimal trajectory and corresponding controller that minimize in belief space a cost function that considers avoidance of obstacles, penalties for unsafe control inputs, and target acquisition accuracy. We apply the motion planner to simulated scenarios and show that local optimization in belief space enables us to compute higher quality plans compared to planning solely in the needle's state space.",

The robot is inspired by the morphology and outstanding locomotor capabilities of the octopus, and is fabricated primarily from compliant materials. This robotic swimmer is first investigated computationally via dynamical models capturing the arm and web compliance, and indicating the effect of various kinematic parameters of the system on its motion. The performance of the robotic prototype is, then, tested experimentally, to demonstrate this novel mode of underwater propulsion by combining various patterns of sculling movements of the arms and web. Speeds of 0.5 body lengths per second and propulsive forces of up to 10.5 N were achieved, with a cost of transport as low as 0.62.",

Trajectories of the leg employ various biomimetic motions produced by SPG(swimming pattern generator), setting simple control parameters. Performances of the leg are verified by measuring drag force by a force/torque sensor through underwater experiments. In the paper, swimming mechanism is mainly concerned for this time. Consequently, we proved the validity of designing consideration for the multi-functional leg.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Often times in mobile robotics, optimizing a sequence of tasks and the paths between those destinations is an essential factor. In simple cases, this problem can be modeled by the well-researched Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). In more complex situations however, the TSP is not a suitable model. In redundant robotic systems, a robot can assume infinitely many configurations while performing each given task. In these cases, not only is it necessary to optimize the sequence of tasks, but an optimal configuration must be defined for each task as well. This optimization problem can be better modeled by the Traveling Salesman Problem with Neighborhoods (TSPN) in which nodes can move in given domains called neighborhoods. However, one of the limiting factors to the TSPN is that it cannot efficiently solve realistic instances with non-connected neighborhoods. This research proposes an approach to this problem in which the TSPN is extended into a Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem with Neighborhoods (GTSPN) where each node can be located in multiple regions, called neighborhoodsets. An heuristic procedure is proposed to find a near-optimal tour for GTSPN instances using a genetic algorithm approach. Numerical simulations performed on randomly generated instances with up to 300 neighborhoods show that the proposed procedure determines tours for a given instance within a 1% standard deviation error from the best-known tour.",

The experiments elucidate that the developed gripper achieves envelop grasping; the posture of the gripper automatically fits the shape of the object with no sensory feedback. And they also show that the VSM effectively works to relieve external interfering.

The unstable effect arising from interaction tasks is considered, and the arm stability is directly treated as one of the control objectives in the controller design. By exploiting the kinematic and muscular redundancy of the system, we can control the interaction force and the arm's stiffness property simultaneously, thus ensuring the stable execution of interaction tasks. A representative example of such interaction tasks, namely the \u201cpushing with a stick\u201d task, is simulated. It is found that using our proposed controller, as compared to a previously developed feedforward FES controller that does not consider arm stiffness or stability, the stability of the arm is guaranteed while the task of force control is correctly achieved.",

The overall goal is to plan for the trajectories of the robots in order to track the most number of targets, and accurately estimate the target locations using the images. The two objectives can conflict since a robot may fly to a higher altitude and potentially cover a larger number of targets at the expense of accuracy. We start by showing that k \u2265 3 robots may not be able to track all n targets while maintaining a constant factor approximation of the optimal quality of tracking at all times. Next, we study the problem of choosing robot trajectories to maximize either the number of targets tracked or the quality of tracking. We formulate this problem as the weighted version of a combinatorial optimization problem known as the Maximum Group Coverage (MGC) problem.

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a distributed and decentralised method to solve the cooperative localisation problem utilising the factor graph framework. This method enables vehicles to create compact packets of their own sensor information between their involvement in intervehicle measurements. The packets are limited in size, with this size dependent on the size of the state space alone. The number of packets generated is also limited at two packets (one per vehicle) created per intervehicle measurement. The packets and measurements can be shared and propagated to all vehicles not just direct neighbours or to vehicles involved in the measurements. Vehicles maintain a local solver that incorporates all local sensor information and motion updates in full nonlinear form and includes the fixed linearised packets from other vehicles. This local solver is able to update local state variables and relinearise local and intervehicle factors but has to hold remote state variables and packet data at a fixed linearisation point. We show the estimated solution is of a similar quality to a state of the art centralised relinearising estimator iSAM2 and superior to a fixed linearisation filtering solution via comparing RMS error in position estimation in simulation. Consistency of the method is also shown via the NEES metric. Communication requirements for each of the competing methods are shown, with compaction of packets being more useful the larger the ratio between intervehicle and local measurement intervals. The technique is validated using multi-vehicle simulation and real datasets.",

        "abstract": "The focus of this work is addressing the challenges of performing object recognition in real world scenes as captured by a commercial, state-of-the-art, surveying vehicle equipped with a 360\u00b0 panoramic camera in conjunction with a 3D laser scanner (LIDAR). Even with state-of-the-art surveying equipment, there is colour saturation and very dark regions in images, as well as some degree of time-varying misalignment between the point cloud data and imagery due to, for instance, imperfect tracking of sensor pose. Moreover, there are frequent occlusions due to both static and moving objects. These issues are inherently difficult to avoid and therefore need to be dealt with in a more robust fashion. This is where the contribution of the paper is; that is, the development of a consensus method that can intelligently incorporate feature responses from multiple views and reject those that are not very descriptive. It is shown that the overall performance in a ten class problem is increased from 70.5% for a simple 2D-3D classification system, to 77.5%. Subsequently, an enhanced CRF which has become robust using the misclassifications of training data and equipped with the probabilities of the adjacent points, was applied to the system and further improved its performance to 82.9%. The experiments were performed on a challenging dataset captured both in summer and winter.",

Inspired by human cognition, our approach is to treat this as a contingency detection problem. We present a simple discriminative Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to compare against previous generative methods introduced in prior work by Lee et al. [1]. We evaluate these methods in two ways. First, by training three separate SVMs with multi-modal sensory input on a set of batch data collected in a controlled setting, where we obtain an average F1 score of 0.82. Second, in an open-ended experiment setting with seven participants, we show that our model is able to perform contingency detection in real-time and generalize to new people with a best F1 score of 0.72.",

        "abstract": "Humans develop their concept of an object by classifying it into a category, and acquire language by interacting with others at the same time. Thus, the meaning of a word can be learnt by connecting the recognized word and concept. We consider such an ability to be important in allowing robots to flexibly develop their knowledge of language and concepts. Accordingly, we propose a method that enables robots to acquire such knowledge. The object concept is formed by classifying multimodal information acquired from objects, and the language model is acquired from human speech describing object features. We propose a stochastic model of language and concepts, and knowledge is learnt by estimating the model parameters. The important point is that language and concepts are interdependent. There is a high probability that the same words will be uttered to objects in the same category. Similarly, objects to which the same words are uttered are highly likely to have the same features. Using this relation, the accuracy of both speech recognition and object classification can be improved by the proposed method. However, it is difficult to directly estimate the parameters of the proposed model, because there are many parameters that are required. Therefore, we approximate the proposed model, and estimate its parameters using a nested Pitman-Yor language model and multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation to acquire the language and concept, respectively.",

In this research, a new 8 degrees of freedom (DOFs) rehabilitation robot arm named NTUH-II has been developed. The robot arm is able to provide most of upper limb rehabilitation motions in passive, active, and assistive modes. From the nature of muscle stretching, the exponential torque-angle relationship curve can be found, and thus it is possible to model and evaluate the condition of the patient's motion quality. The use of two parameters, stiffness and control authority, is proposed in this work. Based on these two parameters, an adjustment method of dynamic torque gain is developed and implemented on NTUH-II. Various experiments have been conducted, and appealing performance has been observed, which validates the method proposed in this paper.",

        "abstract": "A mobile visual sensor network has a potential to create impacts in many applications in the society; however, it remains a challenge to keep the network lifetime as long as possible with limited onboard energy. Based on our previous work, mobility can be exploited to improve network lifetime significantly for data-intensive mobile sensor networks. In a visual sensor network, besides heavy data transmission, the video encoding process consumes a considerable portion of the energy. With the quality of visual sensing in mind, this paper investigates a joint design method to simultaneously design mobility, source data rate, routing, and video encoding strategies for robotic visual sensor nodes to improve the lifetime of a mobile visual sensor network. We formulate the network lifetime problem as a nonlinear, non-convex, optimization problem, and we propose to solve it distributively by a series of convex approximations and a proposed novel algorithm. Computer simulations were conducted to verify its quick convergence to the solution and the improvement of the lifetime of the network using mobility.",

        "abstract": "Numerous kinematic structures have been developed for snake-like robots over the past several decades. A well studied structure consists of a series of rigid segments coupled with rotational joints. In some designs, adjacent segments are coupled with a 2-DOF pitch/yaw joint. In others, segments are coupled through 1-DOF joints, with joints alternating between pitch and yaw. This paper focuses on a robotic snake that implements both rotational and translational degrees of freedom in each joint. The added translational degrees give rise to several new gaits. In the paper, we present a new rectilinear crawling gait and two new rolling gaits. These gaits are analyzed through simulation, and compared to existing crawling and rolling gaits.",

Non-vector space control employs sets as the states and formulates dynamics equations in the space of sets. This method provides a natural description of physical phenomena such as images. When applied to nanomanipulations, it excludes the use of external position sensors, and the positioning precision can be as good as the imaging resolution. In this paper, we investigate the stochastic control problem for non-vector space dynamic systems when the sets are corrupted by random noises. We use Kalman filtering to estimate the true set for feedback control. The stability of the method is investigated. We apply the method to atomic force microscope (AFM) system to improve position accuracies of nanomanipulations. Simulation and experimental results have clearly validated the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "This study proposed a method for the fine alignment of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp used in multiple microcontact printing. The procedure of alignment method was organized into three steps; (1) the fabrication of PDMS stamp with an alignment marker, (2) the position detection of PDMS stamp with a noncontact laser displacement sensor on an automated planar x-y axes stage, and (3) the position adjustment of PDMS stamp to target position with another automated planar x-y-\u03b8 axes stage. The procedure was able to perform without contact onto the surface of PDMS stamp just before the moment of contact printing. Therefore, the surface would be safe from molecular/bacterial contamination. This study implemented the procedure into a developed system for the alignment of PDMS stamp. After adjusting the position of PDMS stamps applied with fibronectin-binding-fluorescent dyes with three different colors, contact printing was performed. As a result, the error of position between two different patterns of fibronectin was within 33 \u03bcm. This method would be useful for generating a multi-type-cellular tissue in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",

        "abstract": "Planning robot motions often requires a notion of the \u201cdistance\u201d between configurations or the \u201clength\u201d of a trajectory connecting them in the configuration space. If these quantities are defined so as to correspond to the effort required to change configurations, then they would likely differ from the Euclidean distance or arclength in the system's configuration parameters, distorting the visual representation of the relative costs of executing the motions. This problem is fundamentally similar to that of producing map projections with minimal distortion in cartography. A separate problem is that of nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR), which, given a set of data, projects it into a lower-dimensional space while seeking to retain the geometric relationship between data points. In this paper, we show that NLDR can be applied to the kinematic cartography problem, allowing us to generate system parameterizations in which distance and arclength correspond to the effort of motion.",

        "abstract": "SLAM can be viewed as an estimation problem over graphs. It is well known that the topology of each dataset affects the quality of the corresponding optimal estimate. In this paper we present a formal analysis of the impact of graph structure on the reliability of the maximum likelihood estimator. In particular, we show that the number of spanning trees in the graph is closely related to the D-optimality criterion in experimental design. We also reveal that in a special class of linear-Gaussian estimation problems over graphs, the algebraic connectivity is related to the E-optimality design criterion. Furthermore, we explain how the average node degree of the graph is related to the ratio between the minimum of negative log-likelihood achievable and its value at the ground truth. These novel insights give us a deeper understanding of the SLAM problem. Finally we discuss two important applications of our analysis in active measurement selection and graph pruning. The results obtained from simulations and experiments on real data confirm our theoretical findings.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel three-DOF ankle mechanism is introduced. A lower-limb exoskeleton is developed by our research group to strengthen wearer's muscle power in military missions. Owing to the tough operational condition, each module of the exoskeleton should be carefully designed for safety and to reduce the sense of fatigue of the wearer. To this end, it is desirable for the ankle module to be lightweight and compact and to have a remote center of rotation which is closely located to the rotation center of the wearer's ankle. In order to satisfy these design considerations, the proposed ankle mechanism consists of the parallel connection of a spherical five-bar linkage and an RSU (revolute-spherical-universal)- serial chain. The spherical five-bar linkage realizes two-DOF ankle rotations of inversion/eversion and internal/external rotation, and the RSU-serial chain controls the ankle dorsiflexion/plantar flexion. The forward and inverse kinematics are derived, and instantaneous kinematics as well as force relations are analyzed by deriving the screw-based Jacobian and the reciprocal Jacobian. Finally, based on the gait data obtained from a normal subject with 4km/h of walking speed and 45kg of backpack load, the initial version of it is designed as a fully passive-type mechanism with a torsional spring. It is shown from a simulation that 42% reduction of the wearer's ankle peak torque is expected by using the proposed ankle exoskeleton.",

        "abstract": "This work addresses a vision-based target tracking problem between a mobile observer and a target in the presence of a circular obstacle. The task of keeping the target in the observer's field-of-view is modeled as a pursuit-evasion game by assuming that the target is adversarial in nature. Due to the presence of obstacles, this is formulated as a game with state constraints. The objective of the observer is to maintain a line-of-sight with the target at all times. The objective of the target is to break the line-of-sight in finite amount of time. First, we establish that the value of the game exists in this setting. Then we reduce the dimension of the problem by formulating the game in relative coordinates, and present a discretization in time and space for the reduced game. Based on this discretization, we use a fully discrete semi-Lagrangian scheme to compute the Kru\u017ekov transform of the value function numerically, and show that the scheme converges for our problem. Finally, we compute the optimal control action of the players from the Kru\u017ekov transform of the value function, and demonstrate the performance of the numerical scheme by numerous simulations.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider an object recognition problem based on tactile information using a robot hand. The robot performs an exploratory action to the object to obtain the tactile information, however, poorly designed actions may not be sufficiently informative. In contrast, if we could collect sample data by sequentially performing informative actions, i.e., active learning, the required time would be drastically reduced. To this end, we propose a novel approach for active tactile object recognition. Our approach combines both an active learning scheme and a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method. We first extracts the object manifold, each coordinate of which represents an object, from tactile sensor data and action features using Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models. At the same time, a probabilistic model of the observed data related to the action and the object are learned. Then, with the learned model, optimally-informative exploratory actions can be computed sequentially, and performed to efficiently collect the data for recognition. We show experimental results that verify the effectiveness of our proposed method with synthetic data and a real robot.",

        "abstract": "We present an approach for object class learning using a part-based shape categorization in RGB-augmented 3D point clouds captured from cluttered indoor scenes with a Kinect-like sensor. We propose an unsupervised hierarchical learning procedure which allows to symbolically classify shape parts by different specificity levels of detailedness of their surface-structural appearance. Further, a hierarchical graphical model is learned that reflects the constellation of classified parts from the set of specificity levels learned in the previous step. Finally an energy minimization inference procedure is applied on the hierarchical graphical model to obtain the corresponding shape category of an object instance consisting of a set of shape parts. Experiments show, due to the proposed classification by learning the hierarchy of shape parts combined with generating the hierarchical graphical constellation model of shape parts, the additional evidence on different levels of shape detailedness is a major factor that leads to a more robust and accurate categorization compared to a flat approach. The experiments are conducted for shape categories (sack, barrel and parcel) which typically appear in visuoperceptual-challenging scenarios of logistic processes.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for high-quality omnidirectional 3D reconstruction of augmented Manhattan worlds from catadioptric stereo video sequences. In contrast to existing works we do not rely on constructing virtual perspective views, but instead propose to optimize depth jointly in a unified omnidirectional space. Furthermore, we show that plane-based prior models can be applied even though planes in 3D do not project to planes in the omnidirectional domain. Towards this goal, we propose an omnidirectional slanted-plane Markov random field model which relies on plane hypotheses extracted using a novel voting scheme for 3D planes in omnidirectional space. To quantitatively evaluate our method we introduce a dataset which we have captured using our autonomous driving platform AnnieWAY which we equipped with two horizontally aligned catadioptric cameras and a Velodyne HDL-64E laser scanner for precise ground truth depth measurements. As evidenced by our experiments, the proposed method clearly benefits from the unified view and significantly outperforms existing stereo matching techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively. Furthermore, our method is able to reduce noise and the obtained depth maps can be represented very compactly by a small number of image segments and plane parameters.",

Micro-UAVs have the potential to further improve and enrich the data collected by operating close to the crops, enabling the collection of higher spatio-temporal resolution data. In this paper, we present a UAV-mounted measurement system that utilizes a laser scanner to compute crop heights, a critical indicator of crop health. The system filters, transforms, and analyzes the cluttered range data in real-time to determine the distance to the ground and to the top of the crops. We assess the system in an indoor testbed and in a corn field. Our findings indicate that despite the dense canopy and highly variable sensor readings, we can precisely fly over crops and measure its height to within 5cm of measurements gathered using current measurement technology.",

Fixed-point iteration is a method of computing fixed points of functions and there are several fixed-point theorems to guarantee the existence of fixed points. With the help of proximal point functions, the complementarity problems that arise in multibody dynamics can be rewritten in a form suitable for solution by a fixed-point iteration method. This fixed-point \u201cprox method\u201d has been popular over the last decades. However, the tuning of the iteration parameter r is difficult, because r affects the convergence of the fixed-point iteration method in ways not understood by current theoretical results. In this paper, we first investigate some factors that affect the choice of r, which further determines the convergence rate. Also we study the loss of accuracy caused by a commonly used relaxation parameter, which is known as \u201cconstraint force mixing\u201d.",

        "abstract": "The MIT Cheetah demonstrated a stable 6 m/s trot gait in the sagittal plane utilizing the self-stable characteristics of locomotion. This paper presents a numerical analysis of the behavior of a quadruped robot model with the proposed controller. We first demonstrate the existence of periodic trot gaits at various speeds and examine local orbital stability of each trajectory using Poincar`e map analysis. Beyond the local stability, we additionally demonstrate the stability of the model against large initial perturbations. Stability of trot gaits at a wide range of speed enables gradual acceleration demonstrated in this paper and a real machine. This simulation study also suggests the upper limit of the command speed that ensures stable steady-state running. As we increase the command speed, we observe series of period-doubling bifurcations, which suggests presence of chaotic dynamics beyond a certain level of command speed. Extension of this simulation analysis will provide useful guidelines for searching control parameters to further improve the system performance.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the influence of torso compliance on the efficiency of quadrupedal running with a bounding gait. Two sagittal-plane models, one with and one without torso compliance, are developed in a template setting. The models feature non-trivial leg mass, and are coupled with a simple leg recirculation controller to generate bounding motions. Despite their simplicity, the proposed models are sufficiently expressive to capture the energetics of bounding motions and to assess the contribution of torso flexibility to gait efficiency measured by the cost of transport. Comparisons reveal that torso compliance promotes locomotion performance by reducing energy consumption only at speeds that are sufficiently high.",

        "abstract": "We present a grid-based 3D reconstruction method which integrates all costs given by stereo vision into what we call a Cost-Curve Occupancy Grid (CCOG). Occupancy probabilities of grid cells are estimated in a Bayesian formulation, from the likelihood of stereo cost measurements taken at all distance hypotheses. This is accomplished with only a small set of probabilistic assumptions which we discuss in the paper. We quantitatively characterize the method's performance under different conditions of both image noise and number of used stereo pairs, compared also to traditional algorithms. We complement the study by giving insights on design choices of CCOGs such as likelihood model, window size of the cost function and use of a hole filling method. Experiments were made on a real-world outdoors dataset with ground-truth data.",

        "abstract": "The shape and center of mass of a part are crucial parameters to algorithms for planning automated manufacturing tasks. As industrial parts are generally manufactured to tolerances, the shape is subject to variations, which, in turn, also cause variations in the location of the center of mass. Planning algorithms should take into account both types of variation to prevent failure when the resulting plans are applied to manufactured incarnations of a model part. We study the relation between variation in part shape and variation in the location of the center of mass for a part with uniform mass distribution. We consider a general model for shape variation that only assumes that every valid instance contains a shape PI while it is contained in another shape PE. We characterize the worst-case displacement of the center of mass in a given direction in terms of PI and PE. The characterization allows us to determine an adequate outer approximation of the locus of the center of mass. We also show that the worst-case displacement is small if PI is convex and fat (that is, not long and thin) and the distance between the boundaries of PE and PI is bounded.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a chip containing a flexible scaffold which facilitates the construction of tissues with different shapes. The chip, entirely made of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), has 2 main components including actuator and channel layers. The actuator layer consists of a 6\u00d76 array of membrane actuators, with round shapes. The channel layer has a single layered structure due to the simplicity in chip assembly and the ability to observe seeded cells via a microscope. The actuator array offers a flat surface, like a normal cell culture dish, in the rest state, while it temporarily offers a scaffold structure when actuators are activated. By changing the actuation pattern, formation of many scaffold structures is possible. To demonstrate the utility of this chip in biological application, a syringe pump is connected to all actuators to produced 2 different scaffolds, enabling the fabrication of multiple flat round and lattice shaped tissues. NIH3T3 cells with the amount of 5\u00d7106 were seeded on the scaffold and kept inside the incubator for 24 hours. The 25 round shaped tissues with an average diameter of 623.87 \u03bcm were simultaneously fabricated when a scaffold with large deformed actuators was used. The lattice shaped tissue with a line width of about 300 \u03bcm was also fabricated with a different scaffold structure which has less actuator displacement. Results suggest the potential usage of this chip for the preparation of many building units with different structures, without the necessity of making a new mold for a new tissue shape.",

        "abstract": "Visual based approach has been studied extensively for on-road vehicle detection, while it faces great challenges, as visual appearance of a vehicle may change greatly across different viewpoints, and partial observation happens sometime due to occlusions from infrastructure or scene dynamics, and/or limited camera vision field. Inspired by the works on part-based detection, this research proposes a probabilistic framework for on-road vehicle detection, where focus is cast on vehicle pose inference on the set of part instances by addressing the issues of partial observation and varying viewpoints. To this end, geometric models describing the configuration of vehicle parts as well as their spatial relations in probabilistic representations are learned for each dominant viewpoint, and viewpoint maps are generated on each typical road structure, which provide probabilistic prediction to the viewpoints of a vehicle at each location at ego frame. Experiments have been conducted using a data set that was developed in the authors' previous work on the ring roads in Beijing. Viewpoint-discriminative part appearance models (VDPAM) and viewpoint-discriminative part-based geometric models (VDPGM) are learned on the image samples of the data set, and the road structure-based probabilistic viewpoint maps (RSPVM) are generated by taking the statistics of the Lidar-based vehicle detection results. On-road vehicle detection is examined using an on-road video stream that has been labelled with ground truth. Experimental results are presented and efficiency on detecting the partially observed vehicles on varying viewpoints is demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "For large-scale and long-term simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), a robot has to deal with unknown initial positioning caused by either the kidnapped robot problem or multi-session mapping. This paper addresses these problems by tying the SLAM system with a global loop closure detection approach, which intrinsically handles these situations. However, online processing for global loop closure detection approaches is generally influenced by the size of the environment. The proposed graph-based SLAM system uses a memory management approach that only consider portions of the map to satisfy online processing requirements. The approach is tested and demonstrated using five indoor mapping sessions of a building using a robot equipped with a laser rangefinder and a Kinect.",

An estimation algorithm using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed for a nonlinear tissue dynamic model, which is investigated in silico as well as in vivo and in situ on porcine models. Results show that while the approach is sensitive to initial conditions, tissue can be identified during the early stage of a typical grasp.",

Based on the resulting kinematic model and joint configurations, the robot is able to select and adapt actions, recognize their successful completion and detect failure. We present an RGB-D-based online algorithm for the interactive perception of articulated objects. The algorithm decomposes the perception problem into three interconnected levels of recursive estimation. The estimation problems at each level are much simpler than the original problem and their robustness is improved by level-specific priors that help reject noise in the measurements. These three estimators mutually inform each other to further improve the convergence properties of the three estimation solutions. We demonstrate that the resulting algorithm is robust, accurate, and versatile in real-world experiments. We also show how the perceptual skill can be used online to control the robot's behavior in real-world manipulation tasks.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we address the problem of accurate trajectory tracking while ensuring compliant robotic behaviour for periodic tasks. We propose an approach for on-line learning of task-specific dynamics, i.e. task specific movement trajectories and corresponding force/torque profiles. The proposed control framework is a multi-step process, where in the first step a human tutor shows how to perform the desired periodic task. A state estimator based on an adaptive frequency oscillator combined with dynamic movement primitives is employed to extract movement trajectories. In the second step, the movement trajectory is accurately executed in the controlled environment under human supervision. In this step, the robot is accurately tracking the acquired movement trajectory, using high feedback gains to ensure accurate tracking. Thus it can learn the corresponding force/torque profiles, i. e. task-specific dynamics. Finally, in the third step, the movement is executed with the learned feedforward task-specific dynamic model, allowing for low position feedback gains, which implies compliant robot behaviour. Thus, it is safe for interaction with humans or the environment. The proposed approach was evaluated on a Kuka LRW robot performing object manipulation and crank turning.",

Loop-closing revisit actions bound the robot's uncertainty but also contribute to redundant area coverage and increased path length.We propose an opportunistic path planner that leverages sampling-based techniques and information filtering for planning revisit paths that are coverage efficient. Our algorithm employs Gaussian Process regression for modeling the prediction of camera registrations and uses a two-step optimization for selecting revisit actions. We show that the proposed method outperforms existing solutions for bounding navigation uncertainty with a hybrid simulation experiment using a real-world dataset collected by a ship hull inspection robot.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the potential of trajectory optimization for unspecified contact sequences as a tool to identify optimal gaits and motions for legged robots. This work is based on a recently proposed method that states the mechanical dynamics in a floating base description, makes the ground contact forces part of the free variable vector, and implements the requirement that a foot is either on the ground or that the corresponding contact force is zero via a set of complimentary conditions. We introduce an algorithmic improvement that uses higher order integration for states that are continuous through collisions and thus increases the accuracy of the obtained solutions. The benefits of the proposed changes are evaluated with the models of a 1D hopper and a 2D bipedal robot, and we additionally compare our results with analytic solutions and an established multiple shooting implementation. The proposed method was able to automatically discover walking and running as the most energetically economic ways of locomotion for a conceptual biped that is moving at different speed. It additionally discovers an elastic walking gait that is used at intermediate velocities.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new methodology to craft navigation functions for nonlinear systems with stochastic uncertainty. The method relies on the transformation of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation into a linear partial differential equation. This approach allows for optimality criteria to be incorporated into the navigation function, and generalizes several existing results in navigation functions. It is shown that the HJB and that existing navigation functions in the literature sit on ends of a spectrum of optimization problems, upon which tradeoffs may be made in problem complexity. In particular, it is shown that under certain criteria the optimal navigation function is related to Laplace's equation, previously used in the literature, through an exponential transform. Further, analytical solutions to the HJB are available in simplified domains, yielding guidance towards optimality for approximation schemes. Examples are used to illustrate the role that noise, and optimality can potentially play in navigation system design.",

We model the object's structure and flexibility by a chain of rigid bodies connected by torsional springs. Unlike previous work, the proposed optimal control approach using variational integrators allows identification of closed loops, which include the robot arm itself. This allows using the resulting models for planning in configuration space of the robot. In order to solve the resulting problem efficiently, we develop a novel method for fast discrete-time adjoint-based gradient calculation. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated using full physics simulation in trep and using data recorded from a 7-DOF series elastic robot arm.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a visibility-based method for planning the motion of a mobile robotic sensor with bounded field-of-view to optimally track a moving target while localizing itself. The target and robot states are estimated from online sensor measurements and a set of a priori known landmarks, using an extended Kalman filter (EKF), and thus the proposed method is applicable to robots without a global positioning system. It is shown that the problem of optimizing the target tracking and robot localization performance is equivalent to optimizing the visibility or probability of detection in the EKF framework under mild assumptions. The control law that maximizes the probability of detection for a robotic sensor with a sector-shaped field-of-view (FoV) is derived as a function of the robot heading and aperture. Simulations have been conducted on synthetic experiments and the results show that the optimized-visibility approach is effective at avoiding target loss, and outperforms a state-of-the-art potential method based on robot trailer models [1].",

        "abstract": "With no initial angular momentum an ordinary house cat is capable of flipping over onto its feet in mid-air and landing safely after a fall. As the field of robotics advances and robots become more dynamic, control algorithms for landing safely from a long, intended fall will become more necessary. Here we present an algorithm that leverages nonholonomic trajectory planning inspired by the falling cat to orient an articulated robot through configuration changes to achieve a pose that reduces the impact at landing. The calculated impact pose results in minimal loss of energy through rolling, while maximizing the rolling time. In addition to orienting and rolling, our controller guides the system to behave like a damped spring-mass system to reduce the magnitude of contact forces. Our framework is general and is applicable to systems that can be modeled as a connected tree of rigid bodies. We illustrate the feasibility of the algorithm through simulation and physical experiments with a planar three-link robot.",

The selected design can generate twisting and bending motions by pulling, pushing, or torsional force applied to the origami structure. Thread-based actuation also enables various shapes and motions by using different numbers of threads and routing them through different paths. The kinematics for each twisting and bending motions based on estimated parameters is derived. To evaluate potential use of origami for real-world applications and identify structural weaknesses, preliminary stiffness and durability testing was conducted. For physical demonstrations of robotic manipulation and locomotion, OrigamiBot-I was equipped with four independently-routed threads, where each thread is controlled by a geared DC motor. The robot successfully demonstrated its simple manipulation and locomotion capabilities.",

        "abstract": "We present the first decentralized multi-copter flock that performs stable autonomous outdoor flight with up to 10 flying agents. By decentralized and autonomous we mean that all members navigate themselves based on the dynamic information received from other robots in the vicinity. We do not use central data processing or control; instead, all the necessary computations are carried out by miniature on-board computers. The only global information the system exploits is from GPS receivers, while the units use wireless modules to share this positional information with other flock members locally. Collective behavior is based on a decentralized control framework with bio-inspiration from statistical physical modelling of animal swarms. In addition, the model is optimized for stable group flight even in a noisy, windy, delayed and error-prone environment. Using this framework we successfully implemented several fundamental collective flight tasks with up to 10 units: i) we achieved self-propelled flocking in a bounded area with self-organized object avoidance capabilities and ii) performed collective target tracking with stable formation flights (grid, rotating ring, straight line). With realistic numerical simulations we demonstrated that the local broadcast-type communication and the decentralized autonomous control method allows for the scalability of the model for much larger flocks.",

        "abstract": "Visual odometry is typically formulated as a descriptor-based image feature tracking problem, followed by outlier rejection and simultaneous estimation of the scene structure and camera motion. We propose a fundamentally different formulation for the stereo case: a multi-scale search over pose to estimate the transformation that best aligns two sparse point clouds in image space. This has three main consequences. First, data association is descriptorless and implicit, supporting the use of features with indistinct appearance, such as edge features. Second, outlier rejection is subsumed by the use of a robust kernel and a joint feature alignment objective. Third, the method is robust to local minima, in contrast to coarse-to-fine or iterative approaches. This paper details the proposed method, which we call Perspective Alignment Search (PAS), integrated into an edge feature visual odometry system, and an evaluation against a LIDAR-based SLAM solution.",

        "abstract": "Active force control of an industrial robot with an end-effector force/torque sensor effectively handles compliant industrial tasks like assembly operations, surface finishing jobs, cooperative manipulation, etc. However, the robot still remains intrinsically unsafe for dynamically changing environment where the chances of the links coming in contact with the environment exists. This paper proposes a scheme for active force control at the end-effector using a six-component force/torque sensor through external force-control loop along with steady-state error compensator. In parallel, passive joint compliance was achieved by limiting the currents to joint motors based on an identified model of the robot under study. The proposed method was implemented on a KUKA KR5 ARC industrial robot and tested for passive compliance by colliding with another moving robot in its workspace. Active force control was tested to maintain a desired force on contact to demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller.",

We present a method to control the motion and a subset of the contact forces of a floating-base robot. We derive a new formulation of the lexicographic optimization problem typically arising in multi-task motion/force control frameworks. The structure of the constraints of the problem (i.e. the dynamics of the robot) allows us to find a sparse analytical solution. This leads to an equivalent optimization with reduced computational complexity, comparable to inverse-dynamics based approaches. At the same time, our method preserves the flexibility of optimization based control frameworks. Simulations were carried out to achieve different multi-contact behaviors on a 23-degree-of-freedom humanoid robot, validating the presented approach. A comparison with another state-of-the-art control technique with similar computational complexity shows the benefits of our controller, which can eliminate force/torque discontinuities.",

In this paper, we introduce a partially analytical EI shaper which is a closed form using one parameter for a specific damping ratio \u03b6 and vibration tolerance Vtol. The validity of the partially analytical EI shaper is demonstrated by simulation and experimental studies using a flexible up-and-down motion control system.",

The conventional wheel odometry method uses orientation measurements to assume a momentary plane to apply wheel encoder readings. On uneven terrains, this method often gives poor results for position tracking, and therefore rarely used. To improve the conventional odometry motion model, immediate terrain data can be used. This paper proposes a novel state variable extension (SVE) method to establish a connection between state space variables of a terrain rover by combining terrain point clouds with rover kinematics. The simulation results show that when the 2D state variables (x, y, yaw) are known, the 2D state can be extended to its 3D state (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw) with minimal error. The proposed SVE method is employed in a particle filter to determine the 2D state variables, which in turn results in achieving the full 3D position tracking of the rover.",

We then conduct gait analysis through numerical simulations to observe how small oscillation of the leg frames affects the gait properties, and show that speeding-up is achieved by utilizing the indirect softness produced by the dynamic absorbers. Second, we investigate the dominant effect of small oscillation using the same model. The simulation results show high nonlinearity in the generated walking gait.",

A novel probabilistic stability criterion derived from the cumulative distribution of a tip-over metric is introduced that allows a safety constraint to be dynamically updated by available sensor data as it becomes available. The proposed safety constraint authorizes the planner to generates more conservative motion plans for areas with higher levels of uncertainty, while avoids unnecessary caution in well-known areas. The proposed systematic approach is particularly applicable to reconfigurable robots that can assume safer postures when required, although is equally valid for fixed-configuration platforms to choose safer paths to follow. The advantages of planning with the proposed probabilistic stability metric are demonstrated with data collected from an indoor rescue arena, as well as an outdoor rover testing facility.",

Unlike the prior approaches using the hip-joint as the root of forward kinematic model, a foot-rooted kinematic model is developed in this work. A state change mechanism has also been investigated to allow dynamically switching the root of kinematic trees between the left and the right foot. Benefitted from this, full-body motions can be well captured in our system as long as there is at least one static foot in the movement. The \u2018floating\u2019 artifact of hip-joint rooted methods has been eliminated in our approach, and more complicated motions such as climbing stairs can be successfully captured in real-time. Comparing to those vision-based systems, this IMU-based system provides more flexibility on capturing outdoor motions that are important for many robotic applications.",

        "abstract": "Why is pedestrian detection still very challenging in realistic scenes? How much would a successful solution to monocular depth inference aid pedestrian detection? In order to answer these questions we trained a state-of-the-art deformable parts detector using different configurations of optical images and their associated 3D point clouds, in conjunction and independently, leveraging upon the recently released KITTI dataset. We propose novel strategies for depth upsampling and contextual fusion that together lead to detection performance which exceeds that of the RGB-only systems. Our results suggest depth cues as a very promising mid-level target for future pedestrian detection approaches.",

This paper considers the problem of a persistent monitoring mission using multiple autonomous gliders and exploiting thermal soaring. Communications constraints and non-homogeneous teams of gliders are considered. A distributed method based on coordination variables is proposed to monitor the area in a cooperative manner by following a partitioning patrolling strategy. A distributed one-to-one coordination technique is used to manage the gliders' access to thermals according to their states and known thermal locations. Gliders perform a model-based estimation about their energy losses between thermals to estimate the optimal time to remain in a thermal to maintain persistent surveillance with minimum refresh time. Simulated test results are provided to evaluate how the proposed approach is able to extend the mission while maintaining near-optimal performance.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Following recent works on HRI for UAVs, we present a gesture recognition system which operates on the video stream recorded from a passive monocular camera installed on a quadcopter. While many challenges must be addressed for building a real-time vision-based gestural interface, in this paper we specifically focus on the problem of user personalization. Different users tend to perform the same gesture with different styles and speed. Thus, a system trained on visual sequences depicting some users may work poorly when data from other people are available. On the other hand, collecting and annotating many user-specific data is time consuming. To avoid these issues, in this paper we propose a personalized gestural interface. We introduce a novel transfer learning algorithm which, exploiting both data downloaded from the web and gestures collected from other users, permits to learn a set of person-specific classifiers. We integrate the proposed gesture recognition module into a HRI system with a flying quadrotor robot. In our system first the UAV localizes a person and individuates her identity. Then, when a user performs a specific gesture, the system recognizes it adopting the associated user-specific classifier and the quadcopter executes the corresponding task. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed personalized gesture recognition solution is advantageous with respect to generic ones.",

        "abstract": "Biped walking is sensitive to large perturbation because of the limited foothold and unstable nature. This paper proposed a strategy of dynamic updating the footstep for humanoid robots to recover their balance from an unexpected perturbation with one step. The proposed strategy consists of a desired footstep calculator and a swing leg controller. The desired footstep calculator consists of three stages: perturbation detection, rapid adaption, and capturabililty inspection. In the perturbation detection stage, the acceleration and the jerk of the pelvis are used to detect whether the perturbation occurs. In the rapid adaption stage, the robot modifies the desired step location quickly according to the integration of the changed acceleration during the perturbation. In the capturability inspection stage, capture region is calculated to inspect whether the desired foot step is inside the capture region. The swing leg controller is to generate the joint trajectories and torques of the swing leg based on the desired footstep online. Simulations of walking of a 12-DOF humanoid robot show that the proposed method is effective in recovering its balance even when it is perturbed from different directions by an impulse of 20 [Ns].",

        "abstract": "The influence of holding hands on the relationship building process between children and robots is investigated in this study. In particular, at the first meeting, it is difficult for a child to be open if he/she starts to rebuff the robot partner. This significantly degrades the possibility of the child forming a friendship relationship with the robot. Thus, the initial approach of the robot to the child in the early stage of the relationship building process should be appropriate. We hypothesize that physical embodied communication, such as walking hand in hand, improves the relationship between children and robots. A holding hands system was implemented in a real robot, and an experiment was conducted at a kindergarten to validate our hypothesis. The results strongly support our hypothesis.",

        "abstract": "We describe an accurate approach to state estimation which fuses any available sensor data with physical consistency priors. This is done by combining the advantages of recursive estimation and fixed-lag smoothing: at each step we re-estimate the trajectory over a time window into the past, but also use a recursive prior obtained from the previous time step via internal simulation. We also incorporate a physics engine into the estimator, which makes it possible to adjust the state estimates so that the inferred contact interactions are consistent with the observed accelerations. The estimator can utilize contact sensors to improve accuracy, but even in the absence of such sensors it reasons correctly about contact forces. Estimation speed and accuracy are demonstrated on a 28-DOF humanoid robot (Darwin) in a walking task. Timing tests and leave-one-out cross-validation show that the proposed approach can be used in real-time and is substantially more accurate than the EKF, without any over-fitting.

State-of-the-art approaches use machine learning techniques that require extensive and often time consuming training. This work proposes a novel formulation by posing place categorization as an efficient \u21131-minimization problem, leading to both a faster training phase and to performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. The formulation allows online robot operation particularly in the case when the training phase has to be learned on-the-fly and in an active manner. To validate the performance of the proposed method, extensive experimental results carried out on real data under different lighting conditions as well as structural changes in the environment are provided.",

        "abstract": "We present a robot self-localization approach that is based on using a cascade of filters that increasingly refine a robot's guess regarding where it is in a hallway system. The location refinement carried out by each stage of the cascade compares a signature extracted from a stereo pair of camera images taken at the current location of the robot with a database of such signatures collected previously during a training phase. A central question in this approach to robot localization is what signatures to use for each stage of the cascade. An answer to this question must recognize the special importance of the first stage of the cascade \u2014 we refer to this as the prefiltering stage. The signature used for prefiltering must be significantly viewpoint invariant, while possessing sufficient locale uniqueness to yield a set of possible locations for the robot that includes the true location with a high probability. On the other hand, the signature(s) used for downstream filtering in the cascade must then prune away the inapplicable locales from the list yielded by the prefilter. What that implies is that the downstream filters must be increasingly viewpoint variant and locale specific. Although the framework we propose allows for an arbitrary number of filters to follow the prefiltering stage, the results we present in this paper are for a two-stage cascade consisting of a prefilter followed by one additional filter. The signatures we use in our experiments are based on 3D-JUDOCA features that can be extracted from stereo pairs of images. The proposed framework for choosing the best signatures for the prefiltering stage and the filtering stage that follows was tested in a large indoor hallway system with a total linear length of 1539 m. The validation results we show are based on a dataset of 6209 stereo images collected by a robot from the hallways during its training phase. The performance evaluation presented in this paper demonstrates that our framework can lead to hi... Show More",

        "abstract": "Segmentation and mapping of planar building facades (PBFs) can increase a robot's ability of scene understanding and localization in urban environments which are often quasi-rectilinear and GPS-challenged. PBFs are basic components of the quasi-rectilinear environment. We propose a passive vision-based PBF segmentation and mapping algorithm by combining both appearance and geometric constraints. We propose a rectilinear index which allows us to segment out planar regions using appearance data. Then we combine geometric constraints such as reprojection errors, orientation constraints, and coplanarity constraints in an optimization process to improve the mapping of PBFs. We have implemented the algorithm and tested it in comparison with state-of-the-art. The results show that our method can reduce the angular error of scene structure by an average of 82.82%.",

        "abstract": "In this article, we address the pose estimation for planar motion under the framework of generalized camera models. We assume the knowledge of the coordinates of 3D straight lines in the world coordinate system. Pose is estimated using the images of the 3D lines. This approach does not require the determination of correspondences between pixels and 3D world points. Instead, and for each pixel, it is only required that we determine to which 3D line it is associated with. Instead of identifying individual pixels, it is only necessary to establish correspondences between the pixels that belong to the images of the 3D lines, and the 3D lines. Moreover and using the assumption that the motion is planar, this paper presents a novel method for the computation of the pose using general imaging devices and assuming the knowledge of the coordinates of 3D straight lines. The approach is evaluated and validated using both synthetic data and real images. The experiments are performed using a mobile robot equipped with a non-central camera.",

The state transition can be formulated in the centroid acceleration space whose diagram is defined as a \u201ctriangle of sliding friction.\u201d The triangle of sliding friction's characteristics are explained by focusing on comparison with the cone of friction, which has a similar state decision diagram. Moreover, the behavioral simulation of a concrete model 2-DOF biped robot is used to analyze the sliding features in terms of the asymmetry of the dynamics of both legs.",

This paper presents a local trajectory planner, based on a simplified dynamic model of quadrotors, which fits the requirements to be integrated into a global motion planning approach. It relies on a closed-form solution to compute curves in the kinodynamic state space that tend to minimize the flying time. These curves have suitable continuity properties and guarantee respect of physical limits of the system (i.e. bounds for the time-derivatives of the pose coordinates). The paper explains how this local planner can be used within different motion planning approaches that enable the treatment of difficult problems in constrained environments.",

For example when dealing with occlusions (or other constraints such as joint limits) in a classical visual servoing loop, or also in the more advanced model predictive control schemes recently proposed in the literature. Several possibilities have been proposed to perform the initial correction step for then propagating the visual features by exploiting the measurements currently available by the camera. But the predictions proposed so far are inaccurate in situations where the depths of the tracked points are not correctly estimated. We then propose in this paper a new correction strategy which tries to directly correct the relative pose between the camera and the target instead of only adjusting the error on the image plane. This correction is then analysed and compared by evaluating the corresponding improvements in the feature prediction phase.",

        "abstract": "Tracking whole-body human pose in physical human-machine interactions such as bicycling is challenging because of highly-dimensional human motions and lack of inexpensive, effective motion sensors in outdoor environment. In this paper, we present a computational scheme to estimate the whole-body pose in human-machine interaction with application to the rider-bicycle system. The estimation scheme is built on the fusions of gyroscopes, accelerometers and force sensors with six Extended Kalman filter designs. The use of physical human-machine interaction constraints further helps to eliminate the integration drifts of inertial sensors measurements and also to reduce the number of the inertial sensors for whole-body pose estimation. For each set of upper- and lower-limb, only one tri-axial gyroscope is needed to accurately obtain the pose information. The performance of the drift-free, reliable estimation scheme is demonstrated through both the indoor and outdoor bicycle riding experiments. The proposed approach can be further extended to other types of physical human-machine interactions.",

The method utilizes only the velocity information of each caster unit and recursively estimates the pose of the caster units by the extended Kalman filter. In the state estimation problem, the estimation performance depends on the quality of the input signals. The input signals must contain sufficiently rich information to appropriately estimate the states. Since the system controlled by servo brakes is driven by a user-applied force, the user can arbitrarily select the input signals of velocity information. Therefore, we also suggest a simple pattern that enables users to provide sufficiently rich information for relationship estimates. Finally, the proposed method is validated in a computer simulation and an experiment using a mobile robot platform equipped with double-wheel caster units.",

        "abstract": "The implementation of lightweight robot concepts requires novel measurement and control strategies to deal with the flexibility of the robot arm. To the authors' best knowledge this paper introduces for the first time an innovative closed-loop concept to measure and control the absolute position of the tool center point (TCP) based on a synthetic aperture wireless localization approach. A radio-frequency identification (RFID)-like backscatter transponder is attached to the TCP, and several radar base stations measure the respective roundtrip time-of-flight and phase of the backscattered transponder signals. Inverse radar apertures are synthesized based on a small movement of the TCP. The small TCP trajectory is tracked with simple relative sensors. A holographic synthetic aperture reconstruction algorithm then determines the absolute TCP position - i.e., the trajectory coordinates in the world coordinate system. This absolute positional information is used to observe the control system and identify model errors, which are minimized in a closed-loop procedure. This iteratively improves both the system model and control quality as well as the precision of the synthetic aperture wireless localization. System simulations and first test results prove that the novel concept is suited to measure and control the position of an end-effector with mm-precision, even if the initial system model is partly erroneous.",

To perform tasks that require multiple contacts, like manipulation or crawling, the controller allows the robot to use a subset of its end effectors to apply a desired wrench to the environment. The remaining end effectors are used for balancing while taking into account the wrenches originating from the manipulation. Due to the prediction the controller is able to react to changes in the control inputs in advance. This approach is evaluated in simulation with the humanoid robot TORO.",

However the energy consumption remains a major technological limitation and its usual flight autonomy is only 15 to 20 minutes. More and more platforms deriving from that concept come out. For example terrestrial quadrotors have already appeared on the market. They can move on the ground to save energy and fly to avoid obstacles. It is proposed in this paper to study control laws for one particular design of terrestrial quadrotor. A terrestrial dynamic model of the system is first presented and then validated by an identification process relying on results recorded by an experimental platform also described in the present document.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel vision-aided navigation approach that continuously estimates precise 3D absolute pose for aerial vehicles, using only inertial measurements and monocular camera observations. Our approach is able to provide accurate navigation solutions under long-term GPS outage, by tightly incorporating absolute geo-registered information into two kinds of visual measurements: 2D-3D tie-points, and geo-registered feature tracks. 2D-3D tie-points are established by finding feature correspondences to align an aerial video frame to a 2D geo-referenced image rendered from the 3D terrain database. These measurements provide global information to correct accumulated error in navigation estimation. Geo-registered feature tracks are generated by associating features across consecutive frames. They enable the propagation of 3D geo-referenced values to further improve the pose estimation. All sensor measurements are fully optimized in a smoother-based inference framework, which achieves efficient relinearization and real-time estimation of navigation states and their covariances over a constant-length of sliding window. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach provides accurate and consistent aerial navigation solutions on several large-scale GPS-denied scenarios.",

One example application is the treatment of osteolysis (bone degradation) due to total hip arthroplasty. Recent literature suggest constant curvature models to define manipulator configuration from string (or actuator cable) length; however, our manipulator does not conform to constant curvature bending. In this paper, we present a two-step model to predict the kinematic configuration directly from string length with no assumptions regarding constant curvature bending. We experimentally identify the model parameters and validate the model on an additional experimental data set. The results indicate our model achieved an average maximum error of 1.0 \u00b1 0.90mm in predicting manipulator configuration compared to the ground truth over the test data set.",

The similarity between these distributions is computed using a kernel function. The contact distributions are then classified using kernel logistic regression. The proposed approach was used to predict stable grasps of an elongated object, as well as to construct towers out of assorted toy blocks.",

        "abstract": "A key component of robotic path planning for monitoring dynamic events is reliable navigation to the right place at the right time. For persistent monitoring applications (e.g., over months), marine robots are beginning to make use of the environment for propulsion, instead of depending on traditional motors and propellers. These vehicles are able to realize dramatically higher endurance by exploiting wave and wind energy, however the path planning problem becomes difficult as the vehicle speed is no longer directly controllable. In this paper, we examine Gaussian process models to predict the speed of the Wave Glider autonomous surface vehicle from observable environmental parameters. Using training data from an on-board sensor, and wave parameter forecasts from the WAVEWATCH III model, our probabilistic regression models create an effective method for predicting Wave Glider speed for use in a variety of path planning applications.",

For the generation of smooth feet trajectories, we present a new approach based on rigid body interpolation, enhanced by adaptive step correction. Finally, we present a sensor fusion approach for sensor-based state estimation and an effective solution to sensors' noise, delay, and bias issues, as well as to errors induced by the simplified dynamics and actuation imperfections. Our formulation is applied on a real NAO humanoid robot, where it achieves real-time onboard execution and yields smooth and stable gaits.",

However, achieving this goal requires the prosthesis to adapt to walking speed, a function that no powered transfemoral prosthesis has yet achieved. In this paper, we present, and perform initial testing on a new control framework that allows biologically accurate leg function at varying walking speeds, without the need for tuning. The proposed framework comprises two novel controllers that rely on quasi-stiffness modulation in stance phase and minimum jerk trajectory in swing phase. Preliminary testing was conducted in an able-bodied subject using a bypass adapter to walk on a robotic prosthesis at five different walking speeds (from 0.62 to 1.16 m/s). Experimental results demonstrated the ability of the proposed controller to approximate intact leg function at different walking speeds.",

The results of the evaluations reveal that the system statistically significantly improves surgical precision (p < 0.01) with only a small increase in operating time. The force data recorded also reveals that operating force can be significantly affected by ergonomic factors, and that warnings for excessive force and workspace limits are needed.",

The controller was developed using the method of virtual constraints, a control design method first used on the planar point-feet robots Rabbit and MABEL. For the preliminary experiments reported here, virtual constraints were experimentally tuned to achieve robust planar walking and then 3D walking. A key feature of the controller leading to successful 3D walking is the particular choice of virtual constraints in the lateral plane, which implement a lateral balance control strategy similar to SIMBICON. To our knowledge, MARLO is the most highly underactuated bipedal robot to walk unassisted in 3D.",

Visualizing the aforementioned performance specifications as error bounds, the key idea is to provide an error transformation that converts the original constrained problem into an equivalent unconstrained one, the stabilization of which proves sufficient to achieve prescribed performance guarantees and satisfy the inherent visibility constraints. The performance of the developed scheme is a priori and explicitly imposed by certain designer-specified performance functions, and is fully decoupled by the control gains selection, thus simplifying the control design. Moreover, its computational complexity proves significantly low. It is actually a static scheme involving very few and simple calculations to output the control signal, which enables easily its implementation on fast embedded control platforms. Finally, real-time experiments using an eye-in-hand robotic system verify the theoretical findings.",

In this paper we describe the development and testing of a simplified, versatile method for modeling the stress on a flexure hinge under multi-axis loads in order to maximize hinge lifespan. We also discuss other stress concentration reducing features and design rules that can be applied to more general flexure hinge designs to further extend hinge lifespan.",

The method makes two contributions. First, we identify five priors, each capturing structure inherent to the physical world that is relevant to the search problem. Second, we propose a formalization of the object search problem that leverages these priors. Our formalization in form of a probabilistic graphical model is capable of combining the various sources of information into a consistent probability distribution over object locations. The formalization allows us to sharpen the distribution by propagating the knowledge across locations. We employ the reasoning method to select actions of a searching robot in a simulated environment and show that it results in more efficient object search.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for robot navigation in crowded urban environments where people and objects are moving simultaneously while a robot is navigating. Avoiding moving obstacles at their corresponding precise moment motivates the use of a robotic planner satisfying both dynamic and nonholonomic constraints, also referred as kynodynamic constraints.We present a proactive navigation approach with respect its environment, in the sense that the robot calculates the reaction produced by its actions and provides the minimum impact on nearby pedestrians. As a consequence, the proposed planner integrates seamlessly planning and prediction and calculates a complete motion prediction of the scene for each robot propagation. Making use of the Extended Social Force Model (ESFM) allows an enormous simplification for both the prediction model and the planning system under differential constraints. Simulations and real experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the success of the proactive kinodynamic planner.",

Using an inhomogeneous Markov chain, each agent determines its target position during each iteration in a statistically independent manner while the distributed system converges to the desired formation. Moreover, the distributed system is robust to external disturbances or damages to the formation. Once the target positions are assigned, an optimal control problem is formulated to ensure that the agents reach the target positions while avoiding collisions. This problem is solved using sequential convex programming to determine optimal, collision-free trajectories and model predictive control is implemented to update these trajectories as new state information becomes available. Finally, we validate the probabilistic guidance of distributed systems and model predictive control algorithms using the formation flying testbed.",

It is more powerful than geometric planning and can be solved more efficiently than planning with full robot dynamics. We present a probabilistically complete RRT motion planner that considers joint acceleration limits and potentially non-zero start and goal velocities. It uses a fast, non-iterative steering method. We demonstrate both the power and efficiency of our planner using the problem of hitting a nail with a hammer, which requires the robot to reach a given goal velocity while avoiding obstacles. Our planner is able to solve this problem in less than 100 ms. In contrast, a purely geometric planner is unable to hit the nail at the desired velocity, whereas a standard kinodynamic RRT is multiple orders of magnitude slower.",

A stack-based domain specific language (DSL) is introduced for object repositioning tasks, and a learning algorithm is proposed to synthesize a program in this DSL based on human demonstrations. Once the synthesized program has been learned, it can be rapidly verified and refined in the simulator via further demonstrations if necessary, then finally executed on an actual robot to accomplish the corresponding learned tasks in the physical world. By performing demonstrations on a novel tablet interface, the time required for teaching is greatly reduced compared with using a real robot. Experiments show a variety of object repositioning tasks such as sorting, kitting, and packaging can be programmed using this approach.",

Both parties are represented by normal distributions that evolve according to a Kalman filter as new sensor readings (observation from overhead camera/satellite images) are obtained. The objective is to design the control commands issued by the pursuer (which is executed noisily). The control commands issued by the evader are unknown - only sensor measurements are given. Even with such limited knowledge we prove boundedness of a distance between the pursuer's distribution and the evader's true distribution (one that takes into account the evader's control commands). Our simulation results support the claimed guarantees.",

For human the in-hand manipulation is an easy work; for robots it is still a challenge. One of its issues lies in the uncertainty of the interaction state. This paper researches robot object interaction from a novel angle, the method is called haptic exploration, which helps robots acquire the ability to explore the object in hand. For in-hand manipulation task, the haptic exploration is a process where the robot hand perceives contact force feedback from slightly push along different directions. In order to describe the force feedback, two definitions are given: pushable direction and push resistance. Additionally, a single finger push model and spatial multi-finger push model are proposed to illustrate push resistance. Furthermore an object push strategy is presented to reduce the number of push directions. At last real robot experiments are conducted to verify the proposed models. And its result also shows the feasibility of haptic exploration method.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper introduces a bounding gait control algorithm that allows a successful implementation of duty cycle modulation in the MIT Cheetah 2. Instead of controlling leg stiffness to emulate a \u2018springy leg\u2019 inspired from the Spring-Loaded-Inverted-Pendulum (SLIP) model, the algorithm prescribes vertical impulse by generating scaled ground reaction forces at each step to achieve the desired stance and total stride duration. Therefore, we can control the duty cycle: the percentage of the stance phase over the entire cycle. By prescribing the required vertical impulse of the ground reaction force at each step, the algorithm can adapt to variable duty cycles attributed to variations in running speed. Following linear momentum conservation law, in order to achieve a limit-cycle gait, the sum of all vertical ground reaction forces must match vertical momentum created by gravity during a cycle. In addition, we added a virtual compliance control in the vertical direction to enhance stability. The stiffness of the virtual compliance is selected based on the eigenvalue analysis of the linearized Poincar\u00e9 map and the chosen stiffness is 700 N/m, which corresponds to around 12% of the stiffness used in the previous trotting experiments of the MIT Cheetah, where the ground reaction forces are purely caused by the impedance controller with equilibrium point trajectories. This indicates that the virtual compliance control does not significantly contributes to generating ground reaction forces, but to stability. The experimental results show that the algorithm successfully prescribes the duty cycle for stable bounding gaits. This new approach can shed a light on variable speed running control algorithm.",

To solve the problem, we also propose a basic framework and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulation. This framework allows one to use a scalar coefficient to adjust the trade-off between stability and energy use. The optimal scalar value depends on the robot, terrain, task and priorities. In order to implement the methods in this paper, multiple low-level walking controllers and meshing of a ten-dimensional state space are needed. This latter requirement would normally be impractical for a 10D system; however, we exploit the observation that our low-level controllers cause the step-to-step dynamics to fill only a small, quasi-2D region, thus enabling meshing and, correspondingly, dynamic programming based on the resulting Markov Decision Process (MDP). Both the introduction of the energy/stability trade-off problem and our proposed framework for its solution have potential for significant utility in the future, as robot locomotion is developed to operate in increasingly less structured (stochastic) environments.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of manipulating a planar elastic rod using robotic grippers which grasp the rod at multiple points. Building upon previous work that considers a rod held only at its ends, we show that manipulating a rod held by n + 1 grippers is equivalent to planning a path on a smooth 3n-dimensional manifold. Using multiple grippers can be advantageous when manipulating around obstacles. We establish upper and lower bounds on the number of grippers needed for an equilibrium shape of the rod to pass between obstacles in a desired way. Finally, we consider manipulation planning when both ends of the rod are held fixed, and only the grippers located along the interior of the rod can move.",

        "abstract": "Accurate localization is a problem in environments such as tunnels or pipes due to the hostile conditions, dimensions and the general lack of distinctive visual and/or structural features. Standard indoor localization techniques (e.g. visual SLAM) do not work well in pipelines given the lack of exploitable visual features, while outdoor techniques (GPS in particular) do not work inside metal pipes. In this paper, we present a RF odometry-like method to localize a robot along a pipe. Using a radio-frequency signal transmitter and a receiver, we propose and implement the complete setup in order to obtain periodic received-signal fadings and base a localization system on the periodicity of these fadings. There are two main advantages of the proposed system. First, the sensors are easy to install and can be used with any (ground, aerial) robot. Second, the fadings obtained are periodic, avoiding cumulative errors in localization.",

We propose a setup with two RGB-D cameras that covers the need for conflicting requirements regarding localization, obstacle avoidance, object search and recognition, and gesture recognition. We show that this setup provides sufficient data to enable navigation at homes and we present how ROS modules can be configured to use virtual RGB-D scans instead of laser data for operation in real-time (10Hz). Finally, we present first results of exploiting this versatile setup for a home service robot that picks up things from the floor to prevent potential falls of its future users.",

We observe that untrained users can immediately exploit tactile and physical intuition when controlling the puppet to perform complex actions the target robot. The key contribution of this paper is a build procedure that embeds standardized encoder modules into scaled-down CAD models of the robot links, which are then 3D printed and assembled. This procedure is generalizable to variety of robots, and parts cost approximately seventeen dollars per link. We also present a simple software tool for fast calibration of the puppet-robot mapping, and a safety filtering procedure that sanitizes the noisy inputs so that the robot avoids collisions and satisfies dynamic constraints. A prototype ROBOPuppet is built for a 6DOF industrial manipulator and tested in simulation and on the physical robot.",

The objective is to compute strategies trading off safety for speed to maximize the probability of reaching a given set of target locations within a pre-assigned temporal deadline. We formulate this problem using the theory of Constrained Markov Decision Processes and we show that thanks to this framework it is possible to determine deploying strategies maximizing the probability of success while satisfying the deadline. Moreover, the formulation allows to exactly compute the failure probability of complex deployment tasks. Simulation results illustrate how the proposed method works in different scenarios and show how informed decisions can be made regarding the size of the robot team.",

The presence of robot ego noise, however, makes accurately analyzing music more difficult. In this paper, we focus on the task of learning musical beats, which are often identifiable to humans even in noisy environments such as bars. Learning beats would not only help robots to synchronize their responses to music, but could lead to learning other aspects of musical audio, such as other repeated events, timbrel aspects, and more. We introduce a novel algorithm utilizing stacked spectrograms, in which each column contains frequency bins from multiple instances in time, as well as Probabilistic Latent Component Analysis (PLCA) to learn beats in noisy audio. The stacked spectrograms are exploited to find time-varying spectral characteristics of acoustic components, and PLCA is used to learn and separate the components and find those containing beats. We demonstrate that this system can learn musical beats even when only provided with a few seconds of noisy audio.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Mobile robots are being employed far more often in extreme environments, such as urban search and rescue, with greater levels of autonomy; yet recent studies on field robotics show that numerous failure modes affect the reliability of the robot in meeting mission objectives. Therefore, fault tolerance is increasingly important for field robots operating in unpredictable environments to ensure safety and effectiveness of the system. This paper demonstrates a self-adaptation framework, ReFrESH, that contains mechanisms for fault detection and fault mitigation. The goal of ReFrESH is to provide diagnosable and maintainable infrastructure support, built into a real-time operating system, to manage task performance in the presence of unexpected uncertainties. ReFrESH augments the port-based object framework by attaching evaluation and estimation mechanisms to each functional component so that the robot can easily detect and locate faults. In conjunction, a task level decision mechanism interacts with the fault detection elements in order to generate and choose an optimal approach to mitigating faults. Moreover, to increase flexibility of the fault tolerance, ReFrESH provides self-adaptation support for both software and hardware functionality. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to support both software and hardware self-adaptation. A demonstrative application of ReFrESH illustrates its applicability through a target tracking task deployed on a mobile robot system.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Recently, intrinsically elastic joints became increasingly popular due to several reasons. Most importantly, elasticity improves impact robustness and, if used wisely, energy efficiency. Potential energy storage and release capabilities in the joints allow to outperform rigid manipulators by means of achievable peak link velocity. It has therefore been of great interest to find explosive or cyclic motions, similar to those of humans or animals, that make systematic use of joint elasticity. In this context, we address two important control problems in the present paper. First, we find all potential system states that a visco-elastic joint with constrained deflection may reach from its equilibrium state and analyze the influence of system parameters on the according reachable set. While high link velocities are certainly desirable in terms of performance, they may also increase the robot's level of dangerousness and/or the risk of self damage during potentially unforeseen collisions. Thus, we tackle the problem of how to brake a visco-elastic joint in minimum time. Furthermore, the results are extended to a near-optimal real-time control law for elastic n-DOF manipulators. The proposed braking controller is experimentally verified on a KUKA/DLR LWR4 in joint impedance control.",

        "abstract": "An essential aspect for making robots succeed in real-world environments is to give them the ability to robustly perform motions in continuously changing situations. Classical motion planning methods usually create plans for static environments. The direct execution of such plans in dynamic environments often becomes problematic. We present an approach that adapts motion plans by feeding changes of the environment into a transformation of the plan in task space. Furthermore, the progress in the plan is defined with a phase variable that is updated adaptively according to the actual task progress. This phase variable releases the strict time compliance that many motion planning methods bring along. The main benefit of our approach is the ability to do this adaptation in a computational efficient manner during the execution of the motion. Thus, the gap between the motion planning and motion execution stage is bridged by continuously transforming geometric and dynamic features of a reference plan to the current situation. We evaluate the performance of our approach by comparing it to alternative methods such as dynamic motion primitives and continuous replanning on several simulated benchmark tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate the real robot applicability on a PR2 robot platform.",

A key to this success can also be seen in the increased kinematic adaptability due to the fourth rotational joint in the bio-inspired leg kinematics. An extended experimental evaluation shows that the reactive posture behaviors are able to create an effective and efficient locomotion in challenging environments.",

We concurrently solve the problems of dynamic task assignment and reactive planning in a centralized fashion, allowing goal reassignment as needed in response to changes in the environment. To this end, we model the team of robots as a switched system whose various modes must be activated to satisfy high-level specifications, and describe a formal framework for synthesizing switching protocols for this system. The robots' continuous dynamics under a specific task allocation, as well as their operating environment, are encoded as formulas on a discrete abstraction, in the GR(1) fragment of linear temporal logic. The synthesized protocols ensure that the multi-robot task is fulfilled even in adversarial environments, and the presented abstraction provides a significant computational improvement over previous approaches. We illustrate these ideas in simulation, with applications to intrusion detection and surveillance.",

Real-time video processing is performed in hardware logic by extracting the moment features and bounding boxes of multiple cells in 512\u00d7256-pixel images at 2000 fps. The extracted cell regions are pushed into a first-in-first-out (FIFO) buffer for real-time image-based morphological analysis after being shrunk proportionally to a certain size. By extracting the bounding boxes of the cell regions using hardware logic and shrinking the cell region to a certain size to reduce processing time, our high-speed vision system can perform fast morphological analysis of cells at 2 ms/cell in fast microchannel flows. The results of real-time experiments conducted to analyze the size, eccentricity, and transparency of fertilized sea urchin eggs fast flowing in microchannels verify the efficacy of our vision-based cell analysis system.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a real time 3D SLAM system for texture-less scenes using only the depth information provided by a low cost RGB-D sensor. The proposed registration method is based on a novel informative sampling scheme that is able to extract the points carrying the most useful information from two consecutive frames. Those points are assigned 3D feature descriptors and matched with their correspondences from the other frame. A robust estimator is then used to refine the matches and estimate a rigid transformation between the frames. A global pose for the camera and associated 3D position of the points are computed by concatenating the relative transformations and a map is constructed. As a result, we are able to achieve very accurate registration in real-time using the sparse keypoints. Experimental evaluations show that our proposed method outperforms the state of the art registration algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency.",

However, such depth information can be limited by the sensors, leaving large areas in the visual images where depth is unavailable. Here, we propose a method to utilize the depth, even if sparsely available, in recovery of camera motion. In addition, the method utilizes depth by triangulation from the previously estimated motion, and salient visual features for which depth is unavailable. The core of our method is a bundle adjustment that refines the motion estimates in parallel by processing a sequence of images, in a batch optimization. We have evaluated our method in three sensor setups, one using an RGB-D camera, and two using combinations of a camera and a 3D lidar. Our method is rated #2 on the KITTI odometry benchmark irrespective of sensing modality, and is rated #1 among visual odometry methods.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an accurate and real-time positioning method for intelligent road vehicles in urban environments. The proposed method uses a robust lane marking detection algorithm, as well as an efficient shape registration algorithm between the detected lane markings and a GPS based road shape prior, to improve the robustness and accuracy of global localization of a road vehicle. We exploit both the state-of-the-art technologies of visual localization based on lane marking detection and the wide availability of Global Positioning System (GPS) based localization. We show that by formulating the positioning problem in a relative sense, we can estimate the vehicle localization in real-time and bound its absolute error in centimeter-level by a cross validation scheme. The validation scheme integrates the vision based lane marking detection with the shape registration, and improves the performance of the overall localization system. The GPS localization can be refined by using lane marking detection when the GPS suffers from frequent satellite signal masking or blockage, while lane marking detection is validated and completing by the GPS based road shape prior when it does not work well in adverse weather conditions or with poor lane signature. We extensively evaluate the proposed method with a single forward-looking camera mounted on an autonomous vehicle which travels at 60km/h through several urban street scenes.",

The key to this high level of performance is a continuously-refined internal 3D representation of all the relevant scene elements. Occlusions are handled implicitly in this approach and a soft-constraint mechanism is used to obtain the highest precision at a specific region-of-interest. The system is well-suited for implementation on Graphics Processing Units and thanks to a tight integration of the latter's graphical and computational capability, scene updates can be obtained at framerates exceeding 40 Hz. We demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of this system on a complex real-world manipulation task involving active endpoint closed-loop visual servo control in the presence of both camera and target object motion.",

This system leads to a novel framework to solve the traditional challenge of surveillance through tracking of multiple persons, such as severe occlusion, similar appearance, illumination changes, and outline deformation. To cover the entire space of indoor surveillance scene, the image stitching based on the cameras' spatial relation is also utilized. The background subtraction of the stitched top-view image can then be performed to extract the foreground objects in the cluttered environment. The detection scheme including the graph-based segmentation, the head hemiellipsoid model, and the geodesic distance map are cascaded to detect humans. Moreover, the shape feature based on diffusion distance is designed to verify the human tracking hypotheses within particle filter. The experimental results demonstrate the real-time performance and robustness in comparison with several state-of-the-art detection and tracking algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Pose estimation of deformable objects is a fundamental and challenging problem in robotics. We present a novel solution to this problem by first reconstructing a 3D model of the object from a low-cost depth sensor such as Kinect, and then searching a database of simulated models in different poses to predict the pose. Given noisy depth images from 360-degree views of the target object acquired from the Kinect sensor, we reconstruct a smooth 3D model of the object using depth image segmentation and volumetric fusion. Then with an efficient feature extraction and matching scheme, we search the database, which contains a large number of deformable objects in different poses, to obtain the most similar model, whose pose is then adopted as the prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate better accuracy and orders of magnitude speed-up compared to our previous work. An additional benefit of our method is that it produces a high-quality mesh model and camera pose, which is necessary for other tasks such as regrasping and object manipulation.",

Humans communicate using body language and gestures in addition to other linguistic modalities like prosody and text or dialog structure. This research aims to develop a pointing gesture detection system for robot to robot communication scenarios to grant robots an ability to convey object identity information without global localization of the agents. The detection is based on RGB-D and a NAO humanoid robot is used as the pointing agent in the experiments. The presented algorithms are based on PCL library. The results indicate that real-time detection of pointing gesture can be performed with little information about the embodiment of the pointing agent and that an observing agent can use the gesture detection to perform actions on the pointed targets.",

Non-rigid SFM methods commonly process a video sequence offline in a batch way. While there are real-time methods for rigid models, reconstruction of deformable 3D shapes for real-time applications is still unsolved. Dense approaches offer promising results, but processing all frames in batch, offline. We propose a real-time non-rigid reconstruction method based on a known deformable model. Object shape and pose is tracked by real-time estimation of camera pose and deformation coefficients. An extensive evaluation of the algorithm on several data sets, and comparison with state-of-the-art techniques is performed.

In order to benefit from fast reactions on the MP-layer, the optimal control layer can be overridden in risky situations to generate quick, though non-optimal solutions. By this, the system fulfills four desirable properties. It continuously adapts the robot's motion without noticeable delay (1) by optimizing for collision and joint limit avoidance based on a future time horizon instead of the current state only (2). It accounts for the full robot motion that may result from multiple active MPs at the same time (3) and despite a possibly slow optimization still provides the robustness and quick reaction capabilities of MPs (4). The framework has been validated in an experiment in which a humanoid robot performed a task, optimized wrt. collisions and joint limit avoidance, but still could react within 50 ms after detection of a potential risk.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a low-complexity, novel approach to wireless sensor network (WSN) assisted autonomous mobile robot (AMR) navigation. The goal is to have an AMR navigate to a target location using only the information inherent to WSNs, i.e., topology of the WSN and received signal strength (RSS) information, while executing an efficient navigation path. Here, the AMR has neither the location information for the WSN, nor any sophisticated ranging equipment for prior mapping. Two schemes are proposed utilizing particle filtering based bearing estimation with RSS values obtained from directional antennas. Real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes. In the basic node-to-node navigation scheme, the bearing-only particle filtering reduces trajectory length by 11.7% (indoors) and 15% (outdoors), when compared to using raw bearing measurements. The advanced scheme further reduces the trajectory length by 22.8% (indoors) and 19.8% (outdoors), as compared to the basic scheme. The mechanisms exploit the low-cost, low-complexity advantages of the WSNs to provide an effective method for map-less and ranging-less navigation.",

This work focuses on the development of nonlinear controllers for compliant serial-chain manipulators. In particular, we derive a novel algorithm that analytically computes feedback linearizing controllers for N-link manipulators with compliant joints. It is possible to express the controllers in closed form because we use geometric notation to concisely derive an algorithm that analytically inverts the manipulator's generalized inertia matrix. The resultant recursive dynamic expressions make it possible to solve for the feedback linearizing controllers exactly. Simulation results which apply the closed-form controllers to the analytic dynamics of a six-joint serial manipulator with series-elastic actuators are provided.",

        "abstract": "Robotic systems can improve percutaneous interventions by steering flexible needles along nonlinear trajectories. These systems require medical image feedback for accurate closed-loop control. Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound can provide real-time measurements of needle pose within tissue; however, the ultrasound produces relatively large amounts of measurement noise. A recursive estimation approach is described for accurately estimating the six-degree-of-freedom pose of a steerable needle tip, by applying an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to 3D ultrasound segmentation results. The UKF is formulated based on a kinematic process model of needle steering, as well as experimental quantification of the statistical variability of steering and imaging needles in biological tissue. Validation testing shows that the UKF method makes accurate closed-loop robotic control of the needle tip possible in biological tissue. Compared to direct use of noisy ultrasound data for control feedback, the UKF reduced average positioning error by 9.58 mm (81%) when steering towards a simulated target. This new estimation scheme will contribute towards the future evaluation of needle steering robots in real-world clinical applications.",

Here it can be advantageous to only sample regions of interest while skipping uninteresting sections of the environment. In this paper, we present a coverage tree structure that can accommodate non-uniform coverage of regions in the target area. Three strategies are proposed to traverse the coverage tree. Experiments indicate that in some situations our method can cover the interesting regions with about half the travel time / cost of a naive regular `lawnmower' coverage pattern.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Dynamic soaring (DS) is an aerobatic maneuver whereby a gliding aircraft harnesses energy from horizontal wind that varies in strength and/or direction to support flight. Typical approaches to dynamic soaring in autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) use nonlinear optimizers to generate energy-gaining trajectories, which are then followed using traditional controllers. The effectiveness of such a strategy is limited by both the local optimality of the generated trajectory, as well as controller tracking errors. In this paper, we investigate a reinforcement learning (RL) approach working in continuous space to control a DS aircraft flying in shear wind conditions. The RL controller operates in two stages: In the first stage, it observes a traditional sample-based controller flying a locally optimal DS trajectory generated a priori. In the second stage, the sample-based controller is removed and authority is passed to the RL algorithm. We show that by deviating from the original planned trajectory, the RL controller is able to achieve better performance than its baseline teacher controller.",

Remote control is one of the effective solutions to navigate the robot to the target location, but the user suffers from the burden to continuously concentrate on the remote control. As the result, several users are required in accordance with the number of robots to operate. In this paper, we propose the remote control system that uses touch panel interface, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and motion planning to achieve autonomy of mobile robots. To navigate the robot in the proposed system, the user only designates the destination and via-points by touching on the map estimated by the SLAM. After receiving the user's input, the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) generates the feasible path to the destination using the estimated map. The effectiveness of the proposed system is verified through experiments where multiple mobile robots are remotely controlled.",

For precise control, the tether effects have been analyzed through a partial differential equation. Each element of the tether has been taken as an elastic body, and the tether has been divided into two parts: in the air and in the sea water, waves and current disturbances have been taken into consideration. Based on the dynamic model of ROV, a backstepping sliding mode controller has been established in order to improve the controller's systematic robustness against disturbances. Theoretical analysis proves that the solutions are ultimately bounded using the proposed controller. Tank experiments with and without current disturbances have been performed including the depth control, heading control and pipeline tracking. The efficacy and superiority of the backstepping sliding mode control have been verified. It is confirmed the analysis and the controller can meet the request for target tracking control.",

        "abstract": "Remote robotic explorations for collapsed buildings in a severe disaster are demanded. However, rescue robots cannot approach the rubble due to safety risks. This study proposes a remote vertical exploration system for collapsed buildings with a robotic inspection system hoisted by a crane. An Active Scope Camera (ASC) has many advantages for the vertical exploration such as a light and flexible continuum body to produce distributed driving forces. The purpose of this paper is to confirm the feasibility of the vertical exploration system with the ASC. The vertical explorations have proper problems related to contact and hanging conditions of the scope cable. We developed a new ASC that has a two-step bending mechanism to produce larger head movement in multi-DOF. We also evaluated the performances of the prototype when the contact areas were small. Finally, we conducted a remote vertical exploration experiments at the simulated collapsed building in 6 m height. The robot could explore in six different pathways by changing head directions and running the rubbles within seven trials. The experimental results showed that the proposed system has high potential to get inserted in the deep area in the rubble.",

        "abstract": "Recently, ridesharing mobile applications, which dynamically match passengers to drivers, have begun to gain popularity. These services have the potential to fill empty seats in cars, reduce emissions and enable more efficient transportation. Ridesharing services become even more practical as robotic cars become available to do all the driving. In this work, we propose rideshare services which transfer passengers between multiple drivers. By planning for transfers, we can increase the availability and range of the rideshare service, and also reduce the total vehicular miles travelled by the network. We propose three heuristic algorithms to schedule rideshare routes with transfers. Each gives a tradeoff in terms of effectiveness and computational cost. We demonstrate these tradeoffs, both in simulation and on data from taxi passengers in San Francisco. We demonstrate scenarios where transferring passengers can provide a significant advantage.",

In this paper, we consider the problem of online trajectory generation for safe navigation in the presence of state uncertainty and the resulting deviations from the desired trajectory. Our approach combines probabilistic estimation of the a priori collision risk with efficient trajectory generation, exploiting the differential flatness of many robotic systems in an explicitly constrained polynomial trajectory representation. Through trajectory optimization, our approach allows to flexibly trade off risk against, for example, the duration of the trajectory. It is computationally efficient because each optimization step has polynomial complexity. In contrast to other approaches, our method can also optimize the trajectory duration and supports cost functions that facilitate higher-order smoothness of the trajectory. Our experiments demonstrate the performance of the approach and show that our trajectories result in substantially lower collisions probabilities compared to minimum-snap trajectories in a quadrotor landing task.",

RTC was created by NASA-JSC in conjunction with General Motors for use with the Robonaut-2 and Valkyrie humanoid robot platforms. RTC provides a robot programming syntax and an IDE appropriate for use by experts and non-experts for implementation and execution. An expert developer can implement a new application with a combination of scripts, called process nodes, and state machines that set the control mode of the robot. A non-expert developer can assemble process nodes and controller state machines into novel hierarchical applications using a visual programming language (VPL). This VPL also allows developers to interface with other RTC applications or with third-party software packages using a variety of network transport mechanisms (ROS, TCP, shared memory, etc.). RTC represents an advantage over other robot programming frameworks by providing multiple levels of flexibility for development. The efficacy of RTC is demonstrated through examples of sophisticated behaviors, such as programming the Valkyrie robot to grab objects and turn a valve.",

        "abstract": "Chinese calligraphy is a unique form of art in the world, whose aesthetic is mainly created by the proper manipulation of the brush. However, it is impossible for a person to figure out the 6-D motion of the brush from calligraphy images, if he has no experience of writing calligraphy. In this paper, we propose a Learning from Demonstration approach for our calligraphy robot, Callibot, to acquire calligraphy skills. We first propose a new stroke parametrization approach. Then we apply Locally Weighted Linear Regression to map from the stroke parameters to the trajectory of the brush. The training data are obtained from several demonstrations. Thereafter, Callibot is capable of writing a new stroke, if the stroke's parameters are given. The resulting motion is as natural as human writing. Experimental results prove the feasibility of our proposed approach. This approach is independent of the robot and is compatible with any robot with six or more degrees of freedom. This approach can be further integrated with our previous research, i.e. stroke extraction, so that Callibot will be able to replicate calligraphy from images.",

Motivated by high density of smartphones in public spaces, we propose to use a robot-assisted localization system in which the low-cost Kinect sensor and smartphone-based acoustic relative ranging are used to localize moving human targets in indoor environments. An extended Kalman filter based localization algorithm is developed for real-time dynamic position estimation. We present both simulations and real robot-smartphone experiments demonstrating the performance with a localization accuracy of approximately 0.5m.",

Multi-contact manipulation is useful for object-environment interaction tasks because it can provide both powerful grasping of the object body and dexterous manipulation of the object end-effector. However, dealing with the internal link contact with the object is not trivial. In this paper, we propose Reactional Internal Contact Hypothesis that regards the internal contact force as a reaction force so that the desired finger force can be reduced. By taking a handwriting task as an example, optimal configuration search and grasping force computation problems are addressed based on this hypothesis and validated via dynamic simulation.",

Because of this uncertainty, earlier work has concentrated on finding the \u201cbest\u201d object composition and based on this composition decided on manipulation actions. Contrary to earlier work, we 1) utilize different possible object compositions in decision making, 2) take advantage of object composition information provided by robot actions, 3) take into account the effect of different competing object hypothesis on the actual task to be performed. We cast the manipulation planning problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) which plans over possible hypotheses of object compositions. The POMDP model chooses the action that maximizes the long-term expected task specific utility, and while doing so, considers the value of informative actions and the effect of different object hypotheses on the completion of the task. In experiments with a physical robot arm and an RGB-D sensor, our approach outperforms an approach that only considers the most likely object composition.",

Robotic nonprehensile catching can be achieved by caging or partial caging with gravity. Since an object is restricted within a bounded region via nonprehensile catching, accurate finger positioning is not required because the robotic hand should be moved to an appropriate region where caging is achieved. Second, control strategies for nonprehensile catching are proposed. The robotic arm motion is generated on-line by using visual sensory feedback in response to the object motion. Noting that the object passes from the outside to the inside of the workspace of the robotic arm, the motion phases of which are divided into tracking and catching based on the specified region in a 3-D space. Finally, the validity of the resulting methods is demonstrated by experiments.",

In this paper, a Robust Fixed Point Transformations (RFPT)-based Model Reference Adaptive Controller (MRAC) is designed for a modified Translational Oscillations by a Rotational Actuator (TORA) system, which is an indirectly driven, underactuated classical mechanical system with peculiar properties. The RFPT-based design has the advantage of working only with three free parameters, and does not need complex a priori calculations. It is founded on the idea that at the cost of replacing the requirement for global stability with local stability, a mathematically very simple and geometrically lucid, well interpreted methodology can be developed. The resulting structure directly concentrates on the primary design intent, i.e., on the realization of a purely kinematically prescribed trajectory tracking. Examples and simulation results are presented in this paper, demonstrating that the RFPT-based design can provide an efficient MRAC controller for a very special physical system.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a practical robust attitude controller for uncertain hexarotor micro aerial vehicles (MAVs). The proposed robust controller consists of a nominal linear time-invariant controller and a robust compensator for pitch, roll, and yaw subsystems. The nominal controller is an inner-outer loop structure of PI+PID (proportional-integral plus proportional-integral-derivative) control method to achieve the desired tracking of the nominal system, whilst the robust compensator is added to restrain the influence of the uncertainties (equivalent disturbances) which contain parametric uncertainties, coupling, nonlinear dynamics, and external disturbances. The real-time experimental results on the hexarotor demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller in real flight condition and finally, the attitude tracking errors are proven to be ultimately bounded with specified boundaries.",

In this paper, the DOB is applied only on the motor-side dynamics of the robot, and the uncertainties on the motor-side are successfully eliminated. It is shown that, to guarantee the stability, the estimated motor-side position should be fed back into the controller, which is different from usual setup of the DOB. The experiments/simulations show that the estimated signal feedback indeed guarantees the stability, whereas the measured signal feedback does not.",

In this paper, we propose a robust and accurate forceps tracking method to estimate the full state of the forceps (i.e., the position, posture, and grip parameters) using visual information obtained from stereo microscopic images and kinematic information obtained from the robotic sensory information, forward kinematics, and hand-eye coordination. An online method for updating the hand-eye coordination was also developed using an extended Kalman filter to cancel the hand-eye coordination errors caused by the repositioning of the microscope. The experimental results showed that the proposed method could accurately and robustly estimate the state of the robotic forceps even after the repositioning of the microscope.",

We also look into how these methods achieve the desired robustness and what are the implications for the SLAM problem. We discuss the issues involved in using the output of these robust back-ends for tasks such as path planning and how they can be addressed. The problem of robustness needs to be addressed adequately in order to have a complete and reliable solution to the SLAM problem.",

The method simultaneously estimates a camera ego-motion and vertex heights of a regular mesh, which is composed of piecewise triangular patches drawn on a level plane in the ground coordinate system, by minimizing pixel value differences over the ground surface. The method combinationally uses feature-based approach and pixel-based approach for robustly estimating ego-motion parameters. We also show that this combination is beneficial for removing outlier pixels, which mainly represent the edge of the self-shadow area on the ground surface. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments using real images.",

No information regarding the robot dynamic model is employed in the design procedure. Moreover, the tracking performance of the developed scheme (i.e., convergence rate and steady state error) is a priori and explicitly imposed by a designer-specified performance function, and is fully decoupled by both the control gains selection and the robot dynamic model. In that respect, the selection of the control gains is only confined to adopting those values that lead to reasonable control effort. Finally, two experimental studies in the joint and the Cartesian workspace clarify the design procedure and verify its performance and robustness against external disturbances.",

However, the practicality of such methods highly depends on their robustness to system uncertainties and ability to handle the constraints of the system. Many of the previous works proposed effective remedies for constraint handling; yet, only a few of them considered the system uncertainties. This work proposes a novel control scheme for visual servoing which basically exploits a model predictive controller to handle the constraints. In addition to that, the uncertainty model of the system is developed to handle the constraints more efficiently. The simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control method for constraint handling, in the presence of system uncertainties.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports a control strategy of a micro-gripper based on two AFM tips for manipulation at micro/nano scale. It is composed of dual micro/nano manipulators in order to handle and to maintain a microsample through the focus of a X-ray or laser beam for material characterization and analysis. The main idea is to control and to drive in a robust way the micro/nanomanipulators by focusing the beam on the center part of the handled micro-object. To this aim, the maximum intensity of the laser beam is measured in real-time by a four-quadrant photodiode sensor. As the sample under consideration here is a superparamagnetic microsphere of 8.2 \u03bcm (focusing laser spot less than few \u03bcm2), the laser tracking system is very sensitive to light intensity variations, mechanical vibrations, microhandling force perturbations and thermal relaxation of magnetic microsamples. First, we propose to compensate the laser beam variations by estimating the position of the laser beam using a particle filter (PF) algorithm. Then, a robust control strategy based on H\u221e controllers ensures a robust microhandling task under the focus of the laser beam whatever the external perturbations involved and parametric model uncertainties. The dual manipulators are controlled cooperatively by combining the different actuator dynamics to track a laser beam with nanometer precision. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the microhandling task using the proposed robust control scheme.",

        "abstract": "Providing reliable end-to-end communication for teams of robots requires the integration of novel routing techniques, motion planning algorithms, and transport level communication protocols. In this paper we look at existing robust routing solutions that provide redundancy at the routing layer and develop the Multi-Confirmation Transmission Protocol (MCTP) to take advantage of that redundancy at the transport level. The resulting system that integrates robust routing and MCTP is evaluated in experiments performed in complex environments. The integrated system is observed to provide a robust architecture that allows for near lossless communication while operating in a complex environment with less traffic than standard confirmation protocols.",

        "abstract": "A robust numerical solution of the prioritized inverse kinematics is proposed. It is based on the augmented Lagrangian function and Hestenes-Powell's multiplier method. It originates the weighted inverse kinematics and only requires a small modification including an accumulation of the error of the high-priority constraint at each step of iteration and an estimation of Lagrange's multiplier. Hence, it is preferable to the conventional method, which is accompanied with an explicit complex computation of the kernel space, from the viewpoint of both the implementation cost and the computation cost per step. A drawback is that the proposed method becomes slow in some situations since Lagrange's multiplier linearly converges, while the joint displacements superlinearly converge. In some unlucky situations, it requires more computation cost in total than the conventional method. However, the proposed method is robust even in cases where the high-priority constraint is unsatisfiable. In fact, the proposed method solely succeeded in all the tested cases including unsolvable ones.",

        "abstract": "Jumping locomotion has been widely employed in milliscale mobile robots to help overcome their size limitations by extending their range and enabling them to overcome obstacles. During jumping, the robot's legs experience acceleration that is up to an order of magnitude greater than the gravitational acceleration. This large force results in bending of the jumping legs. In this paper, we study how the bending of the leg affects the jumping performance of a flea-inspired jumping robot. To judge the effect of the leg compliance, the amount of energy lost during jumping is determined by examining the ratio of kinetic energy to input energy, which we define as the mechanical efficiency. The bending leg is dynamically modeled using a pseudo-rigid-body model in order to precisely analyze the energy transfer. Jumping experiments are performed for five different legs, each with a different stiffness. Shape memory polymer rivets, which are lightweight and compact, were used to easily switch out the legs. The mechanical efficiency of the robot with appropriately chosen leg compliance was 41.27% compared with 36.93% for the rigid case and 21.51% for the much more compliant case. The results show that optimizing the compliance of a jumping leg can improve the performance of a jumping robot.",

We show that although simulation can be used to predict real robot behaviour, drift between simulation and reality occurs over time due to the reality gap. This necessitates periodic reinitialisation of the simulation to reduce false positives. Using a simple obstacle avoidance controller afflicted with partial motor failure, we show that selecting the length of this reinitialisation time period is non-trivial, and that there exists a trade-off between minimising drift and the ability to detect the presence of faults.",

        "abstract": "Legged robots enjoy kilohertz control rates but are still making incremental gains towards becoming as nimble as animals. In contrast, bipedal animals are amazingly robust runners despite lagged state feedback from protracted neuromechanical delays. Based on evidence from biological experiments, we posit that much of disturbance rejection can be offloaded from feedback control and encoded into feed-forward pre-reflexive behaviors called preflexes. We present a framework for the offline numerical generation of preflex behaviors to optimally stabilize legged locomotion tasks in the presence of response delays. By coupling directly collocated trajectory optimizations, we optimize the preflexive motion of a simple bipedal running model to recover from uncertain terrain geometry using minimal actuator work. In simulation, the optimized preflex maneuver showed 30-77% economy improvements over a level-ground strategy when responding to terrain deviating just 2-4cm from the nominal condition. We claim this \u201cpreflex-and-replan\u201d framework for designing efficient and robust gaits is amenable to a variety of robots and extensible to arbitrary locomotion tasks.",

SLAM approaches that make use of objects and higher level features have also recently been proposed. Using higher level features provides several benefits: these can be more discriminative, which helps data association, and can serve to inform service robotic tasks that require higher level information, such as object models and poses. We propose an approach for online object discovery and object modeling, and extend a SLAM system to utilize these discovered and modeled objects as landmarks to help localize the robot in an online manner. Such landmarks are particularly useful for detecting loop closures in larger maps. In addition to the map, our system outputs a database of detected object models for use in future SLAM or service robotic tasks. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the approach's ability to detect and model objects, as well as to improve SLAM results by detecting loop closures.",

        "abstract": "Swing leg adjustment, repulsive leg function and balance are key elements in the control of bipedal locomotion. In simple gait models like spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP), swing leg control can be applied to achieve stable running. The aim of this study is to investigate the ability of pendulum like swing leg motion for stabilizing running and reproducing a desired (human like) gait pattern. The employed running model consists of two sub-models: SLIP model for the stance phase and a pendulum based control for the swing phase. It is shown that with changing the pendulum length at each step, stable running gaits with widely different performances are achieved. The body vertical speed at take off is utilized as feedback information to tune the pendulum length as the control parameter. In particular, the effect of the pendulum length adjustment on the motion characteristics like horizontal speed, apex height and the stabilized system energy will be investigated. With this method key features of the human like swing leg motion e.g. leg retraction can be reproduced. Higher speeds correspond larger angular motion of each leg which is in agreement with experimental results in previous studies. The presented model also explains the swing-leg to stance-leg interaction mechanism which was not addressed in the underlying SLIP model. This conceptual model can be considered as a functional mechanical template for legged locomotion and can be used to build more complex models, e.g. having segmented legs or an upper body.",

While most previous work concentrated on finding a solution that completes the coverage as quickly as possible, in this paper we consider a new version of the problem: adversarial coverage. Here, the robot operates in an environment that contains threats that might stop the robot. We introduce the problem of finding the safest adversarial coverage path, and present different optimization criteria for the evaluation of these paths. We show that finding an optimal solution to the safest coverage problem is NP-Complete. We therefore suggest two heuristic algorithms: STAC, a spanning-tree based coverage algorithm, and GSAC, which follows a greedy approach. These algorithms produce close to optimal solutions in polynomial time. We establish theoretical bounds on the total risk involved in the coverage paths created by these algorithms and on their lengths. Lastly, we compare the effectiveness of these two algorithms in various types of environments and settings.",

They can be used to generate constraint satisfying samples for problems including complicated linkage robots (e.g. closed chains and graspers). They can also be used to assist robot operators and to help in robot design.We show that reachable volumes have an O(1) complexity in unconstrained problems as well as in many constrained problems. We also show that reachable volumes can be computed in linear time and that reachable volume samples can be generated in linear time in problems without constraints. We experimentally validate reachable volume sampling, both with and without constraints on end effectors and/or internal joints. We show that reachable volume samples are less likely to be invalid due to self-collisions, making reachable volume sampling significantly more efficient for higher dimensional problems. We also show that these samples are easier to connect than others, resulting in better connected roadmaps. We demonstrate that our method can be applied to 262-dof, multi-loop, and tree-like linkages including combinations of planar, prismatic and spherical joints. In contrast, existing methods either cannot be used for these problems or do not produce good quality solutions.",

Inspired by the discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator the underlying distance metric is based upon the difference from a reference trajectory through a quadratic distance term incorporating velocity and acceleration deviations along the trajectory. Mathematically-backed approximations in combination with a task-space bias make it possible to use standard nearest neighbor methods in task space when expanding the RRT*-tree. It is shown that metric-consistent biases considerably increase the convergence speed. The proposed approach is validated in simulations in a 2D environment and in experiments using a HRP-4 humanoid robot.",

The planner is geared toward high-dimensional mobile robots with nonlinear dynamics operating in complex environments. The planner incorporates physics-based engines for accurate simulations of rigid-body dynamics. To obtain computational efficiency and generate low-cost solutions, the planner first imposes a discrete abstraction by combining an automaton representing the LTL formula with a workspace decomposition. The planner then uses the discrete abstraction to induce a partition of a sampling-based motion tree being expanded in the state space into equivalence classes. Each equivalence class captures the progress made toward achieving the temporal logic specifications. Heuristics defined over the abstraction are used to estimate the feasibility of expanding the motion tree from these equivalence classes and reaching an accepting automaton state. Costs are adjusted based on progress made, giving the planner the flexibility to make rapid progress while discovering new ways to expand the search. Comparisons to related work show statistically significant computational speedups and reduced solution costs.",

        "abstract": "Pose graph optimization is an elegant and efficient formulation for robot localization and mapping. Experimental evidence suggests that, in real problems, the set of measurements used to estimate robot poses is prone to contain outliers, due to perceptual aliasing and incorrect data association. While several related works deal with the rejection of outliers during pose estimation, the goal of this paper is to propose a grounded strategy for measurements selection, i.e., the output of our approach is a set of \u201creliable\u201d measurements, rather than pose estimates. Because the classification in inliers/outliers is not observable in general, we pose the problem as finding the maximal subset of the measurements that is internally coherent. In the linear case, we show that the selection of the maximal coherent set can be (conservatively) relaxed to obtain a linear programming problem with \u21131 objective. We show that this approach can be extended to (nonlinear) planar pose graph optimization using similar ideas as our previous work on linear approaches to pose graph optimization. We evaluate our method on standard datasets, and we show that it is robust to a large number of outliers and different outlier generation models, while entailing the advantages of linear programming (fast computation, scalability).",

The sensor encapsulated in the liposome contains photochromic chemical, 1, 3, 3-Trimethylindolino-6'- nitrobenzopyrylospiran, for optical control of zeta potential. The molecular structure of spiropyran changes between spiropyran type and merocyanine type by UV/VIS illumination. Zeta potential of merocyanine type is higher than that of spiropyran type. The charge of the liposomes are normally negative. Zeta potential of the liposome is switched from negative to positive by photoisomerization of spiropyran. Positive-charged liposome manipulated by optical tweezers adheres to the cell membrane by electrostatic force since the charge of the cell membrane is negative. The local vibration stimulus using optical tweezers is applied to the cell membrane for rapid injection of the sensor by membrane fusion and endocytosis. We demonstrated selective adhesion of the liposome to the cell membrane by optical control of zeta potential (adhesion rate: 71 %). Moreover, we also demonstrated rapid injection of 1 \u00b5m\u03c6 fluorescence sensor (approximately 30 minutes, injection rate: 100 %) into a cell using local vibration stimulus by optical tweezers.",

        "abstract": "Intelligent robots require a semantic map of the surroundings for applications such as navigation and object localization. With this information, a robot can make task planning, object manipulation and human-robot interaction. However, it still remains an open problem although considerable emphasis has been given. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to generate a dense semantic map for 3D indoor scene. Our approach integrates a robust image labeling algorithm with simultaneous localization and mapping method (SLAM) to generate the semantic map. Scene information, semantic context and geometric context are encoded into a CRF model. Our CRF model computes a simultaneous labeling of image regions into semantic classes (e.g., bed, table, chair) and structural object classes (Ground, Furniture, Structure, Props). Then semantic labeling results in single images are fused into the 3D map using the estimated camera poses by SLAM. We report our labeling performance on NYU v2 dataset and demonstrate that our algorithm is comparable to and in many cases superior to the previous method. Also we generate our semantic map on the NYU v2 video dataset.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper explores a new hybrid actuation principle combining pneumatic and tendon-driven actuators for a soft robotic manipulator. The fusion of these two actuation principles leads to an overall antagonistic actuation mechanism whereby pneumatic actuation opposes tendon actuation - a mechanism commonly found in animals where muscles can oppose each other to vary joint stiffness. We are taking especially inspiration from the octopus who belongs to the class of Cephalopoda; the octopus uses its longitudinal and transversal muscles in its arms to achieve varied motion patterns; activating both sets of muscles, the octopus can control the arm stiffness over a wide range. Our approach mimics this behavior and achieves comparable motion patterns, including bending, elongation and stiffening. The proposed method combines the advantages of tendon-driven and pneumatic actuated systems and goes beyond what current soft, flexible robots can achieve: because the new robot structure is effectively an inflatable, sleeve, it can be pumped up to its fully inflated volume and, also, completely deflated and shrunk. Since, in the deflated state, it comprises just its outer \u201cskin\u201d and tendons, the robot can be compressed to a very small size, many times smaller when compared to its fully-inflated state. In this paper, we describe the mechanical structure of the soft manipulator. Proof-of-concept experiments focus on the robot's ability to bend, to morph from completely shrunk to entirely inflated as well as to vary its stiffness.",

Since the proposed controller does not require detailed referential motion trajectories, it enables a robot to walk sideways at arbitrary velocity given at random timing.

Techniques to automatically update the referential position of the center of mass and phase for the consistent footstep are also proposed.",

In addition, the simulator implements military-grade models for wind and turbulence, as well as noise models for satellite navigation, barometric altitude and orientation. The usefulness of the simulator is shown qualitatively by a comparing how coloured and white position noise affect the performance of offline, range-only SLAM. The simulator is intended to be used for planning experiments, or for stress-testing application performance over a wide range of operating conditions.",

The system is suitable for obtaining inner cross sectional images of the aorta with an IVUS probe, reconstructing its 3D virtual model using sensor fusion of the corresponding pose information of IVUS probe from an electromagnetic (EM) sensor, as well as reconstructing the catheter shape based on optical fibers with Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors. A hybrid probe consisting of an IVUS sensor, an EM sensor and an optical shape sensor has been created and tested on in-vitro silicone aortic phantoms. A practical image processing method based on the gradient vector flow (GVF) snake has been proposed, followed by fusion with pose information from an EM sensor for the anatomical model reconstruction. Demonstration of the proposed method was performed on two aortic phantoms. Preliminary results show how the catheter shape reconstruction is realized by the shape sensor. The proposed method could facilitate intra-operative surgical guidance for valve alignment, improve the precision for positioning, reduce the time of the TAVI procedure, minimize the use of contrast agent, and assess the status of the deployed valve after surgery.",

The highest ranked hypothesis at any moment becomes the active representation that is used to guide the robot to its goal location. A single static representation is insufficient for navigation in dynamic environments where paths can be blocked periodically, a common scenario which poses significant challenges for typical planners. In our approach we simultaneously rank multiple map hypotheses by the influence that localization in each of them has on locally accurate odometry. This is done online for the current locally accurate window by formulating a factor graph of odometry relaxed by localization constraints. Comparison of the resulting perturbed odometry of each hypothesis with the original odometry yields a score that can be used to rank map hypotheses by their utility. We deploy the proposed approach on a real robot navigating a structurally noisy office environment. The configuration of the environment is physically altered outside the robots sensory horizon during navigation tasks to demonstrate the proposed approach of hypothesis selection.",

For instance, most door-handles require the same basic skill (reach, grasp, turn, pull), but small adaptations of the basic skill are required to adapt to the variations that exist (e.g. levers vs. knobs). We introduce the algorithm \u201cSimultaneous On-line Discovery and Improvement of Robotic Skills\u201d (SODIRS) that is able to autonomously discover and optimize skill options for such task variations. We formalize the problem in a reinforcement learning context, and use the PIBB algorithm [2] to continually optimize skills with respect to a cost function. SODIRS discovers new subskills, or \u201cskill options\u201d, by clustering the costs of trials, and determining whether perceptual features are able to predict which cluster a trial will belong to. This enables SODIRS to build a decision tree, in which the leaves contain skill options for task variations. We demonstrate SODIRS' performance in simulation, as well as on a Meka humanoid robot performing the ball-in-cup task.",

        "abstract": "Actuators that are powered, imaged, and controlled by Magnetic Resonance (MR) scanners offer the potential of inexpensively providing wireless control of MR-guided robots. Similar to traditional electric motors, the MR scanner acts as the stator and generates propulsive torques on an actuator rotor containing one or more ferrous particles. The MR scanner can control three orthogonal gradient fields. Prior work demonstrated control of a single actuator rotor. This paper proposes and demonstrates independent, simultaneous control of n rotors. The controller relies on inhomogeneity between rotors, such as ensuring no rotor axes are parallel. This paper provides easily-implemented velocity and position controllers with global asymptotic convergence, and optimization techniques for implementation. Code for simulations and control laws is available online.",

        "abstract": "We present a joint demonstration between the Robotics, Autonomous Systems, and Controls Laboratory (RASCAL) at UC Davis and the Columbia University Robotics Group, wherein a human-in-the-loop robotic grasping platform in the Columbia lab (New York, NY) is controlled to select and grasp an object by a C3\u2013C4 spinal cord injury (SCI) subject in the UC Davis lab (Davis, CA) using a new single-signal, multi-degree-of-freedom surface electromyography (sEMG) human-robot interface. The grasping system breaks the grasping task into a multi-stage pipeline that can be navigated with only a few inputs. It integrates pre-planned grasps with on-line grasp planning capability and an object recognition and target selection system capable of handling multi-object scenes with moderate occlusion. Previous work performed in the RASCAL lab demonstrated that by continuously modulating the power in two individual bands in the frequency spectrum of a single sEMG signal, users were able to control a cursor in 2D for cursor to target tasks. Using this paradigm, four targets were presented in order for the subject to command the multi-stage grasping pipeline. We demonstrate that using this system, operators are able to grasp objects in a remote location using a robotic grasping platform.",

A path following algorithm that uses visual odometry, robot body kinematics, and a variety of specialized gaits was used to demonstrate micro-gravity mobility with as few as 12 actuators. A mapping algorithm is also demonstrated that will enable path planning, limb trajectory planning, mobile grasping, and foot placement in future work.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel method to measure the contraction length and force output of Pneumatic Artificial Muscles. Our key innovation is to make the braid of these fiber-reinforced actuators out of insulated wires that form a single electric circuit. Changes in the inductance and resistance of this circuit can be related to muscle contraction length and muscle force. We implemented the proposed approach in two McKibben muscles that were evaluated under a variety of air pressures (0-200 kPa) and loads (0-45 N). The experiments confirmed our theoretical prediction of a roughly linear relationship between the measured inductance and the contraction length, as well as a strong correlation between the measured resistance and the actuator force. We were able to determine force with a resolution of 5N and contraction length with a resolution of 0.5 mm. This technique can be used to create flexible, precise, and robust self-sensing actuators that benefit a multitude of robotic applications.",

The mechanics of this motion on flat ground and steady state terrains have been thoroughly investigated, while its capability to adapt to changing environments is not as well studied. We demonstrate the capability of a snake robot to automatically adjust gait parameters to optimally move up and down slopes of varying angle. This capability is achieved by three components. First, an efficient offline learning algorithm finds a policy mapping the estimated slope angle to the optimal gait parameters. Next, a robust online state estimation technique infers the local terrain characteristics. Finally, the precomputed policy is consulted online to select the optimal gait parameters for this slope. The efficacy of this approach is verified by robot experiments.",

One of the main issues for the transportation is how to decelerate the capsule during its flight to avoid a large landing impact. In order to stop the capsule temporally in the air just before its landing, we propose a flight control method by multidirectional tension of wires. Since the capsule is connected with both auxiliary weights and reel system via wires, it can be geometrically constrained not to move by multiple pull of the wires. We develop the motion planner which makes the capsule reach the target at the desired speed, and control algorithm for it. The proposed method is applied to the soft landing of the capsule. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through the experiment.",

        "abstract": "Tracking an underwater chain using an autonomous vehicle can be a first step towards more efficient solutions for cleaning and inspecting mooring chains. We propose to use a forward looking sonar as a primary perception sensor to enable the vehicle operation in limited visibility conditions and overcome the turbidity arisen during marine growth removal. Despite its advantages, working with acoustic imagery raises additional challenges to the involved image processing and control methodologies. In this paper we present a robust framework to perform chain following, combining perception, planning and control disciplines. We first introduce a detection system that exploits the sonar's high frame rate and applies local pattern matching to handle the complexity of detecting link chains in acoustic images. Then, a planning system deals with the dispersed detections and determines the link waypoints that the vehicle should reach. Finally, the vehicle is guided through these waypoints using a high level controller that has been tailored to simultaneously traverse the chain and keep track of upcoming links. Experiments on real data demonstrate the capability of autonomously follow a chain with sufficient accuracy to perform subsequent cleaning or inspection tasks.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a novel approach to spatio-temporal calibration of a laser range finder (LRF) with respect to a combination of a stereo camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Spatial calibration between an LRF and a camera has been extensively studied, but so far the temporal relationship between the two has largely been neglected. While this may be sufficient for applications where the setup is mounted on a vehicle, which imposes bounds on the dynamics, we aim for employment on a hand-held scanning device, where angular velocities can easily exceed hundreds of degrees per second. Employing a continuous-time batch estimation framework, this work demonstrates that the transformation between the LRF and the visual/inertial setup-but also its temporal relationship-can be estimated accurately. In contrast to the majority of established calibration approaches, our approach does not require an overlap in the field of view of the LRF and camera, allowing for previously infeasible sensor configurations to be calibrated. Preliminary results for a novel hand-held scanning device suggest improvements in 3D reconstructions and image based point cloud coloring, especially for highly dynamic motions.",

The proposed spatio-temporal motion features are similar to optical flow but are extended on a moving platform with fusion of odometry and show much better classification accuracy with consideration of different uncertainties. In the proposal, the ego motion is compensated by odometry sensors and the laser scan points are accumulated and represented as space-time point clouds, from which the velocities and moving directions can be extracted. Based on these spatio-temporal features, a supervised learning technique is applied to classify the points as static or moving and Kalman filters are implemented to track the moving objects. A real experiment is performed during day and night on an autonomous vehicle platform and shows promising results in a crowded and dynamic environment.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Acoustic reflection inside an enclosed environment is detrimental to human-robot interaction. Reflection may manifest as phantom sources emanating from unknown directions. In effect, a single speaker may falsely manifest as multiple speakers to the robot audition system, impeding the robot's ability to correctly associate the speech command to the actual speaker. Moreover, speech reflection smears the original speech signal due to reverberation. This degrades speech recognition and understanding performance. Conventional robot audition schemes that rely purely on acoustics and spatial information are very sensitive to acoustic reflection which ultimately leads to the failure in human-robot interaction. We propose a method for human-robot interaction robust to the effect of acoustic reflection. First, visual information is utilized and head tracking scheme is employed to reinforce the acoustic information with the visual presence of a prospect user. Second, we employ a model-based sound event identification scheme and scrutinize whether the acoustic information is likely to be speech or non-speech. Using all the information we have gathered, we create a simple rule construct to effectively discriminate the original source (actual speaker) from phantom sources (reflection). Consequently, the corresponding source identified as phantom (reflection) is used to estimate the unwanted smearing for effective suppression via speech enhancement. Experiments are conducted in human-robot interaction setting in which the proposed method outperforms the conventional method.",

The proposed method makes use of multithreading to parallelize a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter approach. By applying the method in common computers found in robots, it is shown that a significant gain in efficiency can be obtained. Furthermore, the parallel method enables us to raise the number of particles up to values that would not be possible in a single threaded solution, thus gaining in localization precision and map accuracy. In order to analyze SLAM results, frequently used datasets by the robotics community were used, and a benchmarking metric was applied.",

We derive this approach by blending subsequent spherical linear interpolation phases, computing interpolation parameters so that rotational velocity is continuous. We show this method first on simulated manipulator and then perform a physical screwing task on a Schunk LWA4 robot arm. Finally, we provide permissively licensed software which implements this trajectory generation and tracking.",

Synchronization inside each team, intra-group, and between the two teams, inter-group, are important in applications where robots belonging to different teams need to coordinate to perform a given task. We are motivated by the work reported in [1] in which a group of planar agents is driven into a special case of phase balancing known as splay state, i.e., a circular formation with equally spaced phases among the robots in the team. In this paper, we are interested in achieving not only splay state but also phase alignment between the agents in the two groups. We formally analyze the stability of the desired intra-group and inter-group phase configuration state. Simulation and experimental results employing a team of terrestrial robots and a team of rotorcraft aerial platforms verify the validity of the proposed coordination strategy.",

The presented approach extends that detailed in prior work on a point-foot quadruped platform by adding the rotational constraints imposed by the humanoid's flat feet. As in previous work, the proposed Extended Kalman Filter accommodates contact switching and makes no assumptions about gait or terrain, making it applicable on any humanoid platform for use in any task. A nonlinear observability analysis is performed on both the point-foot and flat-foot filters and it is concluded that the addition of rotational constraints significantly simplifies singular cases and improves the observability characteristics of the system. Results on a simulated walking dataset demonstrate the performance gain of the flat-foot filter as well as confirm the results of the presented observability analysis.",

        "abstract": "State lattice-based planning has been used in navigation for ground, water, aerial and space robots. State lattices are typically constructed of simple motion primitives connecting one state to another. There are situations where these metric motions may not be available, such as in GPS-denied areas. In many of these cases, however, the robot may have some additional sensing capability that is not being fully utilized by the planner. For example, if the robot has a camera it may be able to use simple visual servoing techniques to navigate through a GPS-denied region. Likewise, a LIDAR may allow the robot to skirt along an environmental feature even if there is not enough information to generate an accurate pose estimate. In this paper we present an expansion of the state lattice framework that allows us to incorporate controller-based motion primitives and external perceptual triggers directly into the planning process. We provide a formal description of our method of constructing the search graph in these cases as well as presenting real-world and simulated testing data showing the practical application of this approach.",

To detect the drilling state of a Robotic Orthopedic Surgery System (ROSS) in real-time, a state recognition method based on audio signals, the Acoustic Emission (AE) signals generated in drilling process, is proposed in this paper. By an analysis via power spectral density of the AE signals, an appropriate frequency band is selected for state recognition. The Exponential Mean Amplitude (EMA) and the Hurst Exponent (HE) are used to illustrate the energy characteristics and stability of the AE signals in the chosen frequency band, respectively. The recognition algorithm combines the two different features is performed on a embedded device in the experiments. Finally, the experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed drilling state recognition method.",

        "abstract": "The estimation of robot's motion at the prediction step of any localization framework is commonly performed using a motion model in conjunction with inertial measurements. In the context of field robotics, articulated mobile robots have complex chassis. They might require a complete model in comparison with the traditionally used planar assumption. In this paper, we use a Jacobian motion model-based approach for real-time inertial-aided odometry. The work makes use of the transformation approach [1] to accurately model 6-DoF kinematics. The algorithm relates normal forces with the probability of a contact-point to slip. The result increases the accuracy by weighting the least-squares solution using static forces prediction. The method is applied to the Asguard v3 system, a simple but highly capable leg-wheel hybrid robot. The performance of the approach is demonstrated in extensive field testing within different unstructured environments. In-depth error analysis and comparison with planar odometry is discussed, resulting in a more accurate localization.",

        "abstract": "Needle insertion in soft-tissue is a minimally invasive surgical procedure which demands high accuracy. In this respect, robotic systems with autonomous control algorithms have been exploited as the main tool to achieve high accuracy and reliability. However, for reasons of safety and acceptance by the surgical community, autonomous robotic control is not desirable. Thus, it is necessary to focus more on techniques enabling clinicians to directly control the motion of surgical tools. In this work we address that challenge and present a novel teleoperated robotic system able to steer flexible needles. The proposed system tracks the position of the needle using an ultrasound imaging system, and, from that, it computes needle's ideal position and orientation to reach a given target. The master haptic interface then provides mixed kinesthetic-vibratory navigation cues about this ideal position and orientation to the clinician as she steers the needle. Six subjects carried out an experiment of teleoperated needle insertion into a soft-tissue phantom. They showed a mean targeting error of 1.36 mm. An additional experiment of remote teleoperation has been carried out to highlight the passivity-based stability of the proposed system.",

We developed an on-board stereo-vision based mapping system, thereby introducing local obstacle maps that can directly be used for fast local obstacle avoidance and path planning. In addition, we designed them to constitute a suitable input to a widely-used simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. We performed experiments in unknown indoor, unstructured outdoor as well as mixed environments and demonstrated the applicability of our method to camera setups with small as well as wide field of view. In all three scenarios, we achieved a final 2D position error of less than 0.08% of the full trajectory.",

The aim of the Stochastic Collection and Replenishment (SCAR) scenario is to use dedicated agents to refuel, recharge, or otherwise replenish robots in the field to facilitate persistent autonomy. This paper explores the optimisation of the SCAR scenario with a single replenishment agent, using several different objective functions. The problem is framed as a combinatorial optimisation problem, and A* is used to find the optimal schedule. Through a computational study, a ratio objective function is shown to have superior performance compared with a total weighted tardiness objective function, with a greater performance advantage present when using shorter schedule lengths. The importance of incorporating uncertainty in the objective function used in the optimisation process is also highlighted, in particular for scenarios in which the replenishment agent is under- or fully-utilised.",

To date, the major limitation of the various additive manufacturing techniques is the limited range of print materials and properties, with 3d printed parts unable to be used in most load-bearing applications in robotics and other domains. In this paper, we present a technique for increasing the strength of 3d printed parts while retaining the benefits of the process such as ease and speed of implementation and complex part geometries. By carefully placing voids in the printed parts, which are later filled with higher-strength resins, we can improve the overall part strength and stiffness by up to 45% and 25%, respectively. We show three-point bend testing data comparing solid printed ABS samples with those strengthened through the fill compositing process, as well as examples of 3D printed parts used in robotic applications.",

In this paper, we describe a new method for enabling controllable adhesion, namely electroadhesion, for use in soft robots. We present a method to manufacture stretchable electroadhesive pads and characterize their performance when stretching the pad more than double its original length. Our results suggest that the normal detachment force per area slightly decreases with the stretching, while the shear detachment force per area increases with the stretch ratio. These results imply that stretchable electroadhesive pads have higher adaptivity than non-stretchable pads because their mechanical stiffness and adhesive forces can be controlled through stretching.",

In this paper, we demonstrate through the kinematics of concentric-tube robots, how this adverse effect of torsion could be reduced or potentially eliminated. As proof of principle, we demonstrate experimentally and numerically that by adopting tubular composite structures, such as multi-layer helical tubes or cellular tubes, that could be designed to exhibit higher torsional-to-bending stiffness ratio, the stability margin of concentric-tube robots can be improved up to 40%. This will allow concentric-tube robots to achieve even a higher dexterity within a more confined space.",

The reconfiguration of the CDPR is considered as a multi-objective optimization problem with two performance indices. One criterion is the sum of the cable tensions which is directly related to the power consumption of the CDPR. The other criterion is the normalized upper bound on the infinitesimal displacement of the mobile platform, used here as a means to quantify the stiffness of the CDPR. A systematic procedure is proposed to find optimal reconfigurations of the CDPR while dealing efficiently with the tradeoff between these two criteria.",

Our method acts at the very beginning of the detection process by using a corner occurrence model in order to predict the optimal threshold for a user-defined number of detections. Compared to existing approaches which guarantee a reasonable amount of corners by using a low threshold and then pruning the result, our approach is faster and more regular in terms of computation time as it avoids scoring and sorting the detected corners. Using the FAST detector as testbed, the strategy outlined in this article is evaluated in typical environments for robotics applications, and we report improved detection reliability during important scene variations. Taking into account the underlying visual navigation algorithms, we show that by regularizing the data input our solution facilitates a stable processing load, lower inter-frame computation time, and robustness to scene variations.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Current control strategies in physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) face some limitations: endpoint stiffness level is not directly measurable in typical haptic control situations and the bilateral nature of the interaction requires proper treatment of operator dynamics. These limitations have reduced current control approaches to estimation techniques based on correlated metrics, such as electromyographic (EMG) signals. The current study investigates a parameter known to represent the nullspace of the mapping from muscle forces to joint torques in the human musculoskeletal system, i.e., muscle co-activation. It is hypothesized that this parameter is a random variable that correlates with muscle activities, measured through EMG signals. A change in this variable directly affects endpoint stiffness, and therefore system performance and stability. This study additionally presents a methodology for processing EMG (cocontraction) data prior to training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, meant to be used as a decision tool for haptic impedance control. Results presented serve as a springboard for the incorporation of a human operator model suitable for real-time implementation and sufficient to support bilateral human-robot interaction. The long-term goals of this research are to understand the mechanisms governing neuromotor adaptation in pHRI, and ultimately design a novel haptic device that tunes its impedance gains in conjunction with changes in an operator's physical and cognitive state. Such implementation would improve the efficacy of robot co-workers operated in industrial settings, among other applications.",

        "abstract": "Surgeons perform minimally invasive surgery using an image delivered by a laparoscope and a camera system that provides a high definition 2D image, but this leaves the surgeon without 3D depth perception. The lack of depth perception can slow the surgeon, increase the risk of misidentifying structures, and/or inadvertently cause unwanted injury to tissues surrounding the surgical site. To address the lack of depth perception, we propose a Surgical Structured Light (SSL) system that includes a 3D sensor capable of measuring and modeling the surgical site during a procedure. The 3D information provided by this system can enable the surgeon to: 1) improve the navigation of tools based on precise localization of instruments in relation to structures in the surgical site, 2) allow 3D visualizations side-by-side with a standard 2D color image, and 3) precisely measure sizes of structures (e.g., tumors) and distances between structures with simple mouse clicks. We demonstrate the accuracy of our SSL system using ex-vivo data on both a cylinder calibration object as well as various plastic organs.",

        "abstract": "In biped walking, swing-leg retraction can reduce the energy loss at heel-strike by reducing the foot speed relative to the ground at touch-down. However, it also takes extra effort to brake and then accelerate the swing leg in the rearward direction. This energetic trade-off of retraction is influenced by the mechanical coupling with the stance leg preemptive push-off, and changes with different step lengths and speeds. Previously it has not been clear under which circumstances a retracting hip torque has a net energetic benefit (if ever). Here, using a simple biped model probed with numerical and analytic methods, we show how the effectiveness of leg retraction is influenced by actuator efficiencies for positive and negative work. As the efficiency of negative work decreases, the energetic advantage of retracting hip torque is found (mainly) for longer steps, whereas at shorter steps the hip joint extends (not retracts) prior to heel-strike. For fast walking, however, a braking hip torque is still required at the end of swing phase to ensure heel-strike.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new strategy for task space control in the cooperative manipulation framework. We extend the cooperative dual task-space (CDTS) - which uses dual quaternions to represent the bimanual manipulation-to explicitly regard self-motion dynamics that arise from redundant kinematics. In this sense, we propose a flexible task execution criterion that enriches the Jacobian null space with additional degrees of freedom by relaxing control requirements upon specific geometric task objectives. The criterion is satisfied with a hysteresis-based switching strategy that ensures stability and convergence upon traditional and relaxed constraints. Simulation results highlight the importance and effectiveness of the proposed technique.",

The proposed formulation does not require detailed information about the system model. A theoretical analysis shows that the controlled system's behavior matches closely to that of a nonadaptive reference system with fast adaptation. The tracking-synchronization objective is achieved despite the presence of actuator delay, communication delay, and the unknown dynamics of the platform. When there is no common desired trajectory, the modified controller drives all robots to a consensus configuration. The simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed control algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Many tasks in human environments require performing a sequence of navigation and manipulation steps involving objects. In unstructured human environments, the location and configuration of the objects involved often change in unpredictable ways. This requires a high-level planning strategy that is robust and flexible in an uncertain environment. We propose a novel dynamic planning strategy, which can be trained from a set of example sequences. High level tasks are expressed as a sequence of primitive actions or controllers (with appropriate parameters). Our score function, based on Markov Random Field (MRF), captures the relations between environment, controllers, and their arguments. By expressing the environment using sets of attributes, the approach generalizes well to unseen scenarios. We train the parameters of our MRF using a maximum margin learning method. We provide a detailed empirical validation of our overall framework demonstrating successful plan strategies for a variety of tasks.1",

The algorithm plans collision-free trajectories for the robots such that the figure appears visually consistent across frames including overlaps between body parts. We use 3D motion capture data as input to obtain clean stick figure images. The algorithm consists of three steps: segment generation, robot assignment, and trajectory optimization. In the segment generation step, the input 3D animation is converted to a set of segments of visible robot trajectories in the 2D image plane. The robot assignment step then assigns a robot to each segment using dynamic programming. Finally, the trajectory optimization step computes the complete collision-free trajectory for every robot, including when a robot is not assigned to any segment. We demonstrate the algorithm in simulation using up to 75 robots.",

Given a finite set of external disturbances representing the task to be executed, the concept of Q distance is introduced in a novel way to determine an efficient grasp with a task compatible hand posture (i.e., configuration and contact points). Our approach takes, also, into consideration the mechanical and geometric limitations imposed by the robotic hand design and the object to be grasped. In addition, incorporating our recent results on grasping [1], the ability of the robot hand to exert the required contact forces is maximized and robustness against positioning inaccuracies and object uncertainties is established. Finally, the efficiency of our approach is verified through an experimental study on the 15 DoF DLR/HIT II robotic hand attached at the end effector of the 7 DoF Mitsubishi PA10 robotic manipulator.",

The MRI-actuated catheters is a new robotic catheter concept which utilizes MRI for remote steering and guidance. Magnetic moments generated by a set of coils wound near the tip are used to steer the catheter under MRI scanner magnetic field. The catheter during an ablation procedure is modeled as a constrained robotic manipulator with flexible joints, and the proposed motion-planning algorithm calculates a sequence of magnetic moments based on the manipulator model to move the tip of the catheter along a predefined trajectory on the surface of the left atrium. The difficulties in motion planning of the catheter are due to kinematic redundancy and underactuation. The proposed motion planning algorithm overcomes the challenges by operating in the task space instead of the configuration space. The catheter is then regulated around this nominal trajectory using feedback control to reduce the effect of uncertainties.",

In this paper, we propose a mechanism to control the position and joint stiffness of a tendon-driven manipulator independently, using dedicated actuators. This mechanism consists of two parts: a component that transforms the movements of the tendons to activate the actuators, and a component that applies tensile forces to adjust the joint stiffness. We named this mechanism \u201ctendon routing resolving inverse kinematics\u201d (TRIK). The methodology for designing this mechanism for various tendon-driven manipulators is presented with several examples. We designed TRIK for a manipulator with one degree of freedom and nonconstant-moment arms.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The need for safe human-robot interaction in emerging robotic applications has recently driven the development of new range of actuation systems spanning from variable stiffness drives to variable damping or full variable impedance joints. Concerning the provision of variable physical damping in compliant actuators, the main objective is to improve the control of compliant joint. In a particular class of these variable physical damping actuators (VPDAs), the level of generated damping is realized by creating a friction force which is actively controlled by piezoelectric actuators (PEAs). Therefore, to effectively control the damping output, the accurate force control of the PEAs is required. However, difficulties to precisely control the generated piezoelectric force stem from its highly nonlinear behavior such as hysteresis and creep effect. This paper presents a novel practical force tracking controller for PEAs with unknown hysteresis behavior. The proposed control consists of two elements: terminal sliding-mode based desired dynamics injection and model-free compensation for nonlinear dynamics of PEAs, which allow fast convergence and extraordinary robustness to the closed-loop system. The stability of the overall system is proved in the sense of Lyapunov. On the real prototype of VPDA, the proposed control scheme is experimentally verified and analyzed by comparison to other controllers, demonstrating improved force tracking performance of PEAs in VPDA system.",

Equipping a quadrotor with low-friction wheels allows it to exploit efficient rolling locomotion to travel long distances on smooth surfaces \u2014 common in human environments. A novel feature of this approach is the use of skateboard steering trucks that use lateral tilt to affect steering. This allows existing quadrotor flight controls for driving without modification to the avionics. In this paper we present turning mechanics for driving along the ground and performance curves for the vehicle rolling over different surfaces. We show experimentally that the rolling range of a commercial off-the-shelf quadrotor greatly exceeds its flying range, despite the small added mass of rolling wheels.",

This was made possible by co-locating and jointly running this event with the Bomb Response Technology Seminar, an annual workshop for civilian and military bomb squad personnel. This event also builds on a decade-long legacy of response robotics dissemination events. These events leverage the DHS-NIST-ASTM International Standard Test Methods for Response Robots as a common language with which responders, researchers, industry, students and test administrators may communicate their requirements, capabilities and motivations. It builds on the 2012 IEEE-RAS Safety, Security and Rescue Robotics Summer School and sets the stage for the 2014 IEEERAS Response Robotics Summer School.",

        "abstract": "As the prevalence of autonomous agents grows, so does the number of interactions between these agents. Therefore, it is desirable for these agents to be capable of banding together with previously unknown teammates towards a common goal: to collaborate without pre-coordination. While past research on ad hoc teamwork has focused mainly on theoretical treatments and empirical studies in relatively simple domains, the long-term vision has been to enable robots and other autonomous agents to exhibit the sort of flexibility and adaptability on complex tasks that people do, for example when they play games of \u201cpick-up\u201d basketball or soccer. This paper introduces a series of pick-up robot soccer experiments that were carried out in three different leagues at the international RoboCup competition in 2013. In all cases, agents from different labs were put on teams with no pre-coordination. This paper introduces the structure of these experiments, describes the strategies used by UT Austin Villa in each challenge, and analyzes the results. The paper's main contribution is the introduction of a new large-scale ad hoc teamwork testbed that can serve as a starting point for future experimental ad hoc teamwork research.",

        "abstract": "Numerous legged robots have demonstrated the effectiveness of tuned leg impedance to achieve dynamically stable running and hopping. However, selecting appropriate impedance values for new machines remains challenging. This paper investigates the effect of joint impedance selection on locomotion stability and efficiency by analyzing a simulation model of the MIT Cheetah quadruped robot performing a trot gait. An exhaustive search of impedance parameters of the knee and hip shows that locomotion stability is highly sensitive to knee impedance and insensitive to hip impedance. Inspection of simulations operating during a ground-height disturbance reveals why: During a disturbance response most of the variation in work performed in the legs occurs in the knee joints. Mechanical work data from the MIT Cheetah exhibits close experimental agreement with the simulation predictions. The exhaustive search also reveals that, within the range of impedance parameters that can achieve stable locomotion, joint impedance values do not have a significant effect on the mechanical cost of transport. These results indicate that the dynamic response of the leg-extension degree of freedom is of primary importance to achieving dynamically stable running, and that robust stability may be achieved with minimal compromise of locomotion efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Reach-to-grasp movements are widely observed in activities of daily living, particularly in tool manipulations. In order to reduce the complexity in redundancy resolution and facilitate upper-limb exoskeleton control in reach-to-grasp tasks, we studied joint coordination in the human arm during such movements. Experimental data were collected on reach-to-grasp movements in a 3-dimensional (3D) workspace for cylinder targets of different positions and grasping orientations. For comparison, reaching movements toward the same targets are also recorded. In the kinematic analysis, the redundant degree of freedom in human arm is represented by the swivel angle. The four grasping-relevant degrees of freedom (GR-DOFs), including the swivel angle and the three wrist joints, behave differently in reach-to-grasp movements comparing to how they behave in reaching movements. The ratio of active motion range (R-AMR) is proposed for quantitatively comparison the task-relevance of the GR-DOFs. Analysis on the R-AMR values shows that the task-relevant GR-DOFs are more actively used, while the task-irrelevant joints are left uncontrolled and maintain their neutral positions. Among the task-relevant GR-DOFs, the smaller joints (micro-structure) are more actively used than the larger joints (macro-structure). The coordination of the task-relevant GR-DOFs is shown to be synergistic. Analysis of the acceleration/deceleration at the GR-DOFs indicates different levels of voluntary control in three phases of the movements. The study of the characteristics of the joint coordination in reach-to-grasp movements provides guide-lines for simplifying the control of the upper limb exoskeleton.",

        "abstract": "We study the lion-and-man game in which a group of lions (the pursuers) try to capture a man (the evader). The players have equal speed. They can observe each other at all times. While the game is well-studied in planar domains such as polygons, very little is known about its properties in higher dimensions. In this paper, we study the lion and man game when played on the surface of a genus-zero polyhedron with boundary. We show that three lions with non-zero capture distance \u03b4 can capture the man in time O((A/\u03b42 + L/\u03b4)2 \u03b4/2) where A is the area of the surface, and L is the total edge length of the surface.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we report on the development of a modular multi-DoF F/T sensor and its use in the implementation of a sensorized object capable of multi-touch detection. The sensor is composed of six 6-axis F/T sensors spatially organized on the faces of a cube. Different calibration methods are presented to directly tackle the coupling phenomena inherent to the spatial organization of the faces and the lightweight construction of the sensor which would have, otherwise, degraded its accuracy. To assess the performances of the calibration methods, a comparison is reported with respect to the measurements obtained with a commercial force/torque sensor considered as ground truth (ATI Delta). Thanks to the modular design and the possibility to cover the sensitive faces with surface patches of different geometry, a variety of sensorized objects with different shapes can be realized. The peculiar feature that all the components of the contact wrench can be measured on each face with high accuracy, renders it a unique tool in the study of grasp force distribution in humans, with envisioned use both in neuroscience investigations and robotic applications.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of searching for an unknown moving target in a bounded two-dimensional convex area with a mobile robot. A key component of designing a search strategy is the target motion model, which is often unknown in practical scenarios. When designing search strategies, researchers either (1) ignore the target motion and treat the target as a stationary object with unknown location, (2) treat the target as an adversary and model the search task as a game, or (3) use a stochastic model such as a random walk. For each of these models we analyze possible search paths with the objective of minimizing the expected capture time. Our intent is to investigate how the choice of the model influences the choice of the strategy and consequently how the capture time will depend on this choice. In addition to a theoretical analysis, we compare the strategies in simulation.",

        "abstract": "While decades of work and hundreds of research papers exist on unicycle robot control, the control of skid-steer robots is not yet as standardized due to the complexity of wheel slipping behavior. This work presents a method of utilizing the track or wheel Instantaneous Centers of Rotation (ICRs) on a skid-steer vehicle to map skid-steer dynamics to an equivalent time-varying model of unicycle dynamics. This allows for the direct implementation of existing unicycle, or Hilare type, robot trajectory controllers. Knowledge of ICR locations enables the calculation of required track or wheel speeds to create desired vehicle movement, similar to the kinematic relations resulting from the no-slip assumption of a unicycle robot. The algorithm requires no prior knowledge of vehicle dimensions or terrain parameters because ICR locations are estimated during robot operation using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Simulation and experimental results for a wheeled skid-steer vehicle show good trajectory tracking performance.",

The 3D assembly of cells in vitro is one of the important techniques to reveal cell growth, differentiation and hystogenesis. The techniques can be used for applications in tissue engineering, drug screening, and cell characterization. The multi-cell spheroids were used as building blocks for 3D structure, and thermoresponsive gel was used for spheroids assembly. The mouse myoblast cells C2C12 and mouse fibroblast cells NIH 3T3 were cultured in an ultra-low atachment surface flask. The cells were naturally aggregated in the flask and cell spheroids were prepared in self-assembly process. The rat liver cell RLC-18 was also cultured to prepare spheroids. The thermoresponsive Gel probe (GeT probe) we proposed was employed for assembly of the prepared spheroids in 3D. The handled spheroids by GeT probe were cultured inside the thermoresponsive gel and the cell viability was confirmed. The cultured structure was handled by the GeT probe for further assembly. The results validate that the GeT probe can manipulate spheroids with keeping live condition of cells and achieve 3D cell assembly inside the thermoresponsive gel with arbitrary and precise patterning.",

The gesture or the orientation of the oocyte is critical for improving the enucleation success rate, and characteristics investigation of the oocyte. Cell rotation in conventional approaches mainly are electrorotation or manual operation by skilled professionals based on trial-and-error, repeating the vacuum aspiration and release. The poor reproducibility and inconsistency entail a simple and convenient approach for single oocyte rotation. This paper reports a 3-D rotational control of bovine oocyte. By using customer designed magnetically driven microtool (MMT), the oocyte orientation control could be achieved. Comparing with the conventional works, rotation control by using MMT shows great advantage in control accuracy and the rotation speed. Orientation with an accuracy of 7\u00b0, and the average rotation velocity of 3 rad/s have been achieved. Rotation by utilizing MMT demonstrated overall out-of-plane and in-plane in a quite simple way. And by utilizing this approach, the cell manipulation for cell study becomes much easier on investigating single cell characteristics and analysis mechanism properties.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method that enables a team of aerial robots to enclose a target in 3D space by attaining a desired geometric formation around it. We propose an approach in which each robot obtains its motion commands using measurements of the relative position of the other agents and of the target, without the need for a central coordinator. As contribution, our method permits any desired 3D target enclosing configuration to be defined, in contrast with the planar circular patterns commonly encountered in the literature. The proposed control strategy relies on the minimization of a cost function that captures the collective motion objective. In our method, the robots do not need to use a common reference frame. This coordinate independence is achieved through the introduction in the cost function of a rotation matrix computed locally by each robot. We prove that our motion controller is exponentially stable, and illustrate its performance through simulations.",

While the accurate navigation capability is strongly required for successful 3D reconstruction, global positioning system (GPS) signals which are essential for accurate navigation are severely deteriorated near the bridge structures or almost completely blocked underneath the bridge decks. In this study, a parameterized feature map is introduced by augmenting the map state with the geometric parameters of the detected bridge piers, and relative navigation is performed with respect to this map in the framework of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). This parameterized SLAM approach allows for high-precision navigation and mapping with no need of GPS fixes. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm was demonstrated through field experiments.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The current paper proposes a trajectory optimization approach for navigating a non-holonomic wheeled mobile robot in dynamic environments. The dynamic obstacle's motion is not known and hence is represented by a band of predicted trajectories. The trajectory optimization can account for large number of predicted obstacle trajectories and seeks to avoid each predicted trajectory of every obstacle in the sensing range of the robot. The two primary contributions of the proposed trajectory optimization are (1): A computationally efficient method for computing the intersection space of collision avoidance constraints of large number of predicted obstacle trajectories. (2): A optimization framework to connect the current state to the solution space in time optimal fashion. The intersection/solution space computation is build on our earlier proposed concept of time scaled collision cone, which can be solved in closed form to obtain a set of formulae. These formulae describe how much and in what manner the temporal specification of a trajectory needs to be changed to avoid a given set of dynamic obstacles. This allows us to quickly evaluate solution space of time scaled collision cone over various candidate trajectories, thus reducing the problem of computing the intersection space to that of generating multiple homotopic trajectories. The optimization framework used to connect the current state to the solution space in time optimal fashion is based on the concept of non-linear time scaling, which induces a difference of convex form structure. Thus, on the theoretical side, we show that the various components of the proposed framework are computationally simple and involves solving sets of linear equations and using state of the art convex programming techniques. On the practical side we show that the proposed planner performs better than sampling based planners which treat dynamic obstacles as static over a short duration of time",

        "abstract": "Current GPS-based devices have difficulty localizing in cases where the GPS signal is unavailable or insufficiently accurate. This paper presents an algorithm for localizing a vehicle on an arbitrary road network using vision, road curvature estimates, or a combination of both. The method uses an extension of topometric localization, which is a hybrid between topological and metric localization. The extension enables localization on a network of roads rather than just a single, non-branching route. The algorithm, which does not rely on GPS, is able to localize reliably in situations where GPS-based devices fail, including \u201curban canyons\u201d in downtown areas and along ambiguous routes with parallel roads. We demonstrate the algorithm experimentally on several road networks in urban, suburban, and highway scenarios. We also evaluate the road curvature descriptor and show that it is effective when imagery is sparsely available.",

A third strategy commands joint angles, velocities, and torques based on the recorded feedback from the robot while executing a previously defined motion under position control. The three control strategies are implemented and compared on a snake robot that includes series elastic actuation (SEA) and torque sensing at each joint, and demonstrate compliant locomotion that adapts automatically to the robot's surrounding terrain.",

        "abstract": "This work contributes to the development of active haptic exploration strategies of surfaces using robotic hands in environments with an unknown structure. The architecture of the proposed approach consists two main Bayesian models, implementing the touch attention mechanisms of the system. The model \u03c0per perceives and discriminates different categories of materials (haptic stimulus) integrating compliance and texture features extracted from haptic sensory data. The model \u03c0tar actively infers the next region of the workspace that should be explored by the robotic system, integrating the task information, the permanently updated saliency and uncertainty maps extracted from the perceived haptic stimulus map, as well as, inhibition-of-return mechanisms. The experimental results demonstrate that the Bayesian model \u03c0per can be used to discriminate 10 different classes of materials with an average recognition rate higher than 90%. The generalization capability of the proposed models was demonstrated experimentally. The ATLAS robot, in the simulation, was able to perform the following of a discontinuity between two regions made of different materials with a divergence smaller than 1cm (30 trials). The tests were performed in scenarios with 3 different configurations of the discontinuity. The Bayesian models have demonstrated the capability to manage the uncertainty about the structure of the surfaces and sensory noise to make correct motor decisions from haptic percepts.",

        "abstract": "The ability to measure human hand motions and interaction forces is critical to improving our understanding of manual gesturing and grasp mechanics. This knowledge serves as a basis for developing better tools for human skill training and rehabilitation, exploring more effective methods of designing and controlling robotic hands, and creating more sophisticated human-computer interaction devices which use complex hand motions as control inputs. This paper presents work on the design, fabrication, and experimental validation of a soft sensor-embedded glove which measures both hand motion and contact pressures during human gesturing and manipulation tasks. We design an array of liquid-metal embedded elastomer sensors to measure up to hundreds of Newtons of interaction forces across the human palm during manipulation tasks and to measure skin strains across phalangeal and carpal joints for joint motion tracking. The elastomeric sensors provide the mechanical compliance necessary to accommodate anatomical variations and permit a normal range of hand motion. We explore methods of assembling this soft sensor glove from modular, individually fabricated pressure and strain sensors and develop design guidelines for their mechanical integration. Experimental validation of a soft finger glove prototype demonstrates the sensitivity range of the designed sensors and the mechanical robustness of the proposed assembly method, and provides a basis for the production of a complete soft sensor glove from inexpensive modular sensor components.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a technique for automated intraocular laser surgery using a handheld micromanipulator known as Micron. The novel handheld manipulator enables the automated scanning of a laser probe within a cylinder of 4 mm long and 4 mm in diameter. For the automation, the surface of the retina is reconstructed using a stereomicroscope, and then preplanned targets are placed on the surface. The laser probe is precisely located on the target via visual servoing of the aiming beam, while maintaining a specific distance above the surface. In addition, the system is capable of tracking the surface of the eye in order to compensate for any eye movement introduced during the operation. We compared the performance of the automated scanning using various control thresholds, in order to find the most effective threshold in terms of accuracy and speed. Given the selected threshold, we conducted the handheld operation above a fixed target surface. The average error and execution time are reduced by 63.6% and 28.5%, respectively, compared to the unaided trials. Finally, the automated laser photocoagulation was demonstrated also in an eye phantom, including compensation for the eye movement.",

We propose a novel 6D RGBD odometry approach that finds the relative camera pose between consecutive RGB-D frames by keypoint extraction and feature matching both on the RGB and depth image planes. Furthermore, we feed the estimated pose to the highly accurate KinectFusion algorithm, which uses a fast ICP (Iterative-Closest-Point) to fine-tune the frame-to-frame relative pose and fuse the Depth data into a global implicit surface. We evaluate our method on a publicly available RGB-D SLAM benchmark dataset by Sturm et al. The experimental results show that our proposed reconstruction method solely based on visual odometry and KinectFusion outperforms the state-of-the-art RGB-D SLAM system accuracy. Our algorithm outputs a ready-to-use polygon mesh (highly suitable for creating 3D virtual worlds) without any post-processing steps.",

In order to decode the signal carried out by the LED beacons, we propose two reliable solutions using common sensors available on consumer electronic devices. Firstly, we introduce a dedicated analog sensor, which can be directly connected to the microphone input of a computer or a smart phone. It decodes both the signal pattern and signal strength of a beacon. Secondly, we utilize rolling-shutter cameras to decode the signal pattern, providing potential solutions to the localization of hand-held devices with cameras. In contrast to existing widely-applied indoor localization approaches, like vision-based and laser-based methods, our approach reveals its advantages as low-cost, globally consistent and it retains the potential applications using Visible Light Communication(VLC). We also study the characteristics of the proposed solutions under typical indoor conditions by experiments.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Transfemoral amputees often suffer from falls and a fear of falling that leads to a decreased quality of life. Existing control strategies for powered knee-ankle prostheses demonstrate only limited ability to react to disturbances that induce falls such as trips, slips, and obstacles. In contrast, prior work on neuromuscular modeling of human locomotion suggests that control strategies based on local reflexes exhibit robustness to unobserved terrain such as slopes and steps. Therefore, we propose that a powered knee-ankle prosthesis governed by reflexive local controls will more competently adapt to unperceived disturbances. To test this hypothesis, we simulate a neuromuscular model of a transfemoral amputee walking over rough ground with a powered knee-ankle prosthesis governed by the proposed reflexive controller. We show that the proposed control allows the amputee to walk farther over rough ground than does the state-of-the-art control. The proposed controller also more readily rejects deviations from nominal walking gaits such as those encountered during a trip. These results suggest that applying the proposed control to a powered knee-ankle prosthesis will substantially improve amputee gait stability.",

        "abstract": "Tasks that are too hard for single robot can be easily carried out by multiple robots in a cooperative manner. If some/all robots have mobile bases, the cooperation is subjected to great uncertainties in both the robotic system and environment. Therefore, the relationships among all the base frames (robot-robot calibration) and the relationships between the end-effectors and the other devices such as cameras and tools (hand-eye and tool-flange calibrations) have to be calculated to enable the robots to cooperate. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a simultaneous hand-eye, tool-flange and robot-robot calibration method. Thorough simulations are conducted to show the superiority of the proposed simultaneous method under different noise levels and various numbers of robot movements. Furthermore, the comparison to two non-simultaneous calibration methods has also been carried out to show the efficiency and robustness of the proposed simultaneous method.",

Variable stiffness model of the twisted string actuator is identified empirically, and the control strategy is proposed for simultaneous position and stiffness control of the actuator. A variable stiffness linear joint actuated by antagonistic twisted string actuators is proposed as a target system. The proposed model and control strategy make it possible to control the position and the stiffness of the joint without position and force sensor at the load side. The developed variable stiffness linear joint can be effectively used in applications where weight distribution is vital, such as exoskeleton systems and low weight manipulators.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Insects are able to create complex wing trajectories using power and steering muscles attached to the wing/thorax oscillation system. In this paper, we propose a dynamic model for such an oscillation system, and study its dynamic behavior. In particular, we model the wing as a rigid body with three degrees of freedom. The power muscle is modeled by a torque actuator and a torsional spring creating basic wing flapping (stroke) motion. Torsional springs at the wing longitudinal rotation and deviation axes are used to mimic the steering muscles. Aerodynamic forces and moments are calculated using blade-element analysis and quasi-steady aerodynamic model. Dimensional analysis shows that the dynamic behavior of the system is determined by the three spring coefficients and the input torque coefficient, and is characterized by four basic patterns of wing trajectories. By exploring the parameter space of these coefficients, we found that the wing trajectory that most similar to those of a real insect generates the best lift and power loading. Furthermore, a hybrid optimization algorithm is implemented to find the optimal stiffness coefficients that maximize the power loading. Notably, the results also indicate that the flapping trajectories with out-of-plane deviation achieve a better aerodynamic performance than those without it. The oscillatory property of this system does not only explain how insects use flight muscles to tune wing kinematics, but also allows for design simplifications of the wing driving mechanism of flapping micro air vehicles.",

The trajectories are guaranteed to be kine-matically feasible, i.e., they respect the robot's acceleration and deceleration capabilities as well as its maximum steering angle and steering rate. Their costs are computed using LiDAR and camera data and depend on factors such as proximity to obstacles, curvature, changes of curvature, and slope. In a second step, velocities for the least-cost trajectory are adjusted based on the dynamics of the vehicle. When the robot is faced with an obstacle on its trajectory, the planner is restarted to compute an alternative trajectory. Our algorithm is robust against GPS error and waypoints placed in obstacle-filled areas. It was successfully used at euRathlon 20131, where our autonomous vehicle MuCAR-3 took first place in the \u201cAutonomous Navigation\u201d scenario.",

The planner reasons about the availability of contingency maneuvers needed in case of any of the civilian vessels breaches the International Regulations for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). Our exploratory study indicated that implementing the envisioned planner requires significant speed up of trajectory planning to cope with the dynamics of the scene, and evaluation of collision risk. We describe a new method for efficiently searching 5D state space for a dynamically feasible trajectory using adaptive control action primitives. The algorithm estimates the congestion of the state space regions to evaluate collision risk, and then dynamically scales action primitives used during the search while preserving their dynamical feasibility. Our simulation experiments demonstrate that this leads to a substantial increase in the search efficiency and a decrease in the number of collisions, especially in complex scenarios with a higher number of civilian vessels.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the problem of transfer learning in the context of object recognition in a heterogeneous robot team. We specifically look at the case where robots individually learn object classifiers and must then transfer the resulting learned knowledge to another robot. Recent trends in computer vision and robotics have moved towards feature representation learning, where the underlying feature representation used in classification is learned in a data-driven way. This poses a problem to knowledge transfer, as the underlying representations learned by different robots will differ significantly. In this paper, we present several hypotheses with regard to knowledge transfer in such a scenario, specifically that 1) the transfer of knowledge will be most effective if it involves not just the classifier itself, but the learned feature representations themselves, 2) this is not a problem because given similar scenes and objects, some methods such as sparse coding are able to learn representations that can be successfully used by another robot, and 3) a codebook encoding scheme such as Fisher vectors will result in a smaller reduction in accuracy after transfer even if the receiving robot uses its own learned feature representation. Finally, we contribute an alignment procedure and demonstrate that it can serve to facilitate knowledge transfer even when the underlying feature representations are independently learned by each robot and codebook methods are not used. We test all three of the hypotheses and the alignment procedure on a real-world dataset consisting of two robots viewing the same 12 objects using cameras with differing characteristics.",

        "abstract": "Passivity-based bilateral teleoperation control systems can offer robust stability against arbitrarily large communication delays at the expense of poor transparency. In fact, most passive control frameworks are designed for a particular task and do not adjust transparency when transitioning between different environments. This paper presents a bilateral control strategy that passively compensates transparency when transitioning between free motion and hard contact motion scenarios. The proposed control framework exploits the effect that the wave impedance (a design parameter of the passivity-based scattering transformation) has on transparency without compromising closed-loop stability regardless of time-varying communication delays. To adjust transparency, the control scheme smoothly switches the wave impedance between a low value, ideal for free motion, and a sufficiently large value, suited for hard contact scenarios. We show, by rigorous mathematical treatment and simulations, that the proposed control strategy can effectively adjust the transparency of the system without compromising stability.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports on the optimized path-planning for an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) serving as a communication and navigation aid (CNA) for multiple unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) performing surveys. This path-planning can occur prior to the survey (pre-deployment mode) based on the original planned paths for the survey UUVs or during the survey (underway mode) using in situ UUV positions reported acoustically by the survey UUVs. The underway mode has the advantage of integrating the actual UUV paths which may differ from the planned ones due to currents, re-planned missions, etc. This planner considers the relative depth of the CNA and survey UUVs, allowing the CNA to effectively aid survey UUVs in maintaining altitude over the sea floor, as is done in some UUV surveys. Results are presented from simulations and in-water validation trials for both path-planning modes. The underway planning mode is preferred since it adapts to changes in the survey UUV path during the mission. The advantage of bounding the distance between the CNA and any survey UUV to limit the survey UUVs' position error is also highlighted.",

The system is also able to monitor the execution of motion trajectories for intruding dynamic obstacles and triggers a replanning or stops the execution. The presented collision detection is deployed in local dynamic planning with live pointcloud data as well as in global a-priori planning.

Autonomous data collection requires optimizing the trajectory of a mobile vehicle to collect data from a number of stationary sensors in a known configuration. The proposed approach utilizes the self-organizing map (SOM) architecture to provide a unified solution to multi-goal path planning problems. Our approach applies to cases where the vehicle must move within a radius of a sensor to collect data and also where some sensors can be ignored due to a lower priority. We compare our proposed approach to state-of-the-art approximate solutions to variants of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for random deployments and in an underwater monitoring application domain. Our results demonstrate that the SOM approach outperforms combinatorial heuristic algorithms and also provides a unified approach for solving variants of the multi-goal path planning problem.",

        "abstract": "Recent work [1], [2] has shown promising results in enabling robotic manipulation of deformable objects through learning from demonstrations. Their method computes a registration from training scene to test scene, and then applies an extrapolation of this registration to the training scene gripper motion to obtain the gripper motion for the test scene. The warping cost of scene-to-scene registrations is used to determine the nearest neighbor from a set of training demonstrations. Then once the gripper motion has been generalized to the test situation, they apply trajectory optimization [3] to plan for the robot motions that will track the predicted gripper motions. In many situations, however, the predicted gripper motions cannot be followed perfectly due to, for example, joint limits or obstacles. In this case the past work finds a path that minimizes deviation from the predicted gripper trajectory as measured by its Euclidean distance for position and angular distance for orientation. Measuring the error this way during the motion planning phase, however, ignores the underlying structure of the problem-namely the idea that rigid registrations are preferred to generalize from training scene to test scene. Deviating from the gripper trajectory predicted by the extrapolated registration effectively changes the warp induced by the registration in the part of the space where the gripper trajectories are. The main contribution of this paper is an algorithm that considers this effective final warp as the criterion to optimize for in a unified optimization that simultaneously considers the scene-to-scene warping and the robot trajectory (which were separated into two sequential steps by the past work). This results in an approach that adjusts to infeasibility in a way that adapts directly to the geometry of the scene and minimizes the introduction of additional warping cost. In addition, this paper proposes to learn the motion of the gripper pads, whereas past work consid... Show More",

We propose an approach that makes it possible to detect, learn and recognize these objects through a multi-view model, using only a planar laser range finder. We show using a supervised approach that despite the limited information provided by the sensor, it is possible to recognize efficiently up to 22 different object, with a low computing cost while taking advantage of the large field of view of the sensor. We also propose an online, incremental and unsupervised approach that make it possible to continuously discover and learn all kind of dynamic elements encountered by the robot including people and objects.",

        "abstract": "An unsupervised attention-path planning algorithm is proposed and applied to large unknown area classification with small field-of-view cameras. Attention-path planning is formulated as the sequential feature selection problem that greedily finds a sequence of attentions to obtain more informative observations, yielding faster training and higher accuracies. In order to find the near-optimal attention-path, adaptive submodular optimization is employed, where the objective function for the internal belief is adaptive submodular and adaptive monotone. First, the amount of information of attention areas is modeled as the dissimilarity variance among the environment data set. With this model, the information gain function is defined as a function of variance reduction that has been shown to be submodular and monotone in many cases. Furthermore, adapting to increasing numbers of observations, each information gain for attention areas is iteratively updated by discarding the non-informative prior knowledge, enabling to maximize the expected information gain. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified through experiments that can significantly enhance the environment classification accuracy, with reduced number of limited field of view observations.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel unified framework for unsupervised object individuation from RGB-D image sequences. The proposed framework integrates existing location-based and feature-based object segmentation methods to achieve both computational efficiency and robustness in unstructured and dynamic situations. Based on the infant's object indexing theory, the newly proposed ambiguity graph plays as a key component of the framework to detect falsely segmented objects and rectify them by using both location and feature information. In order to evaluate the proposed method, three table-top multiple object manipulation scenarios were performed: stacking, unstacking, and occluding tasks. The results showed that the proposed method is more robust than the location-only method and more efficient than the feature-only method.",

Estimating their shape inside the body and combining it with 3D preoperative scans of the anatomy enable the surgeon to visualize how the entire robot interacts with the internal organs. As the robot progresses inside the body, the position and orientation of every link comprising the robot, evolves over a coordinate-free Lie algebra, se(3). To capture the full motion and uncertainty of the system, we use an extended Kalman filter where the state vector is defined using elements of se(3). We show that this approach describes the shape of the robot more accurately, than the ones where the state vector is a conventional parametrization, such as Cartesian coordinates and Euler angles. We perform two experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new filtering approach.",

A critical challenge to accomplishing this task is the vast search space that arises when considering multiple interacting bodies. To manage this complexity, we introduce an approach which efficiently reasons by back-propagating physical constraints between useful combinations of objects. This approach allows us to exploit restrictions on relative object configurations to reduce the search space prior to committing to specific object choices. We present a simulated implementation of our approach applied to the problem of opening a jammed door. Our method allows a robot to efficiently choose between two strategies, leverage and impact, to achieve the desired result using various available objects.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Increasingly widespread available haptic sensors mounted on articulated hands offer new sensory channels that can complement shape extraction from vision to enable a more robust handling of objects in cases when vision is restricted or even unavailable. However, to estimate object shape from haptic interaction data is a difficult challenge due to the complexity of the contact interaction between the movable object and sensor surfaces, leading to a coupled estimation problem of shape and object pose. While for vision efficient solutions to the underlying SLAM problem are known, the available information is much sparser in the tactile case, posing great difficulties for a straightforward adoption of standard SLAM algorithms. In the present paper, we thus explore whether a biologically inspired model based on dynamic neural fields can offer a route towards a practical algorithm for tactile SLAM. Our study is focused on a restricted scenario where a two-fingered robot hand manipulates an n-gon with a fixed rotational axis. We demonstrate that our model can accumulate shape information from reasonably short interaction sequences and autonomously build a representation despite significant ambiguity of the tactile data due to the rotational periodicity of the object. We conclude that the presented framework may be a suitable basis to solve the tactile SLAM problem also in more general settings which will be the focus of subsequent work.",

Estimating the applied force from endoscopic images is a promising approach, especially using binocular images. However, many existing operation rooms are only equipped with monocular endoscopes, making force estimation more problematic. In this paper a new method for estimating the applied force from monocular endoscope images is proposed. The main contribution is the concept of virtual template that enables modeling of surface deformation without the knowledge of the undeformed shape. Results of the in vitro experiment with the lamb liver support the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Although many methods have been proposed to avoid interrupting groups of people engaged in a conversation, just a few works have considered the proper way of joining those groups. Research in the field of social sciences have proposed geometric models to compute the best points to join a group. In this article we propose a method to use those points as possible destinations when driving a robotic wheelchair. Those points are considered together with other possible destinations in the environment such as points of interest or typical static destinations defined by the user's habits. The intended destination is inferred using a Dynamic Bayesian Network that takes into account the contextual information of the environment and user's orders to compute the probability for each destination.",

The system processes spatial referencing language and extracts a tree structure of language chunks. The spatial language system is then grounded to a robot navigation instruction in the form of a sequence of actions based on spatial references to furniture and room structure; the best navigation instruction is selected by scoring. In addition, the Reference-Direction-Target (RDT) model is proposed to represent indoor robot actions. To control the robot for the fetch task, a behavior model is designed based on the RDT model. An assistive robot has been designed and programmed based on this system. The proposed spatial language grounding model and robot behavior model are tested experimentally in three sets of experiments. Results show that the system enables a robot to follow spatial language commands in a physical indoor environment even if the referenced furniture items are re-positioned.",

In particular, wearable applications would benefit from variable stiffness materials in the context of active braces that may stiffen when necessary and soften when mobility is required. In this work, we present fibers capable of adjusting to provide variable stiffness in wearable fabrics. The variable stiffness fibers are made from shape memory materials, where shape memory alloy (SMA) is coated with a thin film of shape memory polymer (SMP). The fibers, which are fabricated via a continuous feed-through process, reduce in bending stiffness by an order of magnitude when the SMP goes through the glass transition. The transition between rubbery and glassy state is accomplished by direct joule heating of the embedded SMA wire. We employ a COMSOL model to relate the current input to the time required for the fibers to transition between stiffness states. Finally, we demonstrate how this device can be worn and act as a joint stability brace on human fingers.",

        "abstract": "Automated sewing is a complicated task in manufacturing. Due to the non-rigid work pieces and variations in the material characteristics, sensor-based control has to be used to accomplish the sewing operation. This paper presents a strategy for velocity synchronization and corner matching in an automated sewing cell based on two industrial manipulators and a sewing machine. A hybrid force/motion control scheme is adopted using feedback from force/torque sensors for tension control and optical sensors to control the seam position. The strategy is based on switching between force control and displacement control using a leader/follower coordination scheme. This addresses the problem of corner mismatch occurring when two independent force controllers are used for controlling the two robots. Experiments verify that the proposed method gives a satisfactory corner matching, which is crucial for the presented sewing case.",

        "abstract": "Robots walking under hybrid zero dynamics (HZD)-based control are susceptible to velocity disturbances because the controller is typically designed for one speed. LQR-based orbital stabilization control is one means to address this issue using feedback on the unactuated velocity. The approach, though, is difficult to implement in real time experimentally even on planar bipeds with relatively few links. This work extracts simple heuristics from simulated planar bipeds rejecting velocity disturbances under orbital stabilization control to approximate that functionality. The heuristics are layered on top of traditional HZD-based control of a five-link planar biped robot for experimental validation. Results show that the heuristically modified controller yields more efficient and more stable walking for the biped than does HZD-based control alone. It also enables rejection of larger decelerating disturbances and more rapid return to the desired walking cycle.",

        "abstract": "Navigation algorithms are fundamental for mobile robots. While the correctness of the algorithms is important, it is equally important that they do not fail because of bugs in their implementation. Yet, even widely-used robot navigation code lacks proofs of correctness or credible coverage reports from testing. Robot software developers usually point towards the cost of manual verification or lack of automated tools that would handle their code. We demonstrate that the choice of programming language is essential both for finding bugs in the code and for proving their absence. Our re-implementation of three robot navigation algorithms in SPARK revealed bugs that for years have not been detected in their original code in C/C++. For one of the implementations we demonstrate that it is free from run-time errors. Our code and results are available online to encourage uptake by the robot software developers community.",

However, vibration may still occur that limits the utilization of these manipulators for the operations at high speed. In this study, we cope with the residual vibration of the 3P(S)4 parallel mechanism that occurs at the end of high-speed motion. First, by using Lagrangian formulation, inverse dynamics of the mechanism is analyzed to linearize the system. To achieve robust control against residual vibration at high speed, Quantitative Feedback Theory is applied that utilizes templates and offers design transparency. As the challenge in this study is vibration, this frequency-domain robust control design approach has a potential to solve it. Verification of the applied method is conducted through high-speed motion experiments with PID and QFT methods. Settling time with QFT is 72% smaller compare to PID control.",

The main contributions are: a utility function to rank the views and an evaluation strategy implemented as a series of filters. Given that the candidate views are configurations, motion planning is solved using a rapidly-exploring random tree. The system is experimentally evaluated in simulation, contrasting it with previous work. We also present experiments with a real mobile manipulator robot, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.",

We focus on situations where the UGV navigates in remote areas with few man-made structures. This is a difficult problem due to the drastic change in perspective between the ground and aerial imagery and the lack of environmental features for image comparison. We do not rely on GPS, which may be jammed or uncertain. We propose a two-step approach: (1) the UGV images are warped to obtain a bird's eye view of the ground, and (2) this view is compared to a grid of satellite locations using whole-image descriptors. We analyze the performance of a variety of descriptors for different satellite map sizes and various terrain and environment types. We incorporate the air-ground matching into a particle-filter framework for localization using the best-performing descriptor. The results show that vision-based UGV localization from satellite maps is not only possible, but often provides better position estimates than GPS estimates, enabling us to improve the location estimates of Google Street View.",

We use binary markers to aid in block identification and localization, a custom 3D-printed gripper for robust grasping, and planning algorithms to determine the grasp sequence.

Nevertheless, the success of these tasks could not be possible without a highly accurate localization which can, unfortunately be often laborious. Here we provide a multiple usage localization algorithm based on vision only. However, a major drawback with vision-based algorithms is the lack of robustness. Most of the approaches are sensitive to scene variations (like season or environment changes) due to the fact that they use the Sum of Squared Differences (SSD). To prevent that, we choose to use the Mutual Information (MI) which is very robust toward local and global scene variations. However, dense approaches are often related to drift disadvantages. Here, we solve this problem by using georeferenced images. The localization algorithm has been implemented and experimental results are presented demonstrating the localization of a hexarotor UAV fitted with a downward looking camera during real flight tests.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports on the problem of map-based visual localization in urban environments for autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars have become a reality on roadways and are going to be a consumer product in the near future. One of the most significant road-blocks to autonomous vehicles is the prohibitive cost of the sensor suites necessary for localization. The most common sensor on these platforms, a three-dimensional (3D) light detection and ranging (LIDAR) scanner, generates dense point clouds with measures of surface reflectivity\u2014which other state-of-the-art localization methods have shown are capable of centimeter-level accuracy. Alternatively, we seek to obtain comparable localization accuracy with significantly cheaper, commodity cameras. We propose to localize a single monocular camera within a 3D prior ground-map, generated by a survey vehicle equipped with 3D LIDAR scanners. To do so, we exploit a graphics processing unit to generate several synthetic views of our belief environment. We then seek to maximize the normalized mutual information between our real camera measurements and these synthetic views. Results are shown for two different datasets, a 3.0 km and a 1.5 km trajectory, where we also compare against the state-of-the-art in LIDAR map-based localization.",

We present a place recognition algorithm which operates by matching local query image sequences to a database of image sequences. To match sequences, we calculate a matrix of low-resolution, contrast-enhanced image similarity probability values. The optimal sequence alignment, which can be viewed as a discontinuous path through the matrix, is found using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework reminiscent of Dynamic Time Warping from speech recognition. The state transitions enforce local velocity constraints and the most likely path sequence is recovered efficiently using the Viterbi algorithm. A rank reduction on the similarity probability matrix is used to provide additional robustness in challenging conditions when scoring sequence matches. We evaluate our approach on seven outdoor vision datasets and show improved precision-recall performance against the recently published seqSLAM algorithm.",

        "abstract": "The trajectory tracking of underactuated water surface robots (or boats, surface vessels, etc.) has been an attractive topic over the past decade, and a lot of controllers are proposed for this challenging problem. However, most of the existing trajectory tracking controllers of the underactuated water surface robots assume the global positions of the robots can be accurately measured. In the working environments of the robots, the global position measurements are sometimes unstable or even unavailable. To avoid the direct position measurement, a new controller is proposed in this paper for the trajectory tracking of underactuated water surface robots by adopting the monocular visual feedback. This controller works on the basis of a novel adaptive algorithm for estimating global position of the robot online using visual feature tracking from a monocular camera, and its orientation and velocity measured by the AHRS (Attitude and Heading Reference System) sensor and visual odometry. It is proved by Lyapunov theory that the proposed adaptive visual servo controller gives rise to the asymptotic trajectory tracking and convergence of the position estimation to the actual position. An experiment is conducted to validate the effectiveness and robust performance of the proposed controller.",

Previous studies on visualizing the acoustic environment viewed the level of sound pressures directly on the captured image, so the visualization was often based on a mixture of several sound sources. As a result, which targets to focus on was not intuitive. To help users selectively to find the targets and focus on the target analysis, we should extract the captured acoustic information and selectively propose it with the user demand. We have designed a three-layer visualization model for auditory awareness consisting of a sound source distribution layer, a sound location layer, and a sound saliency layer. The model extracts acoustic information by using the depth image and multi-directional sound sources captured with a depth sensor and microphone array. This model is used in the system we developed for visualizing auditory awareness.",

In this paper, we concentrate on the problem of identifying what kind of content is in a container based on tactile and/or visual feedback in combination with grasping. In particular, we investigate the benefits of using unimodal (visual or tactile) or bimodal (visual-tactile) sensory data for this purpose. We direct our study toward cardboard containers with liquid or solid content or being empty. The motivation for using grasping rather than shaking is that we want to investigate the content prior to applying manipulation actions to a container. Our results show that we achieve comparable classification rates with unimodal data and that the visual and tactile data are complimentary.",

        "abstract": "Soft continuum manipulators have the advantage of being more compliant and having more degrees of freedom than rigid redundant manipulators. This attribute should allow soft manipulators to autonomously execute highly dexterous tasks. However, current approaches to motion planning, inverse kinematics, and even design limit the capacity of soft manipulators to take full advantage of their inherent compliance. We provide a computational approach to whole arm planning for a soft planar manipulator that advances the arm's end effector pose in task space while simultaneously considering the arm's entire envelope in proximity to a confined environment. The algorithm solves a series of constrained optimization problems to determine locally optimal inverse kinematics. Due to inherent limitations in modeling the kinematics of a highly compliant soft robot and the local optimality of the planner's solutions, we also rely on the increased softness of our newly designed manipulator to accomplish the whole arm task, namely the arm's ability to harmlessly collide with the environment. We detail the design and fabrication of the new modular manipulator as well as the planner's central algorithm. We experimentally validate our approach by showing that the robotic system is capable of autonomously advancing the soft arm through a pipe-like environment in order to reach distinct goal states.",

        "abstract": "Low-cost navigation can be performed for aircraft using the integration of Inertial Navigation System (INS) information in conjunction with a regulatory information source, such as Global Position System (GPS). For situations where GPS is unavailable, it is desirable to have an alternative information source in order to regulate the known drifting phenomenon experienced by INS. In this paper, the use of wide-field optical flow is explored to regulate INS drift for the purpose of GPS-denied navigation. An Unscented Information Filter (UIF) algorithm for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) velocity and attitude estimation is proposed and evaluated with experimental flight data. The results demonstrate that the new filtering algorithm is capable of estimating the vehicle speed with approximately 1.4 m/s of error and regulating attitude errors to within 1.5 degrees standard deviation of error for both roll and pitch angles.",

This paper presents a workspace analysis of two recently proposed axis-symmetric parallel manipulators designed to overcome this problem. The studied manipulators are parametrized, their inverse kinematic models are derived and an in-depth singularity analysis is performed. Next, the architectural parameters are generated for one of the manipulators, using a meta-heuristic algorithm to produce the maximum singularity-free workspace. Thereafter, a second parameter calculation is performed to examine the relationship between maximizing the global conditioning index (GCI) and the resultant achievable workspace for the manipulators.",

Spatial cable differentials are constituted of several cables attaching the moving platform to the base but all of these cables are pulled by the same actuator through a differential system. To this aim, cable differentials with both planar and spatial architectures are first described in this work and then, their resultant properties on the force distribution is presented. Next, a special cable differential is selected and used to design the architecture of two incompletely and fully restrained robots. Finally, by comparing the workspaces of these robots with their classically actuated counterparts, the advantage of using differentials on their wrench-closure and wrench-feasible workspaces is illustrated.",

        "abstract": "Average consensus estimators enable robots in a communication network to calculate the mean of their local inputs in a distributed manner. Many distributed control methods for robot swarms rely on these estimators. The performance of such estimators depends on their design and the network topology. For mobile sensor networks, this topology may be unknown, making it difficult to design average consensus estimators for optimal performance. We introduce a design method for proportional-integral (PI) average consensus estimators that decouples estimator synthesis from network topology. This method also applies to the more general internal model (IM) estimator, yielding extended PI estimators that improve convergence rates without increasing communication costs. In simulations over many geometric random graphs, the extended PI estimator consistently reduces the estimation error settling time by a factor of five.",

This new framework is based on feature variables and a new concept referred to as expression graphs. It avoids some of the common pitfalls in previous frameworks, and provides a flexible and composable way to define robot control tasks. An architecture for a robot controller is proposed, as well as an implementation that can execute tasks described in the new specification language. Typical usage patterns for the new framework are explained on an example consisting of a kinematically redundant, bi-manual task on a PR2 robot. A comparison with existing frameworks shows the advantages of the new approach.",

When the error grows larger than a threshold or the optimal solution is requested, we use subgraph-preconditioned conjugate gradient method to solve the original problem where the subgraph preconditioner and initial estimate are provided by iSAM. Finally we use the optimal solution from SPCG to regularize iSAM in the next steps. The proposed method is consistent, efficient and can find the optimal solution.

During the field trials, the small fish with a length of 50mm has generated an equivalent average maximum velocity to real fish, measured in body lengths/ second (BL/s), greatly improving previous man-made systems, achieving a consistent free swimming speed of 10.4BL/s (0.52m/s) at 19Hz with a low energy consumption of 0.8 Watts.",

The design, safety, control and performance evaluation of the system are presented. A handle using an innovative cam mechanism enables natural hand opening/closing movements. The interaction force between the device and the subject is measured via four force sensors located on the handle of the device. A preliminary study with healthy subjects was performed to assess the performances of the device.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel sEMG decoder was proposed for estimating the human intention. When the position of the electrode changes, most of the decoder cannot be used as it is and needs to be retrained with new data from changed electrode positions. In retraining, old training results are often discarded and a new decoder is trained with only the data gathered after the changes. Naturally the decoding performance is hard to be maintained. Unlike these conventional decoders, the new decoder does not discard the old decoder and use it after a small modification to compensate the changes so that the decoding performance can be maintained after the changes. The core of this robustness is a newly proposed feature extractor named as class-augmented independent component analysis, which is composed of the ICA to extract independent components as new features and a scheme to reorder and match the new features with the old decoder features. Experiments confirm that the proposed method decodes human intentions from sEMG with a high accuracy and this performance can be maintained even the electrode position changes.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We learn to direct visual saliency in multimodal (i.e., pointing gestures and spoken references) human-robot interaction to highlight and segment arbitrary referent objects. For this purpose, we train a conditional random field to integrate features that reflect low-level visual saliency, the likelihood of salient objects, the probability that a given pixel is pointed at, and - if available - spoken information about the target object's visual appearance. As such, this work integrates several of our ideas and approaches, ranging from multi-scale spectral saliency detection, spatially debiased salient object detection, computational attention in human-robot interaction to learning robust color term models. We demonstrate that this machine learning driven integration outperforms the previously reported results on two datasets, one dataset without and one with spoken object references. In summary, for automatically detected pointing gestures and automatically extracted object references, our approach improves the rate at which the correct object is included in the initial focus of attention by 10.37% in the absence and 25.21% in the presence of spoken target object information.",
