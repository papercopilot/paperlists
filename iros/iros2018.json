        "abstract": "In this paper, we proposed a pheromone-based aggregation method based on the state-of-the-art BEECLUST algorithm. We investigated the impact of pheromone-based communication on the efficiency of robotic swarms to locate and aggregate at areas with a given cue. In particular, we evaluated the impact of the pheromone evaporation and diffusion on the time required for the swarm to aggregate. In a series of simulated and real-world evaluation trials, we demonstrated that augmenting the BEECLUST method with artificial pheromone resulted in faster aggregation times.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "For the success of visually-guided robotic errand service, it is critical to ensure dependability under various ill-conditioned visual environments. To this end, we have developed Adaptive Bayesian Recognition Framework in which in-situ selection of multiple sets of optimal features or evidences as well as proactive collection of sufficient evidences are proposed to implement the principle of dependability. The framework has shown excellent performance with a limited number of objects in a scene. However, there arises a need to extend the framework for handling a larger number of objects without performance degradation, while avoiding difficulty in feature engineering. To this end, a novel deep learning architecture, referred to here as FER-CNN, is introduced and integrated into the Adaptive Bayesian Recognition Framework. FER-CNN has capability of not only extracting but also reconstructing a hierarchy of features with the layer-wise independent feedback connections that can be trained. Reconstructed features representing parts of 3D objects then allow them to be semantically linked to ontology for exploring object categories and properties. Experiments are conducted in a home environment with real 3D daily-life objects as well as with the standard ModelNet dataset. In particular, it is shown that FER-CNN allows the number of objects and their categories to be extended by 10 and 5 times, respectively, while registering the recognition rate for ModelNet10 and ModelNet40 by 97% and 89.5%, respectively.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Robots have the potential to assist people in bed, such as in healthcare settings, yet bedding materials like sheets and blankets can make observation of the human body difficult for robots. A pressure-sensing mat on a bed can provide pressure images that are relatively insensitive to bedding materials. However, prior work on estimating human pose from pressure images has been restricted to 2D pose estimates and flat beds. In this work, we present two convolutional neural networks to estimate the 3D joint positions of a person in a configurable bed from a single pressure image. The first network directly outputs 3D joint positions, while the second outputs a kinematic model that includes estimated joint angles and limb lengths. We evaluated our networks on data from 17 human participants with two bed configurations: supine and seated. Our networks achieved a mean joint position error of 77 mm when tested with data from people outside the training set, outperforming several baselines. We also present a simple mechanical model that provides insight into ambiguity associated with limbs raised off of the pressure mat, and demonstrate that Monte Carlo dropout can be used to estimate pose confidence in these situations. Finally, we provide a demonstration in which a mobile manipulator uses our network's estimated kinematic model to reach a location on a person's body in spite of the person being seated in a bed and covered by a blanket.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Perceiving accurate 3D object shape is important for robots to interact with the physical world. Current research along this direction has been primarily relying on visual observations. Vision, however useful, has inherent limitations due to occlusions and the 2D-3D ambiguities, especially for perception with a monocular camera. In contrast, touch gets precise local shape information, though its efficiency for reconstructing the entire shape could be low. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that efficiently perceives accurate 3D object shape by incorporating visual and tactile observations, as well as prior knowledge of common object shapes learned from large-scale shape repositories. We use vision first, applying neural networks with learned shape priors to predict an object's 3D shape from a single-view color image. We then use tactile sensing to refine the shape; the robot actively touches the object regions where the visual prediction has high uncertainty. Our method efficiently builds the 3D shape of common objects from a color image and a small number of tactile explorations (around 10). Our setup is easy to apply and has potentials to help robots better perform grasping or manipulation tasks on real-world objects.",

        "abstract": "Automatic subsurface mapping is essential in the construction services, as it is anticipated to become the main operational environment of the future robots to be realized in the respective domain. Towards this direction, the paper at hand, introduces for the first time herein, an integrated framework for subsurface mapping by exploiting a surface operating mobile robot with a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR). The mobile robot tows the GPR antenna, which is mounted on a specifically designed trailer, and is utilized as the mean to cover the surface area, while at the same time the antenna scans the subsurface by emitting electromagnetic pulses. The gathered data are processed for the construction of a subsurface 3D map. Specifically, image processing techniques, that involve background segmentation, HOG [1] feature extraction, hypothesis verification and matching are applied on the 2D radargram (B-Scan) for the detection of the salient points that correspond to buried utilities. By employing the pulse propagation velocity into the subsurface and the soil utilities, the salient points are expressed in world coordinates and used for the composition of the 3D subsurface map. Our method has been evaluated on a real test site, accompanied by ground-truth annotation data of experts and revealed remarkable performance, exhibiting not only the feasibility of underground mapping but also the capacity to obtain exploitable results for underground robotic applications.",

        "abstract": "Flexure-based finger joints for prosthetic hands have been studied, but until now they lack stiffness and load bearing capacity. In this paper we present a design which combines large range of motion, stiffness and load bearing capacity, with an overload protection mechanism. Several planar and non-planar hinge topologies are studied to determine load capacity over the range of motion. Optimized topologies are compared, in 30 degrees deflected state, in terms of stresses by deflection and grasping forces. Additionally, support stiffnesses were computed for all hinges in the whole range of motion (45 degrees). The Hole Cross Hinge presented the best performance over the range of motion with a grasping force up to 15 N while deflected 30 degrees. A new concept, the Angle Three-Flexure Cross Hinge, provides outstanding performance for deflections from 17.5 up to 30 degrees with a 20 N maximum grasping force when fully deflected. Experimental verification of the support stiffness over the range of motion shows some additional compliances, but the stiffness trend of the printed hinge is in line with the model. The presented joints power grasping capability outperform current state flexure-base hands and are comparable to commercial non-flexure-based prosthetic hands. In the event of excessive loads, an overload protection mechanism is in place to protect the flexure- hinges.",

We introduce a 3D Convolutional Neural Network that takes a volumetric representation of an indoor scene as input and predicts 3D object bounding boxes, object categories, and orientations. Unlike prior state-of-the-arts, our approach does not depend on region proposal techniques to hypothesize object locations. We treat detection and recognition as one regression problem in a single network. Our elegant model is extremely fast and all predictions are reasoned from the global context of a point cloud in a continuous pipeline. We evaluate our approach on two standard datasets: the NYUv2 RGBD dataset and the SUN RGBD dataset. Experiments show that our approach is faster than start-of-the-art 3D detectors by several orders of magnitude towards real-time amodal 3D object detection.",

The proposed laparoscopic imaging system has three optic channels, two of which are responsible for stereo vision feedback and the other one is used for coded structured patterns projection. The projected patterns provide the robustness to homogeneous tissue surface since they add more features that can be relied on in the stereo matching. Image fiber bundles (100k pixels) and Gradient-index (GRIN) lenses are utilized to facilitate the remote image acquisition and miniaturization of the laparoscopic probe. Moreover, we adopt a digital micromirror device (DMD) and high-speed cameras to achieve fast pattern switching (up to 4 kHz) and high frame rate image acquisition. The system configuration allows for implementation of the time multiplexing pattern codification strategy in the 3D laparoscopic imaging system to enhance the reliability and resolution of the 3D surface reconstruction. A prototype is established, and various experiments are conducted. Comparative experimental results prove the advantages of our system design. The static and dynamic 3D reconstruction results validate the performance of the proposed 3D laparoscopic imaging system quantitatively and qualitatively.",

        "abstract": "Several modeling studies, which address neuromuscular control in impaired unperturbed gaits, were performed to predict human strategies to cope with lateral asymmetries in the body. Experimental studies show different step length and stance time relations between limbs in walking of stroke patients. By extension of a bipedal SLIP (spring-loaded inverted pendulum) based model and the corresponding controllers to 3D space, we focus on different features of the pathologic gaits. The introduced model is based on an extension of the FMCH (force modulated compliant hip) and VBLA (velocity based leg adjustment) model to 3D space. With the proposed model, asymmetric leg and control parameters can result in similar gait patterns as observed in experiments. These parameters comprise hip stiffness and rest angles in FMCH models and the tuning parameter of VBLA for foot placement. It is shown that asymmetries in muscle properties (e.g. stiffness) and leg adjustment can play an important role in generating pathologic gaits.",

        "abstract": "Till date, various seven-degrees-of-freedom (7-DOF)robot arms have been developed globally. In general, the robot arms utilized in factories are required to possess speed, power, and accuracy. They are isolated from humans using a fence to ensure human safety. However, a home robot should work near humans at an appropriate speed without a fence. One approach to meeting this requirement involves the installation of various sensors on the robot to control and stop the robot safely even if a collision has occurred. However, a robot system is complicated and expensive. In order to give inherent safety to the robot, we should lighten the robot arm. In this study, a 7-DOF lightweight arm with a wide wrist-motion range is introduced. The weight of movable parts is approximately 2.87 kg. To achieve such properties, we propose the use of three mechanisms: a shoulder mechanism with hollow cylinders, a wrist mechanism with a wide workspace, and an integrated wrist and elbow mechanisms of high power. To verify its feasibility, a prototype of the robot is designed and developed. The experimental results demonstrate its powerful performance and wide workspace of the wrist.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a 2D B-spline mapping framework for representing unstructured environments in a compact manner. While occupancy-grid and landmark-based maps have been successfully employed by the robotics community in indoor scenarios, outdoor long-term autonomous operations require a more compact representation of the environment. This work tackles this problem by interpolating the data of a high frequency sensor using B-spline curves. Compared to lines and circles, splines are more powerful in the sense that they allow for the description of more complex shapes in the scene. In this work, spline curves are continuously tracked and aligned across multiple sensor readings using lightweight methods, making the proposed framework suitable for robot navigation in outdoor missions. In particular, a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm specifically tailored for B-spline maps is presented here. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated by Software-in-the-Loop (SiL) simulations in different scenarios.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a framework for engaging a target while approaching it from a long distance, using observation from sensors on-board a mobile robot. The proposed framework consists of two multi-stage Bayesian approaches to reliably detect and accurately engage with the target under uncertainties. The multi-stage localization approach localizes the robot and the target in a global coordinate frame. Their locations are estimated sequentially when the robot is at a long distance from the target, whereas they are localized simultaneously when the target is in the close vicinity. In the multi-stage target observation approach, a level of confidence and the associated probability of detection of the sensor are defined to make the target detectable in maximal occasions. This allows the extended Kalman filter to be implemented for the target engagement. The proposed framework was implemented on an unmanned ground vehicle equipped with multiple sensors. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework in solving real-world problems.",

This requires the network to be time invariant and differentiable; neural networks with dynamics are thus generally outside the scope of these methods. Biological neural circuits are highly dynamic yet clearly able to support learning. We propose a reinforcement learning approach inspired by the mechanisms and dynamics of biological synapses. The network weights undergo spontaneous fluctuations, and a reward signal modulates the centre and amplitude of fluctuations to converge to a desired network behaviour. We test the new learning rule on a 2D bipedal walking simulation, using a control system that combines a recurrent neural network, a bio-inspired central pattern generator layer and proportional-integral control, and demonstrate the first successful solution to this benchmark task.",

In this work, we present a soft robot for pipeline inspection, which consists of an earthworm-like soft robot and a Central Pattern Generator (CPG)-based control system.

        "abstract": "With a light and slender body, a cable-driven redundant spatial manipulator (CRSM) has flexible manipulability and high maneuverability in confined environment. However, compared with revolute rigid manipulators, such type of manipulators generally has low stiffness and weak load capacity. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism design to improve the stiffness and load capacity without sacrificing the manipulator dexterity and the end-effector accuracy. The manipulator is composed of 3 active-passive-linkage segments and 1 active tool end-effector. Each active-passive segment has 2 degrees of freedom (DOFs) driven by three evenly distributed cables. Pretension mechanism and linkage cables are designed to keep strict equal angles of adjacent joints. A separable control box, which contains all the motors and cable transmission mechanisms is also designed with a quick release-and-lock mechanism. Therefore, the robotic arm can be easily removed and installed. Based on the equal angle characteristic, kinematic equations of manipulator are established with Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) method and the Jacobian matrix is also simplified. Further analysis of the workspace supplies the guidance for the task design and motion planning. Finally, a prototype system is developed to perform the stiffness and load capacity experiments. Experimental results show that the developed CRSM has relatively high stiffness and load capacity.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system for humanoid robots. We introduce a new binary descriptor called DLab that exploits the combined information of color, depth, and intensity to achieve robustness with respect to uniqueness, reproducibility, and stability. We use DLab within ORB-SLAM, where we replaced the place recognition module with a modification of FAB-MAP that works with newly built codebooks using our binary descriptor. In experiments carried out in simulation and with a real Nao humanoid equipped with an RGB-D camera, we show that DLab has a superior performance in comparison to other descriptors. The application to feature tracking and place recognition reveal that the new descriptor is able to reliably track features even in sequences with seriously blurred images and that it has a higher percentage of correctly identified similar images. As a result, our new visual SLAM system has a lower absolute trajectory error in comparison to ORB-SLAM and is able to accurately track the robot's trajectory.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study a compact wheeled robot that can jump while rolling. Some robots are capable of jumping or rolling, but as far as we know, those robots are not focused on jumping while rolling. We know that animals jump while running to escape from predators. Robots can move quickly by jumping while rolling. We consider a model of a robot jumping while rolling and evaluate the proposed robot. The proposed robot has two wheels and a jumping mechanism based on snap-through buckling of an elastic strip. The proposed robot can jump about 5.9 cm high and 22 cm wide on average while maintaining a traveling speed of about 1.2 m/s. The proposed robot can change the jumping angle without greatly decreasing the impulse for the moving speed.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the effects of contact models on contact-implicit trajectory optimization for manipulation. We consider three different approaches: (1)a contact model that is based on complementarity constraints, (2)a smooth contact model, and our proposed method (3) a variable smooth contact model. We compare these models in simulation in terms of physical accuracy, quality of motions, and computation time. In each case, the optimization process is initialized by setting all torque variables to zero, namely, without a meaningful initial guess. For simulations, we consider a pushing task with varying complexity for a 7 degrees-of-freedom robot arm. Our results demonstrate that the optimization based on the proposed variable smooth contact model provides a good trade-off between the physical fidelity and quality of motions at the cost of increased computation time.",

Based on a detailed dynamic model simulation, we analyse and elect the best nonlinear algorithm among those presented in the state-of-the-art literature addressing local derivative-free nonlinear Kalman Filters (KFs): the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), the Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) and the Transformed Unscented Kalman Filter (TUKF). Here, these three nonlinear probabilistic estimators were compared in terms of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the average execution time over Monte Carlo simulations. We simulated real-world conditions for our in-production HUAUV prototype using Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data and state augmentation for sensor data filtering and trajectory estimation. We have concluded that the CKF proved to be the most interesting KF to low-cost on-board applications for high dimensional state spaces.",

In this work, supervised and shared controllers have been developed in a vision-free, human-in-the-Ioop, control framework to help surgeon during a surgical suturing procedure. Experiments conducted on the da Vinci Research Kit robot proves the effectiveness of the method indicating also the guidelines for improving results.",

However, full automation of RAS in complex surgical environments is still not feasible and collaboration with the surgeon is required for safe and effective use. In this work, we utilize our Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR) to develop and evaluate a shared control strategy for the collaboration of the robot with a human operator in surgical scenarios. We consider 2D pattern cutting tasks with partial blood occlusion of the cutting pattern using a robotic electrocautery tool. For this surgical task and RAS system, we i) develop a confidence-based shared control strategy, ii) assess the pattern tracking performances of manual and autonomous controls and identify the confidence models for human and robot as well as a confidence-based control allocation function, and iii) experimentally evaluate the accuracy of our proposed shared control strategy. In our experiments on porcine fat samples, by combining the best elements of autonomous robot controller with complementary skills of a human operator, our proposed control strategy improved the cutting accuracy by 6.4%, while reducing the operator work time to 44% compared to a pure manual control.",

This paper proposes an architecture composed of three nested control loops. The outer loop exploits a robot kinematic model to plan the footstep positions. In the mid layer, a predictive controller generates a Center of Mass trajectory according to the well-known table-cart model. Through a whole-body inverse kinematics algorithm, we can define joint references for position controlled walking. The outcomes of these two loops are then interpreted as inputs of a stack-of-task QP-based torque controller, which represents the inner loop of the presented control architecture. This resulting architecture allows the robot to walk also in torque control, guaranteeing higher level of compliance. Real world experiments have been carried on the humanoid robot iCub.",

Based on these ideas, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) algorithm was able to provide impressive results in continuous state and action domains, which are closely linked to most of the robotics-related tasks. In this paper, a vision-based autonomous multirotor landing maneuver on top of a moving platform is presented. The behaviour has been completely learned in simulation without prior human knowledge and by means of deep reinforcement learning techniques. Since the multirotor is controlled in attitude, no high level state estimation is required. The complete behaviour has been trained with continuous action and state spaces, and has provided proper results (landing at a maximum velocity of 2 m/s), Furthermore, it has been validated in a wide variety of conditions, for both simulated and real-flight scenarios, using a low-cost, lightweight and out-of-the-box consumer multirotor.",

        "abstract": "Marine growths that flourish on the surfaces of underwater structures, such as bridge pylons, make the inspection and maintenance of these structures challenging. A robotic solution, using an Intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (I-AUV), is developed for removing marine growth. This paper presents a Deformable Spiral Coverage Path Planning (DSCPP) algorithm for marine growth removal. DSCPP generates smooth paths to prevent damage to the surfaces of the structures and to avoid frequent or aggressive decelerations and accelerations due to sharp turns. DSCPP generates a spiral path within a circle and analytically maps the path to a minimum bounding rectangle which encompasses an area of a surface with marine growth. It aims to achieve a spiral path with minimal length while preventing missed areas of coverage. Several case studies are presented to validate the algorithm. Comparison results show that DSCPP outperforms the popular boustrophedon-based coverage approach when considering the requirements for the application under consideration.",

        "abstract": "This study presents a differential elastic joint for use in multi-linked pipeline inspection robots. Active joints to stretch against the pipe wall are essential for adapting robots to use in vertical pipes and slippery inner surfaces where a large traction force is required. Series elastic actuators with a high reduction system have typically been used to sense force/torque in such applications. However, compactness, power, and bi-directional series elasticity are required to conduct in-pipe inspections. In this study, we propose an active joint using a differential elastic actuator with a rubber spring for decreasing the size and increasing the stiffness of the joint. After describing the configuration of the differential elastic actuator that is suitable for our robot and the design theory of the rubber spring cross-section, we conducted experiments to verify its torque property.",

        "abstract": "In this work we consider a swarm of agents shaped as bars with a certain orientation in the state space. Members of the swarm have to reach an aggregate state, while guaranteeing the collision avoidance and possibly achieving an angular consensus. By relying on a segment-to-segment distance definition, we propose a control law, which guides the agents towards this goal. A theoretical analysis of the proposed control scheme along with simulations and experimental results is provided. The proposed framework can be used to model several application scenarios ranging from collaborative transportation to precision farming, where each agent may represent either a large robot or a group of robots intent to carry bar-like shaped loads. Representative examples include: a fleet of robot-teams performing a collaborative object transportation task in an automated logistic setting, or a fleet of autonomous tractors each carrying a large atomizer to spray chemical products for pest and disease control in a precision farming setting.",

The main contribution of the work is a realization of said control scheme that grants a less abrupt and safer robot response in case of system failures, that would cause the local joint torque controllers to lose their torque reference inputs. In particular, we propose a semi-centralized impedance control implementation which eliminates the instability of the pure joint torque control schemes used in the classical fully centralized methods when torque reference interruptions occur. Finally, we present experimental results, proving the effectiveness of our method and demonstrating how it ensures a safer behaviour compared to a fully centralized impedance control implementation when the communication to the ankle joints is interrupted. This paper is a follow-up work of [1], which presented and analyzed the parallel kinematics ankles.",

We generalize the well-known iLQR algorithm to different multiple shooting variants, combining advantages like straightforward initialization and a closed-loop forward integration. All algorithms have similar computational complexity, i.e. linear complexity in the time horizon, and can be derived in the same computational framework. We compare the full-step variants of our algorithms and present several simulation examples, including a high-dimensional underactuated robot subject to contact switches. Simulation results show that our multiple shooting algorithms can achieve faster convergence, better local contraction rates and much shorter runtimes than classical iLQR, which makes them a superior choice for nonlinear model predictive control applications.",

Two robotic legs incorporating CKC mechanisms are utilized as case studies, and simulations of each leg performing a dynamic monopedal gait are illustrated.",

The example grasps are taught by human demonstration and mapped to similar objects by a non-rigid transformation. The mapped grasps are evaluated analytically and refined by an orientation search to improve the grasp robustness and robot reachability. The proposed approach is able to plan high-quality grasps, avoid collision, satisfy task requirements, and achieve efficient online planning.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a programming by demonstration framework for teaching impedance modulation using human demonstrations. Physiologically, human stiffness and damping are coupled at the muscle level, restricting the ability to modulate impedance according to task demands. Robotic systems often do not have this restriction (stiffness and damping can be varied independently), but the challenge is to devise an appropriate variable impedance profile for a given task. In this paper, the task critical component is first learned for imitation and a robot-specific controller is then blended into the control using the null space. In doing so, the control cheme takes advantage of both human and robot `best practice'. Experimental results on a physical robot suggest an order of magnitude better mean performance, with lower variance, can be achieved using the blended scheme.",

        "abstract": "Suction is an effective method for picking various objects because it makes trajectory planning and control easy. However, suction has not been used due to misalignment and leakage of suction air when handling a variety of shapes. We therefore develop a hand to handle these characteristics. First, we model the vacuum pump and pad characteristics to allow evaluation of momentum and suction force in the case of leakage. Utilizing this, we select a configuration suitable for the items in the Amazon Robotics Challenge 2017. In addition, we design a mechanism for switching from suction to pinching for grasping items that cannot be sucked. Moreover, robust pinching is made possible by equipping the fingertips with a passive linear motion mechanism. In the Amazon Robotics Challenge 2017, it was shown possible to stably grasp items with irregularities and items with large moments. Furthermore, items that cannot be grasped by suction can also be grasped robustly by switching to the pinching mechanism.",

For this adaptation, robot motions should be implemented as combination of primitive motions which are based on sensor reaction. Among various sensing methods, non contact sensing is required as a means of preventing operation failures such as pushing objects. Especially, proximity sensors have been proved effective in avoiding occlusion problems. In this paper, we first develop a gripper on which proximity sensors are mounted all around, and then calculate distance between the gripper and objects using proposed calibration method. This enables robots to recognize detailed shapes of objects surrounding the gripper. We also propose primitive motions for object search and grasp, and describe the contents of each motion. The motions are based on sensor information obtained from the gripper. We verify the effectiveness of our system through an experiment in which a real robot performs complex tasks by combination of the primitive motions.",

        "abstract": "For traditional manipulators, there is a large number of electrical cables between the motion controller and the joint servo controllers. It is very inconvenient for maintenance, update, and safe operation. In this paper, we develop a lightweight redundant manipulator with high stable wireless communication link and compliance control. The motion controller, servo controller, and communication link are taken as a whole system to be optimized. The manipulator body and the motion controller are physically separated. It is very helpful for building distributed networked-manufacturing system or intelligent manufacturing system for Industry 4.0. The control system can be quickly updated by changing the object's identification without reconnect the communication cables. The mechanical part of the manipulator contains modular joints and links. Each joint is integrated with hall sensors, an incremental magnetic encoder, an absolute magnetic encoder and current sensors. The electrical part includes a central controller, seven joint servo controllers, and a wireless communication module based on ZigBee. By designing the application layer protocol, the communication stability is improved. In order to achieve the force control requirements in fine operation like assembly. A wireless compliance control frame is then designed. The compliance control method is realized on the central controller, by which the generated control commands are sent to the joint servo controllers through a wireless link. The problems caused by large electrical cables are then solved. Finally, the prototype and the experimental system are developed. Some experiments are carried out, including wireless communication test, trajectory tracking experiments, load carrying experiments, and wireless impedance control experiments. Results verify the functions and performance of the developed 7-DOF manipulator.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Collaborative robots are often designed with limited power and force capacity, with the aim to provide affordable solutions and ensure human safety in case of accidental collisions and impacts. If a task requires a power beyond this capacity, or is performed repeatedly over long periods, such limits may be exceeded, which can cause inevitable robot damage and contribute to the lost productivity. In such cases, where hardware solutions and improvements are not applicable, effective software frameworks can prolong robot productivity and lifetime. To this end, in this paper we propose a novel technique for the monitoring and management of robot fatigue in repetitive or high-effort task execution scenarios. The robot fatigue is estimated by the measured temperature of motors in the joints. The proposed fatigue management system is composed of two-stage reaction process that is triggered by different levels of the estimated fatigue. The first stage exploits the kinematic redundancy of robot structure in attempt to minimise the load in the specific joints that under fatigue by reconfiguration in the joint space through the null space of the Cartesian task production. If the first stage is not successful in reducing the fatigue, the second stage is activated that gradually reduces the forces of hybrid controller. At that point, the human co-worker can temporarily take over the task execution until the robot will be recovered from the excessive fatigue. To validate the proposed approach we conducted experiments on KUKA Lightweight Robot performing two interaction tasks: autonomous surface wiping and collaborative human-robot surface polishing.",

Our contribution presented in this paper is a mobility model for swarms of UAVs based on the Artificial Potential Fields (APF) principle. In our model, the involved UAVs collaborate by sharing data about the obstacles that they detected. By doing so, a UAV which is not close enough to an obstacle to detect it thanks to its own sensors will still have the proper data to take this obstacle into account in its path planning. To validate our mobility strategies with realistic constraints we simulate the performances of existing sensors and transmitters, and consider real-world environment.",

The controller is formulated accordingly in order to allow the system to operate in a constrained workspace with static obstacles. The goal of the proposed scheme is to guide the robot's end-effector towards the optimal grasping regions with guaranteed input and state constraints such as occlusion and obstacle avoidance, workspace boundaries and field of view constraints.

Images from the camera are processed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)to extract a ground plane edge image. Pixels that belong to these edges are used in the observation equation of the EKF to estimate the camera location. Use of the CNN makes it possible to extract ground plane edges under significant changes to scene illumination. The EKF framework lends itself to use of a suitable motion model, fusing information from any other sensors such as wheel encoders or inertial measurement units, if available, and rejecting spurious observations. A series of experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.",

Specifically, this work addresses the marsupial-based subset of multi-robot teams, where \u201ccarrier\u201d robots transport and deploy \u201cpassenger\u201d robots. The approach starts with a high-level watershed segmentation of the world to determine the free-space regions accessible by each robot in the team. Topological graph planning then decides the high-level motion plan for each robot between these free-space regions. Finally, a low-level path planner generates optimized, dynamically-feasible trajectories for each robot along the topological path. The performance of the approach is evaluated in simulation and through hardware experiments.",

        "abstract": "Robust localization is a prerequisite for autonomous vehicles. Traditional visual localization methods like visual odometry suffer error accumulation on long range navigation. In this paper, a flexible road map based probabilistic filtering method is proposed to tackle this problem. To effectively match the ego-trajectory to various curving roads in map, a new representation based on anchor point (AP) which captures the main curving points on the trajectory is presented. Based on APs of the map and trajectory, a flexible Multi-Position Joint Particle Filtering (MPJPF) framework is proposed to correct the position error. The method features the capability of adaptively estimating a series of APs jointly and only updates the estimation at situations with low uncertainty. It explicitly avoids the drawbacks of obliging to determine the current position at large uncertain situations such as dense parallel road branches. The experiments carried out on KITTI benchmark demonstrate our success.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Minimally invasive surgery can benefit greatly from utilizing micro-agents. These miniaturized agents need to be clearly visualized and precisely controlled to ensure the success of the surgery. Since medical imaging modalities suffer from low acquisition rate, multi-rate sampling methods can be used to estimate the intersample states of micro-agents. Hence, the sampling rate of the controller can be virtually increased even if the position data is acquired using a slow medical imaging modality. This study presents multi-rate Luenberger and Kalman state estimators for visual tracking of micro-agents. The micro-agents are tracked using sum of squared differences and normalized cross correlation based visual tracking. Further, the outputs of the two methods are merged to minimize the tracking error and prevent tracking failures. During the experiments, the micro-agents with different geometrical shapes and sizes are imaged using a 2D ultrasound machine and a microscope, and manipulated using electromagnetic coils. The multi-rate state estimation accuracy is measured using a high speed camera. The precision of the tracking and multi-rate state estimation are verified experimentally under challenging conditions. For this purpose, an elliptical shaped magnetic micro-agent with a length of 48 pixels is used. Maximum absolute error in x and y axes are 2.273 and 2.432 pixels for an 8-fold increase of the sample rate (25 frames per second), respectively. During the experiments, it was observed that the micro-agents could be tracked more reliably using normalized cross correlation based visual tracking and inters ample states could be estimated more accurately using Kalman state estimator. Experimental results show that the proposed method could be used to track micro-agents in medical imaging modalities and estimate system states at intermediate time instants in real-time.",

It integrates, in a unified framework, the treatment of multiple tasks, multiple kinematic chains, different joint priorities and hard constraints. The management of multiple tasks is based on the reverse priority method, that has been modified so that it makes possible the assignment of different priorities to each joint in order to accomplish the tasks. This framework is also suitable for robotic systems with multiple kinematic chains, which could share several joints. Moreover, it can deal with bilateral and unilateral constraints, that can be defined either at joint or cartesian space. Hard constraints are considered at each priority level, instead of treating them separately at the highest priority level. The proposed framework has been evaluated in simulation and in real experiments with a redundant underwater vehicle-manipulator system at sea.",

        "abstract": "Existing adaptive robot control laws typically require an engineering choice of a constant adaptation gain matrix, which often involves repeated and time-consuming trial and error. Moreover, physical consistency of the estimated inertial parameters or the uniform positive definiteness of the estimated robot mass matrix cannot in general be guaranteed without nonsmooth corrections, e.g., projection to the boundary of the feasible parameter set. In this paper we present a natural adaptive control law that mitigates many of these difficulties, by exploiting the coordinate-invariant differential geometric structure of the space of physically consistent inertial parameters. Our approach provides a more generalizable and physically consistent adaptation law for the robot parameters without significant additional computations compared to existing methods. Simulation results showing markedly improved tracking error convergence over existing adaptive control laws are provided as validation.",

        "abstract": "Crossmodal conflict resolution is crucial for robot sensorimotor coupling through the interaction with the environment, yielding swift and robust behaviour also in noisy conditions. In this paper, we propose a neurorobotic experiment in which an iCub robot exhibits human-like responses in a complex crossmodal environment. To better understand how humans deal with multisensory conflicts, we conducted a behavioural study exposing 33 subjects to congruent and incongruent dynamic audio-visual cues. In contrast to previous studies using simplified stimuli, we designed a scenario with four animated avatars and observed that the magnitude and extension of the visual bias are related to the semantics embedded in the scene, i.e., visual cues that are congruent with environmental statistics (moving lips and vocalization) induce the strongest bias. We implement a deep learning model that processes stereophonic sound, facial features, and body motion to trigger a discrete behavioural response. After training the model, we exposed the iCub to the same experimental conditions as the human subjects, showing that the robot can replicate similar responses in real time. Our interdisciplinary work provides important insights into how crossmodal conflict resolution can be modelled in robots and introduces future research directions for the efficient combination of sensory observations with internally generated knowledge and expectations.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new characterization of mobility for formations of unicycle robots defined by distance-bearing constraints. In fact, by introducing a simple reduction procedure which associates a prescribed formation with a \u201cmacro-robot\u201d, we extend the classification by type proposed by Campion et al., to multi-agent systems. To simplify the classification task, which only leverages the nonslip condition for a conventional centered wheel, we assume that the robots are disposed at the vertices of a regular convex polygon. We demonstrate the practical utility of the notion of macro-robot in a trajectory-tracking control problem for a formation of unicycles.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel manufacturing process for creating monolithic, multi-chambered inflatable structures including both soft and rigid components. Specifically, our process involves stacking layers of textiles or plastics and thermal adhesive film, then bonding the structure with a heat press or in an oven. Several different ways of arranging textiles and thermal adhesive film in order to achieve airtight structures are presented. Since this process only uses materials that bend, but do not stretch, it permits the easy inclusion of rigid structures such as circuit boards, plates that constrain inflatable chambers to bend in specified locations, and rigid pieces that enable sections of a robot to be connected in a modular fashion. Additionally, the process permits folding layers before their assembly, leading to more complex geometries. We present three different possible seam types, and enumerate the different types of corners that can be constructed without leaking. We present measurements of the ability of these structures to support pressure and measurements of the strength of bonds between textiles and other materials. Finally, we present two examples of robots constructed using this manufacturing method, including a hybrid soft/rigid robotic arm and a soft robot that can roll along the ground.",

        "abstract": "Efforts to engineer insect-sized (~100 mg) robots are motivated by their potential advantages relative to larger robots, such as greater deployment numbers at the same cost. Previous iterations have demonstrated controlled flight, but were limited in terms of locomotion capabilities outside of flight. They also consisted of many parts, making them difficult to fabricate. Here we present a re-design that lowers the center of mass, allowing the robot to additionally land without the need for long legs. Furthermore, we show that the new design allows for wing-driven ground locomotion. This is achieved by varying the speed of downstroke relative to the upstroke of the flapping wings, which also allows for steering. By landing and subsequently moving along the ground, the robot can negotiate extremely confined spaces and underneath obstacles, as well as navigate to precise locations for sensing operations. The new design also drastically reduces the number of parts, simplifying fabrication. We describe the new design in detail and present results demonstrating these capabilities, as well as feedback-stabilized flights.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A sensing glove is an attractive application of wearable devices. Soft sensors are emerging to replace rigid sensing units, especially for wearable sensor systems, due to its inherent softness, flexibility, and stretchability. However, the fabrication process for the soft sensors is usually complex, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and has low production rate. To integrate a sensor system, an assembly process is essential, which may make the system bulky. Moreover, a solution for the electrode parts has rarely been suggested, although a bulky electrode part may obstruct the user's movement and degrade performance of the sensor. Thus, in this study, a novel fabrication process is suggested based on direct ink writing (DIW) of eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn), which forms all the items in the sensor system from the sensing units, wiring, and the electrode part. A sensing glove for 2D finger motions was fabricated, and its performance was verified in terms of linearity, dynamic response, and accuracy. The sensing glove can be used as an easily-wearable and an intuitive interface to the virtual reality environment.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel agricultural robot for greenhouse applications. In many greenhouses, including the greenhouse used in this work, sets of pipes run along the floor between plant rows. These pipes are components of the greenhouse heating system, and doubles as rails for trolleys used by workers. A flat surface separates the start of each rail set at the greenhouse headland. If a robot is to autonomously drive along plant rows, and also be able to move from one set of rails to the next, it must be able to locomote both on rails and on flat surfaces. This puts requirements on mechanical design and navigation, as the robot must cope with two very different operational environments. The robot presented in this paper has been designed to overcome these challenges and allows for autonomous operation both in open environments and on rails by using only low-cost sensors. The robot is assembled using a modular system created by the authors and tested in a greenhouse during ordinary operation. Using the robot, we map the environment and automatically determine the starting point of each rail in the map. We also show how we are able to identify rails and estimate the robots pose relative to theses using only a low-cost 3D camera. When a rail is located, the robot makes the transition from floor to rail and travels along the row of plants before it moves to the next rail set which it has identified in the map. The robot is used for UV treatment of cucumber plants.",

        "abstract": "Many surgical robots are remotely actuated by means of wire cables. In the past, the cables wound around circular pulleys at the robot joints did not constitute a problem of the cable driver structure. However, the pulleys inside the joints are removed recently in order to miniaturize the joints, so a specially designed cable driver suitable for the miniature joint structure is required for stable driving. In this paper, we propose a novel cable driver design for driving a pulleyless rolling joint and extend it to 2-DOF structure. Then, the proposed cable driver is manufactured using 3D printing with the 2-DOF bending joint, and an experiment is performed to evaluate them using the prototype. The cable driver proposed in this paper can drive pulleyless rolling joints stably with low cable tension. In addition, it can decouple yaw and pitch motion of the joints completely, therefore it can be applied to a variety of thin robots and instruments including steerable endoscopes and surgical robots.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this study, we propose an extended coaxial spherical joint module (E-CoSMo) with three to four degrees of freedom (DOFs) for a multi-DOF robot platform. The E-CoSMo consists of a coaxial spherical parallel mechanism (CSPM) with three DOFs and one extended DOF based on a universal joint mechanism (UJM) coaxially connected to the CSPM. This structure enables the application of serial link configuration (such as shoulder-elbow) with wide and universal ROMs while allowing all four actuators to be placed in the base. This makes the inertia of the moving link part to be dramatically reduced and thus contributes to decreasing the mechanical impedance of the multi-DOF robot system. In addition, through the effective design of the coaxial spherical joint module, the output rotational torque in a specific axial direction reaches approximately three times then the torque of a single actuator. To optimally implement this, we applied an optimal design approach that considers the mechanical performance and design constraints. The mechanical impedance reduction effect through the proposed module is discussed. The feasibility of the E-CoSMo is also verified through a dynamic simulation. Finally, the proposed mechanism is verified using a fabricated prototype.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new application of atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) aiming for fabricating a microfluidic system on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surface. While PDMS is widely used for microfluidic chips, the fabrication of a chip requires different instruments which are not easily accessible for small-scale companies or laboratories. Therefore, we are motivated to develop a simple and low-cost method for such a fluidic system fabrication. The idea of this work is to directly pattern a fluidic channel on a PDMS surface with a plasma jet, which is known for its capability of modifying the hydrophobicity on a surface. The feasibility test first showed that fluid only flows in plasma-treated regions as having physical walls. The plasma parameters were then optimized using Taguchi method based on experiments. The optimization significantly reduce the required plasma treating time from more than 30 treating rounds to only 3 treating rounds, over ten times improved. Methods for further improving the resolution to micrometer-scale have been discussed. In addition to the advantages of fast and low-cost of the proposed method, making microfluidic channels on the surfaces of PDMS chip is also convenient for recollecting cultured cells on a chip in the field of regenerative medicine.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel input device for a robotic prosthetic hand based on capacitance change. The proposed device can sense the deformation of the skin due to the activity of the muscle by measuring the capacitance change between the skin and the electrode. Therefore, it can be used as a sensor for estimating a user's intention through medical electrodiagnostic techniques such as electromyogram (EMG)and force myography (FMG). The proposed device can acquire data in a non-invasive way and is advantageous with easier data processing than that for an EMG signal. Moreover, it is resistant to the impedance change of skin because the capacitance is measured in a non-contact manner, unlike the existing methods which work with direct contact with the skin such as EMG. Additionally, unlike FMG, the device is lightly attached to the skin without being strongly fixed with velcro, which offsets problems that occur while re-wearing the device. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed idea, three of the newly developed input devices were used to classify four hand movements (fist, scissors, paper, and rest)using a multilayer perceptron (MLP). As a result, the classification success rates for the fist, paper, scissor, and rest motions were obtained as 99.3%, 98.3%, 98.4%, and 99.1%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a novel method for estimating online the torques at the ankle, knee and hip of a user with the goal of generating reference signals for torque controlled lower limb exoskeletons. In particular, this approach attempts to address difficulties arising in real life scenarios when noncyclic locomotion activity, unexpected terrain or unpredicted interactions with the surroundings occur. An advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require any information on the user's upper body (i.e. pose, weight and center of mass location)or on any interaction of the user's upper body with the environment (i.e. payload handling or pushing and pulling task). By monitoring the interaction of the user's feet with the ground through a novel sensorized shoe sensing system, the method applies an inverse static analysis on the user's lower limbs to estimate in real time the torque at each leg joint. The system is fully wearable, ergonomic and portable and uses a reduced number of body posture sensors. The design of the sensorized shoes permits plantar flexion, while measuring the toe and heel orientation and the interaction loads. This allows walking on irregular terrains and natural feet postures in different tasks. Trials were performed to validate the proposed approach under different tasks and terrains. Finally, the knee torques estimated online by the proposed strategy were used as reference signals to drive the iT-Knee Bipedal System in an assistive task.",

To this end, we establish a perspective model and develop a novel Pan/Tilt monocular-based navigation scheme. Simultaneously, the following three key issues are addressed. First, to locate the effective landmark - transmission tower timely and reliably, we customize a neural network for tower detection and combine it with a fast and smooth tracking. Second, to provide UAV with a robust and precise heading, we detect the transmission lines and compute and optimize their vanishing point. Third, to keep a safe distance from transmission lines, we optimize a homography matrix to restore the parallel nature of transmission lines and perceive the distance variation by a point set registration model. Finally, by the designed UAV platform, we test the whole system in a real-world transmission-line inspection scenario under different weather condition and achieve an encouraging result. Our approach provides great flexibility for refined inspection and effectively improves inspection safety.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous elevator operation is considered an intelligent solution in handling the inter-floor navigation problem of service robots. As one of the most fundamental steps, elevator button recognition starts to receive more and more attention. However, due to the challenging image conditions and severe class imbalance problem, the performance of existing results is unsatisfying. In this paper, we propose to combine an optical character recognition (OCR) network and the Faster RCNN architecture into a single neural network, called OCR-RCNN to facilitate an end-to-end training and elevator button recognition procedure. To verify our method, we collect a large dataset of elevator panels and carry out extensive comparative experiments. The experiment results show that our method can greatly outperform the traditional recognition pipelines, yielding an accurate and robust performance on recognizing untrained elevator buttons.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the design of a soft elbow exosuit capable of providing supplemental lifting assistance by reducing muscle activity of the bicep muscle. The aim is to improve the efficiency and endurance of workers who are tasked with repetitive lifting. The design consists of an array of pneumatically pressurized soft actuators, which are encased in nylon fabric that allows for a high force-to-weight ratio of 211.SN/g. An analytical model governing the bending behavior of two consecutive actuators and torque generated by the exosuit is developed, with test results showing less than 10% error from the theoretical model. An elbow joint torque value of 27.6N.m is achieved at 300kPa, which is comparable to the 30N.m maximum set by OSHA requirements in the USA. Further testing with a healthy participant is performed using surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors and a motion capture system to assess the capabilities of the exosuit to provide active assistance to the bicep during isometric and concentric contractions. Measurable assistance to lifting is observed with minimal obstruction to the user's range of motion for all experiments.",

The mechanism attaches to the bone of the patient, providing a stable and robust platform for the laser integrated in the endoscope tip which has to be moved precisely in the sub-millimeter range along a preoperatively planned path. This method is only possible because cutting bone with laser instead of using conventional bone drills and saws involves considerably lower interaction forces. The design, kinematics, control, and motion performance of the concept are presented for an upscaled prototype. The obtained deviation of the endoscope tip motion from the reference path lies in the sub-millimeter range. This result allows us to conclude that the concept is more than promising. Furthermore, we expect that the herein presented principle will influence the way osteotomies will be performed in the future.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper we demonstrate a universal jamming gripper with a partially filled membrane that can pick up submerged objects resting on soft substrates. Jamming grippers take advantage of the phenomenon of particle jamming to control the compliance of an end effector membrane. Changes in internal membrane pressure are used to transition the membrane between hard and soft states. The effort was motivated by the need for tools to sample artifacts on deep sea shipwrecks, which are often found resting on waterlogged timbers, or partially buried in fine, loose sediment. Limiting downward force protects the target, and reduces the likelihood that it will be pushed down in to the substrate, which could lead to a failed grasp. In benchtop tests, the downward force, and the ratio of maximum lifting force to downward force, are shown to be strongly dependent on the initial volume of particles and fluid in the gripper membrane. The gripper achieves lifting forces 6.7 times the downward force on targets with high aspect ratios. Experiments in a fresh water tank demonstrate the ability to grasp objects resting on soft sediment, and compliant foam. Finally, experiments at sea demonstrate that the end effector functions at depths of more than 1000m seawater, successfully grasping a range of irregular objects.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Although there has been recent progress in control of multi-joint prosthetic legs for periodic tasks such as walking, volitional control of these systems for non-periodic maneuvers is still an open problem. In this paper, we develop a new controller that is capable of both periodic walking and common volitional leg motions based on a piecewise holonomic phase variable through a finite state machine. The phase variable is constructed by measuring the thigh angle, and the transitions in the finite state machine are formulated through sensing foot contact together with attributes of a nominal reference gait trajectory. The controller was implemented on a powered knee-ankle prosthesis and tested with a transfemoral amputee subject, who successfully performed a wide range of periodic and non-periodic tasks, including low- and high-speed walking, quick start and stop, backward walking, walking over obstacles, and kicking a soccer ball. The proposed approach is expected to provide better understanding of volitional motions and lead to more reliable control of multi-joint prostheses for a wider range of tasks.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the problem of suppressing sloshing dynamics in liquid handling robotic systems has been faced by designing a dynamic filter that starting from the desired motion of the liquid container calculates the complete position/orientation trajectory for the robot end-effector. Specifically, a design philosophy mixing a filtering technique that suppresses the frequency contributions of the reference motion that may cause liquid oscillations and an active compensation of lateral accelerations by a proper container re-orientation has been adopted. In principle, the latter contribution requires the knowledge of acceleration of the reference trajectory, but because of the use of an harmonic smoother that performs a shaping of the original motion, it is possible to obtain the value of the acceleration in runtime. In this way, the proposed methods can be applied also to reference motions that are not known in advance, e.g. commands directly provided by a human operator. This possibility has been demonstrated by means of a number of experimental tests in which the user teleoperates the robot carrying the container with the liquid by simply moving in the free space its hand, whose 3D position is detected by a motion capture system.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper proposes a practical approach for fastening the lengthy experimentational processes that may occur with iterative learning control (ILC) upto a certain level using simple low-order identified models. The traditional practice in ILC experiments is to update the ILC signal by directly using the experimental data after each run of the process which corresponds to one ILC update per one run. When considered from the point of experimental time, even conducting a moderate number of ILC updates can take quite long with this procedure. Since an accurate linear model can adequately represent the actual system upto a certain amplitude and/or frequency of the desired reference, we propose that the total experimental time can be reduced by updating the ILC signal via predicted system data until the limits of the linear model. This approach allows one to carry out large number of ILC updates while not needing to carry out the same amount of real experiments. Consequently, a significant number of experiments that would be needed for achieving the same results can be skipped with a simulation approach. The efficiency of the proposed method was tested through experimentation with three different UAV reference trajectories and the results demonstrated that it is possible to attain significant amount of tracking precision in several flight experiments.",

        "abstract": "Problem benchmarks are used in experimental science as a reference against which results of experiments using distinct approaches to solve the problem are compared and evaluated in relative terms. In Robotics, just formulating a general performance assessment problem is difficult per se, as robot systems are composed of very diverse subsystems (e.g., localisation, human-robot interaction, task planning, motion planning). This paper introduces a probabilistic approach to benchmarking and evaluating performance of robot systems, which uses probability theory as the common language to quantify the performance of distinct functionalities of a robot system and their impact on the performance of a task carried out by that system. The approach can be used to analyse the performance of a task plan from the performances if its composing functionalities, or to (re)plan when a performance degradation in functionality is predicted to cause performance degradation of the task plan beyond acceptable limits.",

        "abstract": "For autonomous multi-robot teams, the individual team members are tasked with completing their assigned tasks as defined by a team plan provided by a centralized team planner. However in complex dynamic domains, the team plans are generated by the team planner with assumptions due to the complexity of modeling the domain. Failures in execution are therefore inevitable for the team members, and as such, replanning will occur for the team. In this paper, we introduce a rationale-driven team plan representation that provides rationales on why actions were chosen by the team planner. During a failure, the individual team members autonomously use our described intra-robot replanning algorithm to select all applicable replan policies for a given rationale. We then describe a method to learn the predicted cost of each replan policy, given a state of the environment, in order for the individual robots to select the lowest costing replan policy to improve team performance.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We are interested in the problem of time-optimal control of omnidirectional robots with bounded acceleration (TOC-ORBA). While there exist approximate solutions for such problems, and exact solutions with unbounded acceleration, exact solvers to the TOC-ORBA problem have remained elusive until now. In this paper, we present a real-time solver for true time-optimal control of omnidirectional robots with bounded acceleration. We first derive the general parameterized form of the solution to the TOC-ORBA problem by application of Pontryagin's maximum principle. We then frame the boundary value problem of TOC-ORBA as an optimization problem over the parameterized control space. To overcome local minima and poor initial guesses to the optimization problem, we introduce a two-stage optimal control solver (TSOCS): The first stage computes an upper bound to the total time for the TOC-ORBA problem and holds the time constant while optimizing the parameters of the trajectory to approach the boundary value conditions. The second stage uses the parameters found by the first stage, and relaxes the constraint on the total time to solve for the parameters of the complete TOC-ORBA problem. Furthermore, we implement TSOCS as a closed loop controller to overcome actuation errors on real robots in realtime. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of TSOCS in simulation and on real robots, showing that 1) it runs in real time, generating solutions in less than 0.5ms on average; 2) it generates faster trajectories compared to an approximate solver; and 3) it is able to solve TOC-ORBA problems with nonzero final velocities that were previously unsolvable in real-time.",

In this paper the effects of the rotors angular speeds on the quadrotor drag, and therefore on the lateral accelerations, are investigated. While these effects are usually disregarded, we analyze their modeling starting from the Blade Element Theory and flight test data. Two lateral acceleration formulations are proposed. They are adopted within a velocity and attitude state estimator and validated in real-world flights. The EKF-based estimator fuses measurements from low-cost sensors present in the majority of quadrotors (IMU, magnetometer, ultrasonic sensor, optical flow) with the accelerations of the vehicle predicted from the revisited models. Experimental results show the benefits of adopting these innovative models in the estimator when compared with the existing modeling approach.",

The 3D point set is then passed to path planning algorithm for a robot manipulator to move an ink-jet nozzle over the wound and fill the cavity with quick-curing/gelling fluids such collagen and other biomaterials and cell growth promoters.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "An effective scheme to simulate low-speed, contact-rich manipulation tasks is to assume quasistatic physics and advance system states by solving linear complementarity problems (LCPs). However, the existing LCP-based quasistatic time-stepping scheme fails to simulate grasping-an essential motion primitive in manipulation-due to two drawbacks specific to quasistatic systems. Firstly, inputs to quasistatic systems are velocity commands instead of torques. This can lead to penetration, and thus an infeasible LCP, when two rigid bodies in contact are commanded to push against each other. Secondly, as multiple force solutions exist for a given velocity command, a grasping velocity command is not guaranteed to generate sufficient grasping forces. In this paper, we reformulate the quasistatic time-stepping scheme as an optimization problem with complementarity constraints and a quadratic objective. By minimizing the difference between actual and commanded velocities, linearized non-penetration constraints can always be satisfied. Moreover, undesirable solutions with insufficient normal forces can be removed by considering elasticity, which is modeled by comparing actual and commanded velocities. The resulting optimization problem is a mixed-integer quadratic program, which can be solved reasonably quickly for small-to-medium-sized systems. The effectiveness of the proposed reformulation is validated by simulation results of systems with different levels of complexity.",

With a static network protocol approach, the affected skin area is unusable after a connection failure. Therefore, we developed a dynamic network protocol for large-scale artificial robotic skins, which re-routes the network upon connection failures to keep the whole skin in operation. Furthermore, the protocol balances the load for driving larger skins without packet loss. For verification, we validated the protocol on a large artificial robot skin we have developed and analyzed its performance with a skin network consisting of up to 204 cells. The failure recovery of the protocol converges in at most 50ms. We showed that the balancing method achieves a packet loss reduction of over 30% compared to the previously used protocol.",

        "abstract": "Complex interactions with unstructured environments require the application of appropriate restoring forces in response to the imposed displacements. Impedance control techniques provide effective solutions to achieve this, however, their quasi-static performance is highly dependent on the choice of parameters, i.e. stiffness and damping. In most cases, such parameters are previously selected by robot programmers to achieve a desired response, which limits the adaptation capability of robots to varying task conditions. To improve the generality of interaction planning through task-dependent regulation of the parameters, this paper introduces a novel self-regulating impedance controller. The regulation of the parameters is achieved based on the robot's local sensory data, and on an interaction expectancy value. This value combines the interaction values from the robot state machine and visual feedback, to authorize the autonomous tuning of the impedance parameters in selective Cartesian axes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated experimentally in a debris removal task.",

        "abstract": "Catheter/guidewire manipulation in endovascu-lar intervention procedures are associated with risks of injury on vessel wall and embolization. Determination of catheter/guidewire-vessel interaction contact forces can improve the navigation process safety and efficiency which prevent injuries in both manual and robotic vascular interventions. This study proposes a sensor-less sensing solution to estimate multiple contact point forces at the side of catheter/guidewire exerted on the vasculature. This goal is achieved by using image feedback of catheter-vessel interaction and numerical finite element modeling (FEM). Real-time image processing algorithms are implemented to track interaction contact points on catheter/guidewire. Image-based deflection measurement and contact points tracking data are given to a nonlinear finite element beam model to estimate the forces. The variable equivalent bending modulus of the guidewire is found through a series of three-point-bending tests. To directly measure contact point forces, an experimental platform is prepared which simulates catheter/guidewire-vessel interaction with two, three and four contact points. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested in six scenarios in which force estimation accuracy of more than 87.9% is achieved. The proposed approach can be applied to various types of under-actuated catheter/guidewire in endovascular intervention procedures. This study proves that multiple catheter/guidewire side contact forces can be estimated by using the deflected shape and equivalent bending modulus property without embedding any force sensor.",

The novelty of the proposed design is due to the deliberate introduction of a compliant element between the actuator and the brake pedal whose deflections are measured to estimate interaction forces and to perform closed-loop force control. Thanks to its series elasticity, the force-feedback brake pedal can utilize robust controllers to achieve high fidelity force control, possesses favorable output impedance characteristics over the entire frequency spectrum, and can be implemented in a compact package using low-cost components. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed series elastic brake pedal have been tested through human subject experiments that evaluate simulated cooperative regenerative braking scenarios with and without pedal feel compensation. The experimental results and responses to the accompanying questionnaire indicate that pedal feel compensation through the series elastic brake pedal can significantly decrease hard braking instances, improving safety and driver experience.",

Sixteen compliant sensing elements are arranged as a 4\u00d74 array. This allows the position-controlled robot to explore objects via palpation. Tactile sensing was accomplished by measuring the change of the magnetic field caused by neodymium magnets embedded into the series elastic elements. We demonstrate the efficacy of our sensor with two sets of experiments involving physical interaction scenarios. Firstly, we show that the sensor can be used to differentiate between rigid and deformable objects. Secondly, we show that point clouds of objects can be generated quickly with our sensor module attached to a position-controlled robot manipulator as an end-effector.",

        "abstract": "Parallel robots exhibit the so-called forward singularities, which complicate substantially the planning and control of their motions. Often, such complications are circumvented by restricting the motions to singularity-free regions of the workspace. However, this comes at the expense of reducing the motion range of the robot substantially. It is for this reason that, recently, efforts are underway to control singularity-crossing trajectories. This paper proposes a reliable controller to stabilize such kind of trajectories. The controller is based on the classical theory of linear quadratic regulators, which we adapt appropriately to the case of parallel robots. As opposed to traditional computed-torque methods, the obtained controller does not rely on expensive inverse dynamics computations. Instead, it uses an optimal control law that is easy to evaluate, and does not generate instabilities at forward singularities. The performance of the controller is exemplified on a five-bar parallel robot accomplishing two tasks that require the traversal of singularities.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a control architecture readily suitable for surface treatment tasks such as polishing, grinding, finishing or deburring as carried out by a human operator, with the added benefit of accuracy, recurrence and physical strength as administered by a robotic manipulator partner. The shared strategy effectively couples the human operator propioceptive abilities and fine skills through his interactions with the autonomous physical agent. The novel proposed control scheme is based on task prioritization and a non-conventional sliding mode control, which is considered to benefit from its inherent robustness and low computational cost. The system relies on two force sensors, one located between the last link of the robot and the surface treatment tool, and the other located in some place of the robot end-effector: the former is used to suitably accomplish the conditioning task, while the latter is used by the operator to manually guide the robotic tool. When the operator chooses to cease guiding the tool, the robot motion safely switches back to an automatic reference tracking. The paper presents the theories for the novel collaborative controller, whilst its effectiveness for robotic surface treatment is substantiated by experimental results using a redundant 7R manipulator and a mock-up conditioning tool.",

The concept comprises a simple soft robot with two embedded permanent magnets with alternating magnetic polarity, and a rotating (nonuniform) dipole magnetic field that is swept over the robot, resulting in a traveling-wave undulatory motion that propels the robot forward and backward. This soft-actuation technology can be fabricated in a wide range of sizes due to its simplicity, and has the potential to be applied in a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic contexts. We conduct experiments and numerical simulations to verify the movement of the soft robot. Then, we confirm the benefits of using nonuniform dipole fields over using uniform fields, as well as the benefits of alternating the polarity of the magnets embedded in the device.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Wearable robotics offers a unique opportunity to explore how biological systems interface with engineered parts. But, due to a gap in understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms at work, the state of the art in design and development is a sophisticated form of automated trial and error. Progress is hampered by the difficulty of assessing the direct impact of wearable robots on underlying muscles, tendons and bones during human experimentation. While animal models have provided an experimental platform to explore other biological mechanisms, as of yet, no animal model of a wearable robot during locomotion has been developed. To fill this gap, we have built the first ever wearable robotic device for a freely-Iocomoting, non-human, bipedal animal (Numida melaegris = Guinea fowl), a species whose gait closely mirrors human locomotion mechanics. We found that a spring-loaded soft-exosuit that passively augments the energy stored in distal tendons was both well tolerated and provided consistent torques. Preliminary data showed birds systematically change their kinematics in response to changes to exo-suit spring stiffness, adjusting the timing but not magnitude of the assistive torques. This animal model for wearable robotics allows experiments up and down the broader spatiotemporal scale that are not currently possible in humans. With it we can address questions from short-term adaptations in musculoskeletal dynamics within a single step to broader behavioral and physical changes that come with long term use.",

        "abstract": "Planning under partial observability is both challenging and critical for reliable robot operation. The past decade has seen substantial advances in this domain: The mathematically principled approach for addressing such problems, namely the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), has started to become practical for various robotics tasks. Good approximate solutions for problems framed as POMDPs can now be computed on-line, with a few classes of problems being solved in near real-time. However, applications of these more recent advances are often hindered by the lack of easy-to-use software tools. Implementation of state of the art algorithms exist, but most (if not all)require the POMDP model to be hard-coded inside the program, increasing the difficulty of applying them. To alleviate this problem, we propose a software toolkit, called On-line POMDP Planning Toolkit (OPPT)(downloadable from http://robotics.itee.uq.edu.au/~oppt). By providing a well-defined and general abstract solver API, OPPT enables the user to quickly implement new POMDP solvers. Furthermore, OPPT provides an easy-to-use plug-in architecture with interfaces to the high-fidelity simulator Gazebo that, in conjunction with user-friendly configuration files, allows users to specify POMDP models of a standard class of robot motion planning under partial observability problems with no additional coding effort.",

This study proposes a method of exoskeleton robot control to estimate the voluntary lower limb muscle activities lost after a spinal cord injury (SCI). This method is based on the spinal cord mapping of the remaining muscle activities and its matching to the one obtained from healthy participants considering the muscle synergy of the whole body during the walking motion. By implementing the matching procedure at the spinal cord map level and incorporating information of reliable and unreliable spinal cord levels based on a diagnosis, the method has the potential to provide a maximally voluntary locomotion for people with SCI. We report an analysis of the synergy of the whole-body muscle activity during walking and its spinal cord mapping using non-negative matrix factorization and the computation of the transformation matrix to estimate the intended lower limb muscle activity from the remaining spinal cord activity. The implementation of the proposed method using the right leg of the hybrid assistive limb and walking experiments with a healthy participant are also reported.",

However, determining whether paths represent different homotopy classes can be difficult to compute. We propose metrics for efficiently approximating the homotopic similarity of two paths are, instead of verifying homotopy equivalence directly. We propose two metrics: (1) a naive application of local planning, a common subroutine of sampling-based motion planning, and (2) a novel approach that reasons about the topologically distinct portions of the workspace that a path visits. We present three applications of our metric to demonstrate its use and effectiveness: extracting topologically distinct paths from an existing roadmap, comparing paths for robot manipulators, and improving the computational efficiency of an existing sampling-based method, Path Deformation Roadmaps (PDRs), by over two orders of magnitude. We explore the trade-off between quality and computational efficiency in the proposed metrics.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Robots deployed in large human-populated indoor environments such as shopping malls, airports etc., inadvertently communicate via wireless networks for enhanced perception and decision making capabilities. Owing to highly dynamic signal attenuation characteristics in such environments, connectivity issues may arise during robotic navigation, leading to disruption in information flow causing potential danger. Exact modeling of signal propagation for estimating spatial signal variation is usually challenging. Moreover, the presence of dynamic humans also add a layer of temporal signal variation complexities. Thus, this paper introduces a generative approach for embedding radio signal strength constraints within networked service/social robot navigation in large human-populated environments. Initially, we propose a Gaussian Process based online spatio-temporal signal strength prediction model that, as opposed to the current state of the art, also aims to take into account the temporal fading arising due to the presence of human crowds. We then devise a transient-goal driven navigation strategy to realize a sub-optimal path towards a goal, that is aimed at resolving both communication-aware and human-aware planning constraints. Evaluations of the proposed signal prediction model demonstrate the advantages of our approach with respect to the current state of the art. The efficacy of the navigation strategy in also demonstrated simulations and using hardware experiments conducted on a robotic wheelchair operating in a large shopping mall.",

Second, we describe commonly used error metrics (i.e., the absolute trajectory error and the relative error) and their strengths and weaknesses.

        "abstract": "Emerging applications of robotic manipulation of deformable objects have opened up new challenges in robot control. While several control techniques have been developed to manipulate deformable objects, the performance of existing methods is commonly limited by two issues: 1) implicit assumption that the physical contact between the end-effector and the object is always maintained, and 2) requirements of exact parameters of deformation model, which are difficult to obtain. This paper presents a new control scheme for robotic manipulation of deformable objects, which allows the robot to automatically contact then actively deform the deformable object by assessing the status of deformation in real time. Instead of designing multiple controllers and switching among them, the proposed method smoothly and stably integrates two control phases (i.e. region reaching and active deforming) into a single controller. The stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously proved with the consideration of the uncertain deformation model and uncalibrated cameras. Hence, the proposed control scheme enhances the autonomous capability of active deformable object manipulation. Experimental studies are conducted with different initial conditions to demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become popular in a wide range of applications, including many military and civilian uses. State of the art control strategies for these vehicles are typically limited to a portion of the vehicle's flight envelope, and are tailored to a specific type of platform. This article presents a single physics-based controller capable of aggressive maneuvering for the majority of UAVs. The controller is applicable to UAVs with the ability to apply a force along a body-fixed direction, and a moment about an arbitrary axis, which includes UAVs such as multi-copters, conventional fixed-wing, agile fixed-wing, flying-wing with two thrusters, most tailsitters, and some tilt-rotor/wing platforms. We demonstrate autonomous flight for a quadrotor and agile fixed-wing aircraft in a simulation environment. To specifically demonstrate the extreme maneuvering capability of the control logic, we perform a rolling flip with the quadrotor and an aggressive turnaround with the fixed-wing aircraft, all using a single controller with a single set of gains.",

In this research, we propose a novel design for a granular-jamming-based gripper which uses a transparent filling and a semi-transparent membrane to allow optical sensing to detect both deformation of the membrane and the object being grasped. By adjusting the refractive index of an oil mixture to the refractive index of the granular bodies, we produced a fully transparent filling that allows the use of a camera inside the universal gripper. In this paper, we present the materials and development of our prototype, and describe the experimental confirmation of the prototype's performance. We showed that our prototype was able to grasp cylindrical and rectangular objects between 10 to 70 mm length while also tracking the deformation of the gripper.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a soft actuator embedded with conductive liquid metal and shape memory epoxy (SME) which function together to enable self-sensing, tunable mechanical degrees of freedom (DoF), and variable stiffness. We embedded thermoplastic shape memory epoxy in the bottom portion of the actuator. Different sections of the SME could be selectively softened by an implanted conductive silver yarn located at different positions. When an electric current passes through the conductive silver yarn, it induces a phase transition that changes the epoxy from stiff state to compliant state. Each section of SME could be softened within 5 s by applying a current of 200 mA to the silver yarn. To acquire the strain curvature, eGaIn was infused into a microchannel surrounding the chambers of the soft actuator. A spiral-shaped eGaIn sensor was also attached to the tip of the actuator to perceive the contact with reliable dynamic force response. Systematic experiments were performed to characterize the stiffness, tunable DoF, and sensing property. We show the ability of the soft composite actuator to support a weight of 200g at the tip (as a cantilever) while maintaining the shape and the ability to recover its original shape after large bending deformation. In particular, seven different motion patterns could be achieved under the same pneumatic pressure of the actuator due to selectively heating the SME sections. A gripper which was fabricated by assembling two actuators to a base was able to grasp the weight up to 56 times of a single actuator through an appropriate motion pattern. For demonstration purposes, the gripper was used to grasp various objects by adjusting the DoF and stiffness with real-time feedback of the bending strain and the contact force.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a feature encoding method of complex 3D objects for high-level semantic features. Recent approaches to object recognition methods become important for semantic simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, there is a lack of consideration of the probabilistic observation model for 3D objects, as the shape of a 3D object basically follows a complex probability distribution. Furthermore, since the mobile robot equipped with a range sensor observes only a single view, much information of the object shape is discarded. These limitations are the major obstacles to semantic SLAM and view-independent loop closure using 3D object shapes as features. In order to enable the numerical analysis for the Bayesian inference, we approximate the true observation model of 3D objects to tractable distributions. Since the observation likelihood can be obtained from the generative model, we formulate the true generative model for 3D object with the Bayesian networks. To capture these complex distributions, we apply a variational auto-encoder. To analyze the approximated distributions and encoded features, we perform classification with maximum likelihood estimation and shape retrieval.",

However, there is a plethora of existing databases, each with its own set of features, but none designed with robotic use cases in mind. This work presents three main contributions: (a) structures for benchmarking scenarios with a focus on networked multi-robot architectures, (b) an extensible workbench for benchmarking databases for different scenarios that makes use of Docker containers and (c) a comparison of existing databases given a set of multi-robot use cases to showcase the usage of the framework. The comparison gives indications for choosing an appropriate database.",

The model uses distributed consensus to coordinate actions and to maintain formation via geometric constraints.

To account for noisy and missing target detections, the robots exchange their estimated target position and formation configuration through shared PID-controlled steering responses.

As expected, experimental results show that the more various measurements are combined, the more accurate and robust is the tracker. The corresponding C++ source code is available for the community in the ViSP library.",

Current approaches for eliminating cumulative drift are mainly based on the pose graph optimization under the constraint of scan-matching factors. The misaligned edges in the graph may have negative impacts on the results. To address this problem and further handle inconsistency caused by multi-task acquisitions in urban environments, we introduce a refined structure of the factor graph considering systematical initialization bias, where the scan-matching factors are twice validated through a novel classifier and a robust optimization strategy. In addition, we incorporate a multi-hypothesis extended Kalman filter (MH-EKF) to remove dynamic objects. Quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of map quality.",

        "abstract": "In 1999 Sony released the AlBO Entertainment Robot, selling more than 150,000 units worldwide until 2006. By 2014, Sony had stopped offering upgrades and maintenance for the product, and owners were faced with the fact their pet-like robots would \u201cdie\u201d. Some shrines and temples in Japan hold ningyo kuy\u014d or mass funerals for dolls and other toys. At the suggestion of a small Japanese tech-repair company called A-Fun, one temple began offering a Buddhist funeral ceremony for AIBOs. Approximately 700 AIBOs have so far received a funeral service. This paper surveys A-Fun\u2018s maintenance services for old AIBOs, the AIBO funerals, and Sony's new 2018 AIBO release, in the cross-disciplinary context of human-machine relations in Japan and elsewhere. Drawing on the author's interviews with key actors, it articulates links between philosophy and neuroscience to explain tendencies toward zoomorphism in robot design. Perceiving presence (sonzai kan) and sensibility (kansei) in objects is a culturally contingent phenomenon. Whereas ways of conceiving the partly animate are largely absent from Western philosophy, in the case of AIBO ownership in Japan there is a reverential mindfulness of the technology's inherent contradictions.",

        "abstract": "Precise Point Positioning (PPP) offers advantages over Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning in that it needs no ground base station or a rover to provide a communication channel with the base station. Therefore, PPP is expected to be applied in various fields, such as precise agriculture, intelligent transportation, construction, and mining. One major drawback of PPP is that it takes several tens of minutes for initial convergence to reach an adequate level of accuracy, and how to shorten the convergence time remains the key issue regarding the proliferation of PPP. In our previous work, we proposed a method of drastically reducing this initial convergence time of PPP (called \u201cARIADNE\u201d) by using an accurate fiducial marker whose position in Earth-fixed coordinates has been accurately measured using an onboard camera. In this contribution, in order to improve both the positioning accuracy and reliability, we introduce some new techniques to ARIADNE: (1) carrier phase ambiguity resolution (AR); and (2) estimating displacement of the marker's orientation. AR results in doubling the positioning accuracy, while displacement estimation enables the detection of any change in the marker's installation orientation and compensation for the effect thereof in the initialization process. Analytical results based on actual data acquired with a prototype system show that the above method and techniques work very well with a realistic setup of PPP-AR and marker performance, and successfully reduce the initial convergence time from tens of minutes to less than a minute.",

Built on such a novel observation, we design two new algorithms - Mean First Passage Time based Q-Learning (MFPT-Q)and Mean First Passage Time based DYNA (MFPT-DYNA), that have been fundamentally modified from the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques. Preliminary results have shown that our hybrid approaches converge with much fewer iterations than their corresponding state-of-the-art counterparts and therefore requiring much fewer samples and much fewer training trials to converge.",

        "abstract": "We propose using the Successor Representation (SR) to accelerate learning in a constructive knowledge system based on General Value Functions (GVFs). In real-world settings, like robotics for unstructured and dynamic environments, it is impossible to model all meaningful aspects of a system and its environment by hand. Instead, robots must learn and adapt to changes in their environment and task, incrementally constructing models from their own experience. GVFs, taken from the field of reinforcement learning (RL), are a way of modeling the world as predictive questions. One approach to such models proposes a massive network of interconnected and interdependent GVFs, which are incrementally added over time. It is reasonable to expect that new, incrementally added predictions can be learned more swiftly if the learning process leverages knowledge gained from past experience. The SR provides a means of capturing regularities that can be reused across multiple GVFs by separating the dynamics of the world from the prediction targets. As a primary contribution of this work, we show that using the SR can improve sample efficiency and learning speed of GVFs in a continual learning setting where new predictions are incrementally added and learned over time. We analyze our approach in a grid-world and then demonstrate its potential on data from a physical robot arm.",

        "abstract": "Deformable objects like cloth and rope are challenging to manipulate because it is difficult to predict the state of the object given a motion of the gripper(s) holding it. In much previous work, physical models (such as Mass-Spring or Finite-Element) have been used to model such affects. However, these models often require significant parameter tuning for each scenario and can be expensive to simulate inside a control loop. Furthermore, it is difficult to create a practical controller for deformable object manipulation that preserves constraints, especially avoiding overstretching the object. In this paper, we developed a more effective controller than previous work by (1) constructing a more accurate geometric model of how the direction of gripper motion and obstacles affect deformable objects; and (2) specifying a novel stretching avoidance constraint to prevent the object from being overstretched by the robot. Experiments comparing our new method to the previous method in simulation and on a physical robot suggest that our new model captures the behavior of the object more accurately. We also find that our controller is able to prevent tearing that would occur when using the previous method.",

        "abstract": "Highly accurate mapping and localization is of prime importance for mobile robotics, and its core lies in efficient scan matching. Previous research are focusing on designing a robust objective function and the residual error distribution is often ignored or simply assumed as unitary or mixture of simple distributions. In this paper, a mixture of exponential power (MoEP) distributions is proposed to approximate the residual error distribution. The objective function induced by MoEP-based residual error modelling ensembles a mix-norm-based scan matching (MiNoM), which enhances the matching accuracy and convergence characteristic. Both the parameters of transformation (rotation and translation) and residual error distribution are estimated efficiently via an EM-like algorithm. The optimization of MiNoM is iteratively achieved via two phases: An on-line parameter learning (OPL) phase to learn residual error distribution for better representation according to the likelihood field model (LFM), and an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) phase to attain transformation for accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experimental results validate that the proposed MiNoM out-performs several state-of-the-art scan matching algorithms in both convergence characteristic and matching accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Prefabrication of structures is currently used in a limited capacity, due to the lack of flexibility, despite the potential cost and speed advantages. Autonomous flexible reassembly enables structures to be developed which can be continuously and iteratively dis-assembled and re-assembled providing far more flexibility in comparison to single shot pre-fabrication methods. Dis-assembly of structures should be considered when assembling, due to the asymmetry of assembly and dis-assembly processes, to ensure structures can be recycled and re-assembled. This allows for agile development, significantly reducing the time and resource usage during the build process. In this work, a framework for flexible re-assembly is developed and a robotic platform is developed to implement and test this framework with simple Lego bricks. The tradeoffs in terms of time, resource use and probability of success of this new assembly method can be understood by using a cost function to compare to alternative fabrication methods.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel sensing method for soft pneumatic actuators. The method uses a single microphone, embedded into the actuator's air chamber. Contact with the environment induces sound (vibration) in the actuator. The materials and the shape of the actuator reflect, refract, and attenuate the sound as it propagates inside the actuator. This produces a unique sound signature for different types of events, enabling the sensing of contact locations, contact force, and the type of contacted material. Sensing is insensitive to the inflation state of the actuator and to background noise. We demonstrate the robustness and versatility of the microphone-based sensor solution in experiments with a PneuFlex actuator. The proposed sensorization avoids the fundamental challenges of sensorizing soft pneumatic actuators, because the placement of a microphone does not negatively affect the compliance of the actuator and because a single microphone suffices for sensorization of the entire actuator, eliminating the need for an application-specific sensor layout.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an underwater robotic sensor system for localizing acoustic transmitters when the robot's hydrophones cannot be time-synchronized. The development of the system is motivated by applications where tracking of marine animals that are tagged with an underwater acoustic transmitter is required. The system uses two novel real-time calibration algorithms that improve the accuracy of time of flight (TOF) and time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements. The first algorithm corrects non-linear clock skews in TOF measurements based on temperature variation. The second algorithm compensates the localized relative clock skew between clocks using a mixed integer linear program. To validate the system's performance, an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) was deployed to track a moving tag where GPS data was used as ground truth. Compared to traditional TOF and TDOA filtering methods, the results show that the proposed system can achieve reduction of mean localization errors by 59%, and a reduction of the standard deviation of measurements by 44%.",

        "abstract": "Robots operating in human environments are often required to recognise, grasp and manipulate objects. Identifying the locations of objects amongst their complex surroundings is therefore an important capability. However, when environments are unstructured and cluttered, as is typical for indoor human environments, reliable and accurate object segmentation is not always possible because the scene representation is often incomplete or ambiguous. We overcome the limitations of static object segmentation by enabling a robot to directly interact with the scene with non-prehensile actions. Our method does not rely on object models to infer object existence. Rather, interaction induces scene motion and this provides an additional clue for associating observed parts to the same object. We use a probabilistic segmentation framework in order to identify segmentation uncertainty. This uncertainty is then used to guide a robot while it manipulates the scene. Our probabilistic segmentation approach recursively updates the segmentation given the motion cues and the segmentation is monitored during interaction, thus providing online feedback. Experiments performed with RGB-D data show that the additional source of information from motion enables more certain object segmentation that was otherwise ambiguous. We then show that our interaction approach based on segmentation uncertainty maintains higher quality segmentation than competing methods with increasing clutter.",

The designed tailsitter contains one flying-wing with two motors and two elevons. Vehicle aerodynamics and a six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) model are especially developed for the tailsitter. To achieve a good performance in outdoor stationary hovering and accurate vertical flying, the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) for attitude controller is proposed. With signals from extended state observer (ESO) and tracking differentiator (TD), ADRC decouples the system model into a controllable chain of integrators. Based on the decoupled system dynamics, the motion of tailsitter can be easily handled by developed position controller. Experimental results are presented to corroborate the effectiveness of the controller in disturbance rejection.",

        "abstract": "Robots can rapidly acquire new skills from demonstrations. However, during generalisation of skills or transitioning across fundamentally different skills, it is unclear whether the robot has the necessary knowledge to perform the task. Failing to detect missing information often leads to abrupt movements or to collisions with the environment. Active learning can quantify the uncertainty of performing the task and, in general, locate regions of missing information. We introduce a novel algorithm for active learning and demonstrate its utility for generating smooth trajectories. Our approach is based on deep generative models and metric learning in latent spaces. It relies on the Jacobian of the likelihood to detect non-smooth transitions in the latent space, i.e., transitions that lead to abrupt changes in the movement of the robot. When non-smooth transitions are detected, our algorithm asks for an additional demonstration from that specific region. The newly acquired knowledge modifies the data manifold and allows for learning a latent representation for generating smooth movements. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on generalising elementary skills, transitioning across different skills, and implicitly avoiding collisions with the environment. For our experiments, we use a simulated pendulum where we observe its motion from images and a 7-DoF anthropomorphic arm.",

Solving long-horizon problems in complex domains requires flexible generative planning that can combine primitive abilities in novel combinations to solve problems as they arise in the world. In order to plan to combine primitive actions, we must have models of the preconditions and effects of those actions: under what circumstances will executing this primitive achieve some particular effect in the world? We use, and develop novel improvements on, state-of-the-art methods for active learning and sampling. We use Gaussian process methods for learning the conditions of operator effectiveness from small numbers of expensive training examples collected by experimentation on a robot. We develop adaptive sampling methods for generating diverse elements of continuous sets (such as robot configurations and object poses) during planning for solving a new task, so that planning is as efficient as possible. We demonstrate these methods in an integrated system, combining newly learned models with an efficient continuous-space robot task and motion planner to learn to solve long horizon problems more efficiently than was previously possible.",

While scene-driven visual navigation has been widely studied, prior efforts on learning navigation policies for robots to find objects are limited. The problem is often more challenging than target scene finding as the target objects can be very small in the view and can be in an arbitrary pose. We approach the problem from an active perceiver perspective, and propose a novel framework that integrates a deep neural network based object recognition module and a deep reinforcement learning based action prediction mechanism. To validate our method, we conduct experiments on both a simulation dataset (AI2-THOR)and a real-world environment with a physical robot. We further propose a new decaying reward function to learn the control policy specific to the object searching task. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our method, which outperforms competing methods in both average trajectory length and success rate.",

        "abstract": "3D radiation source localization is a common task across applications such as decommissioning, disaster response, and security, but traditional count-based sensors struggle to efficiently disambiguate between symmetries in sensor, source, and environment configurations. Recent works have demonstrated successful passive source localization using a bearing sensor called the Compton gamma camera that can image radiation. This paper first presents an approach to mapping the spatial distribution of radiation with a gamma camera to estimate source locations. An active source localization framework is then developed that greedily selects new waypoints that maximize the Fisher Information provided by the camera's range and bearing observations for source localization. Finally the common assumption of a static step size in between waypoints is relaxed to allow step sizes to adapt online to the observed information. The proposed radiation mapping approach is evaluated in 5\u00d74 m2 and 14\u00d76 m2 laboratory environments, where multiple point sources were localized to within an average of 0.26 m or 0.6% of the environment dimensions. The active source localization approach is evaluated in simulation and an adaptive step size yields a 27% decrease in the localization time and a 16% decrease in the distance traveled to localize a source in a 15\u00d715\u00d715 m3 environment.",

        "abstract": "A reliable estimation of 3D parameters is a must for several applications like planning and control, in which is included Image-Based Visual Servoing. This control scheme depends directly on 3D parameters, e.g. depth of points, and/or depth and direction of 3D straight lines. Recently, a framework for Active Structure-from-Motion was proposed, addressing the former feature type. However, straight lines were not addressed. These are 1D objects, which allow for more robust detection, and tracking. In this work, the problem of Active Structure-from-Motion for 3D straight lines is addressed. An explicit representation of these features is presented, and a change of variables is proposed. The latter allows the dynamics of the line to respect the conditions for observability of the framework. A control law is used with the purpose of keeping the control effort reasonable, while achieving a desired convergence rate. The approach is validated first in simulation for a single line, and second using a real robot setup. The latter set of experiments are conducted first for a single line, and then for three lines.",

A model-based controller, PD with computed feedforward, is implemented for a parallel robot taking into consideration the formulated dynamics. The motivation behind this contribution is to enhance the control performance by compensating the unfavourable nonlinearities abundant extensively in PKMs. Those nonlinearities may increase considerably when operating at high-speed motions. The proposed feedforward part relies on the reference trajectories instead of the measured ones improving the control performance and the computational efforts. To validate our contribution, real-time experiments are conducted on a four degree-of-freedom parallel robot named VELOCE in different operating conditions.",

The main feature of the architecture is its combination of a task-priority (TP) kinematic control algorithm with a custom force control strategy, based on impedance (admittance) control. The TP algorithm used in the work includes recent treatment of equality and inequality tasks as well as original concepts to handle operation in singular configurations of the system. In the force control part the impedance concept is extended to allow for direct control over the value of exerted force and torque. Additional feed-forward signal is used to ensure stable contact. The performance of the control architecture is demonstrated by experiments in a test tank, with GIRONA500 I-AUV performing pipe inspection.",

We introduce a grasp selection algorithm that ranks grasp candidates with a set of grasp metrics augmented with object features, creating an approach that adapts its strategies based on user-specified grasp preferences. We formulate grasp selection as a pairwise ranking problem, which significantly reduces data collection compared to traditional grasp ranking methods and generalizes to novel objects. Our approach outperforms a state-of-the-art grasp calculation baseline and a pointwise ranking formulation of the same problem.",

        "abstract": "State-of-the-art monocular dense mapping methods usually divide the image sequence into several separate multi-view stereo problems thus have limited utilization of the information in multi-baseline observations and sequential depth estimations. In this paper, two core contributions are proposed to improve the mapping performance by exploiting the information. The first is an adaptive baseline matching cost computation that uses the sequential input images to provide each pixel with wide-baseline observations. The second is a frame-to-frame propagated depth filter which integrates the sequential depth estimation of the same physical point in a robust probabilistic manner. Two contributions are integrated into a monocular dense mapping system that generates the depth maps in real-time for both pinhole and fisheye cameras. Our system is fully parallelized and can run at more than 25 fps on a Nvidia Jetson TX2. We compare our work with state-of-the-art methods on the public dataset. Onboard UAV mapping and handhold experiments are also used to demonstrate the performance of our method. For the benefit of the community, we make the implementation open source.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an adaptive knee-joint based Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES)method to correct the foot drop of paretic patients during swing phase. The rationale behind the adaptive FES is to amplify dorsiflexor stimulation in the late swing when it is most needed in order to face the increased plantar flexor co-contraction as gastrocnemius muscles are stretched by knee re-extension. To accurately detect the swing phase (i.e., toes off (TO)and initial contact (IC)), a novel algorithm is proposed by using a foot-mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU). The proposed strategy is verified by experiments conducted with three healthy subjects and three paretic patients. The experimental results show that highly accurate detection of TO/I C can be achieved under different walking speeds and foot contact conditions (normal and abnormal gaits). The clinical experimental results with paretic patients also reveal that similar effects on ankle dorsiflexion can be observed during mid and late swing using the proposed adaptive FES with respect to the classical FES method, while the adaptive FES used lower stimulation intensity.",

        "abstract": "Interaction of socially assistive robots with users is based on social cues coming from different interaction modalities, such as speech or gestures. However, using all modalities at all times may be inefficient as it can overload the user with redundant information and increase the task completion time. Additionally, users may favor certain modalities over the other as a result of their disability or personal preference. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Modality Selection (AMS) algorithm that chooses modalities depending on the state of the user and the environment, as well as user preferences. The variables that describe the environment and the user state are defined as resources, and we posit that modalities are successful if certain resources possess specific values during their use. Besides the resources, the proposed algorithm takes into account user preferences which it learns while interacting with users. We tested our algorithm in simulations, and we implemented it on a robotic system that provides cognitive training, specifically Sequential memory exercises. Experimental results show that it is possible to use only a subset of available modalities without compromising the interaction. Moreover, we see a trend for users to perform better when interacting with a system with implemented AMS algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Robots and automated systems are increasingly being introduced to unknown and dynamic environments where they are required to handle disturbances, unmodeled dynamics, and parametric uncertainties. Robust and adaptive control strategies are required to achieve high performance in these dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive model predictive controller that combines model predictive control (MPC) with an underlying L1 adaptive controller to improve trajectory tracking of a system subject to unknown and changing disturbances. The L1 adaptive controller forces the system to behave in a predefined way, as specified by a reference model. A higher-level model predictive controller then uses this reference model to calculate the optimal reference input based on a cost function, while taking into account input and state constraints. We focus on the experimental validation of the proposed approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in experiments on a quadrotor. We show that the proposed approach has a lower trajectory tracking error compared to non-predictive, adaptive approaches and a predictive, nonadaptive approach, even when external wind disturbances are applied.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the straight path following problem for a class of underactuated bio-inspired snake robots on ground with unknown and varied friction coefficients. Existing works usually design control input requiring the exact values of these friction coefficients, which however rely on the specific operating terrain and may not always be known a priori. By virtue of backstepping technique, we present a novel adaptive controller that can compensate for unknown and varied friction coefficients in real-time. Moreover, it is proved via LaSalle-Yoshizawa theorem that the path following errors converge to zero asymptotically and all the parameter estimates are bounded. Simulations and experiments on an 8-link snake robot are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.",

        "abstract": "The predictive functions that permit humans to infer their body state by sensorimotor integration are critical to perform safe interaction in complex environments. These functions are adaptive and robust to non-linear actuators and noisy sensory information. This paper introduces a computational perceptual model based on predictive processing that enables any multisensory robot to learn, infer and update its body configuration when using arbitrary sensors with Gaussian additive noise. The proposed method integrates different sources of information (tactile, visual and proprioceptive) to drive the robot belief to its current body configuration. The motivation is to provide robots with the embodied perception needed for self-calibration and safe physical human-robot interaction. We formulate body learning as obtaining the forward model that encodes the sensor values depending on the body variables, and we solve it by Gaussian process regression. We model body estimation as minimizing the discrepancy between the robot body configuration belief and the observed posterior. We minimize the variational free energy using the sensory prediction errors (sensed vs expected). In order to evaluate the model we test it on a real multi-sensory robotic arm. We show how different sensor modalities contributions, included as additive errors, improve the refinement of the body estimation and how the system adapts itself to provide the most plausible solution even when injecting strong sensory visuo-tactile perturbations. We further analyse the reliability of the model when different sensor modalities are disabled. This provides grounded evidence about the correctness of the perceptual model and shows how the robot estimates and adjusts its body configuration just by means of sensory information.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Nine degrees of freedom (DOF) inertial measurement units (IMUs) comprised of three-axis magnetometers, three-axis accelerometers, and three-axis angular rate sensors are commonly used in attitude and heading reference systems (AHRSs). Two classes of AHRSs exist: systems that estimate true-North heading and systems that estimate magnetic-North heading. True-North heading AHRSs require high-end angular rate sensors which are sensitive enough to dynamically estimate Earth-rate (typically fiber-optic and ring-laser gyros), while magnetic-North AHRSs employ gyros that are not sensitive enough to dynamically estimate Earth-rate (i.e. all MEMS gyros). Thus, magnetic-North AHRSs employ magnetometers for estimating heading. This paper will focus on this class of magnetic-North AHRSs. These systems fuse IMU measurements to generate estimates of the instrument's roll, pitch, and magnetic heading. However, their accuracy is limited by sensor measurement bias that is unknown a priori. Hence, accurate sensor bias estimation and compensation is essential for true attitude estimation. This paper reports a novel adaptive sensor bias observer for sensor measurement biases in 9-DOF IMUs. The algorithm requires smaller angular movements of the instrument than other reported sensor bias calibration methods, does not require a priori knowledge of local fields like the local magnetic field or the local gravity vector, and does not require knowledge of the attitude of the instrument. Stability proofs, preliminary simulations, and a full-scale vehicle experimental evaluation are reported.",

        "abstract": "To perform a home service task through cooperation with a human in a real environment, a robot needs to deal with the environmental changes and accordingly plan appropriate behavior sequence. For this purpose, in this paper, we propose an adaptive task planner which is based on memory and reasoning. A robot perceives user behaviors and objects using an RGB-depth and thermal sensor. The robot stores a temporal sequence of behaviors for performing a task in its episodic memory that is realized by a sequence to sequence network. When the user command is given, the episodic memory is used to retrieve the behavior sequence to carry out the command. On the other hand, when the robot perceives user behaviors, the robot postpones its behavior till his/her behavior is stopped. Once stopped, the episodic memory retrieves the behavior sequence to conduct a task that the user has intended. A task scheduler schedules the behavior sequence from the memory and sends it to an internal simulator. The internal simulator confirms the behavior sequence to be executable and then if executable, it sends the next executable behavior to the execution module. If a behavior fails in the internal simulation test, fast forward planner generates an alternative behavior sequence to resolve the failed behavior problem. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed planner is demonstrated by a wheel-based humanoid robot.",

In many cases, the system needs to keep track of targets it has never seen before, and the only training sample available is the specified object in the initial frame. In this paper, we propose a deep architecture called adversarial transfer networks (ATNet), which aims to make well use of offline video training data and solve the problem of lacking training samples in visual tracking. Different from most existing trackers which neglect significant differences between videos and gulp the training data all together, our method utilizes the special nature of tracking problem and concentrates on transferring domain-specific information across similar tracking tasks. We first propose an efficient way to select a training video that is most similar to online tracking task and regard it as source domain. With the labeled data in the selected source domain, we apply adversarial transfer learning to make the feature distribution of source-domain samples and target-domain samples as similar as possible. Therefore, the transferred source-domain samples can provide various possible appearance of tracked target for training and boost the tracking performance. Experimental results on three OTB tracking benchmarks show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art trackers in both accuracy and robustness.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of choosing measurement locations of an aerial robot in an online manner in order to localize an animal with a radio collar. The aerial robot has a commercial, low-cost directional antenna and USB receiver to capture the signal. It uses its own movement to obtain a bearing measurement. The uncertainty in these measurements is assumed to be bounded and represented as wedges. The measurements are then merged by intersecting the wedges. The localization uncertainty is quantified by the area of the resulting intersection. The goal is to reduce the localization uncertainty to a value below a given threshold in minimum time. We present an online strategy to choose measurement locations during execution based on previous readings and analyze its performance with competitive analysis. The time required to localize a target is upper-bounded by the function of measurement noise, desired localization uncertainty and minimum step length. We also validate the strategy in extensive simulations and show its applicability through field experiments over a 5 hectare area using an autonomous aerial robot equipped with a directional antenna.",

        "abstract": "Affordances provide a natural means for a robot to describe its agency as actions it can perform on objects. Further, affordances can enable robots to reason complicated, multi-step tasks that involve proper use of a diversity of objects. This paper proposes the concept of affordance wayfields for representing manipulation affordances as objective functions in configuration space. Affordance wayfields quantify how well a path, or sequence of motions, will accomplish an afforded action on an object. Paths that enact affordances can be located by performing a randomized form of gradient descent over affordance wayfields. Incorporating obstacles, or other constraints into wayfields allows our method to adaptively generate valid motions for executing afforded actions. We demonstrate that affordance wayfields can enable robots, such as the Michigan Progress Fetch mobile manipulator, to solve complex real-world tasks such as assembling a table, or loading and unloading objects from a storage chest.",

The negotiation is implemented using only motion and common navigation sensors, without explicit message-passing. Our goal is for the correct agent to take priority, as decided both by time-efficiency and as judged subjectively by naive human participants. Our contribution is a practical method for doorway negotiation, and a study of human users' responses to a robot that appears to participate in existing social customs surrounding doors.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Vehicles with car-like kinematics are ubiquitous, therefore an ability to algorithmize (i.e., how to plan and effectively execute) complex maneuvers in the presence of obstacles is vital to mobile robotics and intelligent vehicles. Traditionally, this problem is solved using the well known motion planning algorithms, which generate the open-loop control signals neglecting the effects of measurement noises, modeling uncertainties and imperfect robot actuation. While such effects can be compensated to some extent by online replanning, the application of feedback control algorithms to motion execution is unavoidable if robustness of the system is desired. Consequently, the recent works focus on integration of both motion planning and control algorithms to obtain motion plans robust to uncertainty of the initial conditions. In accordance with this trend, we propose a modified VFO (Vector Field Orientation) control law, which is designed to satisfy the state and input constraints resulting from the presence of obstacles in the environment, respect the steering angle limits in conjunction with steering dynamics of the car-like robot, and preserve continuity of the control input signals. Thanks to analytic characterization of admissible funnels (i.e. positively invariant subsets of the configuration space) developed from an analysis of the VFO control law, we guarantee satisfaction of all the mentioned constraints in the continuous domains of time and configuration space of the robot without sacrificing computational efficiency of the planning process. A specific funnel is planned with a highly parallelized deterministic sampling-based algorithm achieving quasi-real-time performance.",

Swarm is modeled as a homogeneous collection of irreducible Markov chains. States of the Markov chain represent the tasks performed by the swarm. The target state is a pre-defined distribution of agents over the states of the Markov chain (and thus the tasks). We make use of ergodicity property of irreducible Markov chains to ensure that as an individual agent converges to the desired behavior in time, the swarm converges to the target state. To circumvent the problems faced by a global controller and local/decentralized controllers alone, we design a controller by combining global supervision with local-feedback-based state level decisions. Some numerical experiments are shown to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.",

A control strategy for the whole system, which consists of the CDPR and the stabilizer, and with one purpose for each-position control for the platform and vibration damping for the stabilizer-is designed. The system being controlled at two different time scales, the singular perturbation theory can be used to prove the stability of the corresponding closed-loop system.

It then presents an actuator design criterion derived from this formula that maximizes the robot's ability to recover. In this study, it is assumed that the robot is using a single major joint (e.g, a hip joint) to perform its balance recovery movement, and that the actuator consists of an electric motor and reduction gear. It is also assumed that the robot's support polygon is sufficiently small that it can be approximated as a point, and that the balance recovery motion is essentially planar, so that a 2-D analysis remains valid in 3-D. Finally, it is assumed that, for the purpose of studying balance recovery motion, the robot can be approximated by a reaction wheel pendulum. The theory has been tested experimentally on a robot designed to be good at balancing, and was found to agree closely with experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Conventional skid or wheel based helicopter landing gears severely limit off-field landing possibilities, which are crucial when operating in scenarios such as mountain rescue. In this context, slopes beyond 8\u00b0 and small obstacles can already pose a substantial hazard. An adaptive landing gear is proposed to overcome these limitations. It consists of four legs with one degree of freedom each. The total weight was minimized to demonstrate economic practicability. This was achieved by an innovative actuation, composed of a parallel arrangement of motor and brake, which relieves the motor from large impact loads during hard landings. The loads are alleviated by a spring-damper system acting in series to the actuation. Each leg is individually force controlled for optimal load distribution on compliant ground and to avoid tipping. The operation of the legs is fully autonomous during the landing phase. A prototype was designed and successfully tested on an unmanned helicopter with a maximum take-off weight of 78 kg. Finally, the implementation of the landing gear concept on aircraft of various scales was discussed.",

        "abstract": "A new approach for cellular robots is presented. The single elements of the robot are triangular cells, which can change their shape by means of linear actuators at each edge. The novelty concerns the connection of autonomous cells at their edges rather than at the vertices. In this way, unstructured triangular meshes can be formed. The robot can self-reconfigure and thus can reproduce almost arbitrary planar shapes. In a similar way, the system has been realized with tetrahedrons in a simplified way within a previous work. The self-reconfigurable system shall serve as a basis for programmable matter. The present paper includes the mechatronic design, its components and the kinematic model of the cellular robot. In order to reduce positioning errors, a model is developed, which considers compliance and clearance in the links and joints. Based on a simplified mechanical model using elastic trusses, the positioning errors can be predicted. The parameters of these models are identified from simple motion sequences. Furthermore, the nonlinearity of actuators is identified and corrected. In this way, the desired triangular shapes can be prescribed without measuring the position of the cells.",

Conventional grippers require complicated compliant mechanisms or complicated control strategy and force sensing to successfully insert pegs into holes. Different from them, this paper proposes a simple gripper with an L-shape finger as a low-cost peg-in-hole solution. The basic idea is to divide a peg-in-hole process into a preparation phase and an execution phase, and eliminate uncertainty step-by-step by pushing using the L-shape finger in the preparation phase. The robustness of the gripper for peg-in-hole tasks is examined by repeated executions for different pegs in the International Robotic Exhibition 2017 (IREX) in Tokyo. The experimental section presents details of the executions, and qualitatively shows the high performance of the proposed gripper.",

However, to be able to do both delicate and high-force demanding work, adjustable force sensitivity would be beneficial. The current paper proposes such a sensor by implementing a planar electromagnet above a 3-axis magnetic sensor, separated by soft foam. Furthermore, the sensor has digital output with an integrated microcontroller. The magnetic field strength with varying currents is examined in simulation, and the field changes according to displacements are investigated both in simulation and with the actual sensor. A prototype 3-axis force sensor is implemented and the relationship between the magnetic field change and the corresponding applied force is also investigated. It could be shown that the sensitivity of the sensor to displacements, as well as force, can indeed be adjusted.",

The inputs of the method include the robot mass, the leg and actuator properties, and the desired forward velocity, yielding all robot body feasible trajectories and their energy footprints. Thus, the method predicts the maximum forward velocity of a trotting quadruped; it also suggests energetically optimal combinations of body height and step length for a given forward velocity.",

To achieve a motion which is not explicitly a function of time, the velocity field control is considered in this paper. The proposed new controller consists of a proportional-like feedback term and a neural network (NN) term, where the later is exploited to compensate for the dynamic uncertainties of the system. The AAN property is facilitated by means of a dead-zone function in the feedback control term and a forgetting factor in the adaptation law of NN component. The designed controller guarantees the stability of the system with a bounded control command. The performance of the proposed AAN scheme is validated through the simulation and experiment conducted on a lower-limb exoskeleton.",

        "abstract": "Gas pipeline requires to be inspected regularly for leakages caused by natural disaster. Robots are widely used for pipeline inspection since they are more convenient than manual inspection. Several problems, however, exist due to the restriction by complex pipe networks. The most significant one is limited inspection range caused by restriction of cable length or wireless signal attenuation. In this paper, we proposed a concept of wireless relay communication to assist robot to extend the inspection range, and we newly developed a tracked robot chain system. In this system, each robot serves as a relay communication node. Leakage information of pipes are transmitted via these relay nodes. To ensure the stability of relay communication between adjacent robots, we adopted RSSI (received signal strength indication)-based evaluation method for cooperative and coordinated movement of robot chain system. Moreover, wireless application layer communication protocol (WALCP) was used to increase the stable performance of wireless relay communication. Each robot can self-navigate based on distance measurement module, which enables robots to pass through an elbow junction. Multiple experiments to evaluate relay transmission efficiency, RSSI-based cooperative movement, and comprehensive performance were conducted. Results revealed that our proposed system could realize relatively accurate relay transmission and RSSI-based coordinated movement.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to generate the time-optimal trajectory for a robot manipulator under certain kinematic constraints such as joint position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk limits. This problem of generating a trajectory that takes the minimum time to pass through specified waypoints is formulated as a nonlinear constraint optimization problem. Unlike prior approaches that model the motion of consecutive waypoints as a Cubic Spline, we model this motion with a seven-segment acceleration profile, as this trajectory results in a shorter overall motion time while staying within the bounds of the robot manipulator's constraints. The optimization bottleneck lies in the complexity that increases exponentially with the number of waypoints. To make the optimization scale well with the number of waypoints, we propose an approach that has linear complexity. This approach first divides all waypoints to consecutive batches, each with an overlap of two waypoints. The overlapping waypoints then act as a bridge to concatenate the optimization results of two consecutive batches. The whole trajectory is effectively optimized by successively optimizing every batch. We conduct experiments on practical scenarios and trajectories generated by motion planners to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach over existing state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "abstract": "Social robots able to continually learn facial expressions could progressively improve their emotion recognition capability towards people interacting with them. Semi-supervised learning through ensemble predictions is an efficient strategy to leverage the high exposure of unlabelled facial expressions during human-robot interactions. Traditional ensemble-based systems, however, are composed of several independent classifiers leading to a high degree of redundancy, and unnecessary allocation of computational resources. In this paper, we proposed an ensemble based on convolutional networks where the early layers are strong low-level feature extractors, and their representations shared with an ensemble of convolutional branches. This results in a significant drop in redundancy of low-level features processing. Training in a semi-supervised setting, we show that our approach is able to continually learn facial expressions through ensemble predictions using unlabelled samples from different data distributions.",

        "abstract": "To enable robots to work on real home environments, they have to not only consider common knowledge in the global society, but also be aware of existing rules there. Since such \u201clocal rules\u201d are not describable beforehand, robot agents must acquire them through their lives after deployment. To achieve this, we developed a framework that a) lets robots record long-term episodic memories in their deployed environments, b) autonomously builds probabilistic object localization map as structurization of logged data and c) make adapted task plans based on the map. We equipped our framework on PR2 and Fetch robots operating and recording episodic memory for 41 days with semantic common knowledge of the environment. We also conducted demonstrations in which a PR2 robot tidied up a room, showing that the robot agent can successfully plan and execute local-rule-aware home assistive tasks by using our proposed framework.",

Despite the latest advances in robotic technologies, virtually no robots are able to cope with the specificities of the \u201cmodus vivendi\u201d of different cultures. We start by proposing Bayesian classifiers to capture unitary attributes of different users, clustering them in a n-dimensional semantic attribute space, aggregating groups of persons that share similar attributes. Results show a highly accurate classification framework, both capable of detecting specific subtleties in user's properties, and generalizing them into representative profiles. We then discuss its application towards adapting the actions of a robot and its potential impact on culture-awareness, demonstrating how the proposed framework can enable culture-awareness, exploring this new frontier in social robotics.",

Since high DoFs grippers are complex to coordinate and overkill for many industrial processes, our approach used an under-actuated parallel gripper with a 3D-printed adaptation to precisely grasp the fan in such a manner that gravity could be leveraged to act on the fan to produce an extrinsic, or external, dexterity. With our approach, we completed the challenge in 12.38 seconds, resulting in a top three finish. Furthermore, using a multi-modal tactile sensor, we analyzed the vibrations in the grasp during the manipulation and were able to distinguish the opening and closing of the fan from the motion of the robot with a 83% accuracy.",

This paper identifies the physical limitations of the modeling methods that do not account for external disturbances, and then analyzes the issues of numerical stability of Model Predictive Control (MPC)using different models with variable receding horizons. We propose a new modeling formulation that can be used for both gait planning and feedback control in an MPC scheme. The advantages are the improved numerical stability for long prediction horizons and the robustness against various disturbances. Benchmarks were rigorously studied to compare the proposed MPC scheme with the existing ones in terms of numerical stability and disturbance rejection. The effectiveness of the controller is demonstrated in both MATLAB and Gazebo simulations.",

To solve the problem, we propose an integrated estimation-control scheme to simultaneously achieve the relative localization and navigation tasks for discrete-time integrators under bounded velocity: a nonlinear adaptive estimation scheme to estimate the relative position to the landmark, and a delicate control scheme to ensure both the convergence of the estimation and the asymptotic docking at the given landmark. A rigorous proof of convergence is provided by invoking the discrete-time LaSalle's invariance principle, and we also validate our theoretical findings on quadcopters equipped with ultra-wideband ranging sensors and optical flow sensors in a GPS-less environment.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces alternative behaviors described by the SLIP model when it is subject to a range of initial conditions. A non-dimensional SLIP model and a numerical return map search scheme are used to determine fixed points as a function of non-dimensional leg stiffness and vertical displacement under friction constraints. A SLIP model behavior analysis is performed, using an analytical stance phase approximation, by diverging from the fixed points, i.e. by increasing/decreasing initial horizontal velocity, and/or touchdown angle. The results show that beyond the regular fixed points, the SLIP model performs an alternative, stable behavior that repeats itself every two cycles of motion. We call these 2nd-order fixed points and the regular ones 1st-order fixed points. A numerical simulation scheme was developed to investigate 2nd-order fixed points for a wide range of horizontal velocities and touchdown angles. Results show that 2nd-order fixed points respecting the friction cone constraints exist that can lead to a number of different behaviors such as high jumps, obstacle avoidance of different heights, or backward motion.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an omnidirectional jumper with expanded locomotion capabilities. The mechanisms for four functions-jumping, steering, self-righting and take-off angle adjustment-are designed using only two motors to maximize the jumping performance. Jumping uses the modified active triggering mechanism with one motor. Steering shares this motor and uses the wheel touching the ground. The take-off angle is adjusted by changing the angle between the body and the foot using another motor. Self-righting is possible by utilizing combinations of the movements that occur in the energy storing and angle adjustment processes. With these four functions, the robot is capable of jumping in all directions and can jump anywhere in between the maximum height and maximum distance. It can also jump multiple times by self-righting. The robot, with a mass of 64.4 g, jumps up to 113 cm in vertical height, and 170 cm in horizontal distance. This robot can be deployed to explore various environments. Moreover, the design method to implement more functions than the number of motors can be applied to design other small-scale robots.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper addresses the optimization-based planning of collision-free motions for a dual-arm robot with kinematic constraints. Such problems arise, for example, when the robot has to move an object with both arms, whereby the two arms and the gripped object form a closed kinematic chain. Such constrained problems are hard to solve with sampling-based planners, because the probability that a random sample satisfies the closure constraint is practically zero. In contrast, the solution of optimization problems with equality constraints is a well-understood field of research. This paper formulates the motion planning task as optimization problem and proposes a numerical solution using the augmented Lagrangian method for handling constraints. The planner is compared to RRTs, CHOMP and TrajOpt on a set of randomly generated problems for a dual-arm robot with twelve degrees of freedom highlighting the advantages of optimization-based planning.",

        "abstract": "Motivated by the desire to have robots physically present in human environments, in recent years we have witnessed an emergence of different approaches for learning active compliance. Some of the most compelling solutions exploit a minimal intervention control principle, correcting deviations from a goal only when necessary, and among those who follow this concept, several probabilistic techniques have stood out from the rest. However, these approaches are prone to requiring several task demonstrations for proper gain estimation and to generating unpredictable robot motions in the face of uncertainty. Here we present a Programming by Demonstration approach for uncertainty-aware impedance regulation, aimed at making the robot compliant - and safe to interact with - when the uncertainty about its predicted actions is high. Moreover, we propose a data-efficient strategy, based on the energy observed during demonstrations, to achieve minimal intervention control, when the uncertainty is low. The approach is validated in an experimental scenario, where a human collaboratively moves an object with a 7-DoF torque-controlled robot.",

This paper proposes a novel intuitive remote handling interface, using a classical hand-held assembly tool as a paradigm. The master device is a portable instrumented tweezers with one active degree of freedom. Its spatial motion, tracked by optical means, controls the slave kinematics while its pinch commands the slave robot's microgripper and provides haptic feedback.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a free-space open-loop dynamic response analysis for an MRI -guided magnetically-actuated steerable intra-vascular catheter system. The catheter tip is embedded with a set of current carrying micro-coils. The catheter is directly actuated via the magnetic torques generated on these coils by the magnetic field of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)scanner. The relationship between the input current commands and catheter tip deflection angle presents an inherent nonlinearity in the proposed catheter system. The system nonlinearity is analyzed by utilizing a pendulum model. The pendulum model is used to describe the system nonlinearity and to perform an approximate input-output linearization. Then, a black-box system identification approach is performed for frequency response analysis of the linearized dynamics. The optimal estimated model is reduced by observing the modes and considering the Nyquist frequency of the camera system that is used to track the catheter motion. The reduced model is experimentally validated with 3D open-loop Cartesian free-space trajectories. This study paves the way for effective and accurate free-space closed-loop control of the robotic catheter with real-time feedback from MRI guidance in subsequent research.",

        "abstract": "Developing analytical models of efficient locomotion in biology is one of the most interesting goals in bio- inspired robotics. This paper presents a mathematical framework in order to model one of the most energy efficient locomotion types in flying animals; i.e., thermal soaring. Unlike the legged locomotion, in flying, modeling the environmental effects on animals' behaviors is very important. In doing so, we develop our model by assuming thermals as bubbles of rising air. According to pieces of real evidence, this kind of modeling is more compatible with the nature of thermal soaring. Moreover, we present a simple hybrid control strategy for obtaining the optimal path in order to maximize benefit from the updraft of air-flow. By using this control strategy, the flying robot can plan a path for traveling between thermals without flapping; i.e., energy efficient flying. So as to investigate the compatibility of presented model and controller with reality, we set their parameters based on the biological evidences. As a result, in simulations, it is observed that the generated flying behavior is comparable with the thermal soaring behavior of real birds. This observation provides a confirmation for generality and applicability of the presented approach.",

The ultimate goal is to minimise the travel distance of DAVs while simultaneously avoid obstacles, and maintain altitude constraints as well as the shape of the UAV formation. A multiple-objective optimisation algorithm, called the Angle-encoded Particle Swarm Optimization (\u03b8- PSO) algorithm, is proposed to accelerate the swarm convergence with angular velocity and position being used for the location of particles. The whole formation is modelled as a virtual rigid body and controlled to maintain a desired geometric shape among the paths created while the centroid of the group follows a pre-determined trajectory. Based on the testbed of 3DR Solo drones equipped with a proprietary Mission Planner, and the Internet-of- Things (loT) for multi-directional transmission and reception of data between the DAV s, extensive experiments have been conducted for triangular formation maintenance along a monorail bridge. The results obtained confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Loss of thrust is a critical situation for human pilots of fixed-wing aircraft which force them to select a landing site in the nearby range and perform an emergency landing. The time for the landing site selection is limited by the actual altitude of the aircraft, and it may be fatal if the correct decision is not chosen fast enough. Therefore, we propose a novel RRT* -based planning algorithm for finding the safest emergency landing trajectory towards a given set of possible landing sites. Multiple landing sites are evaluated simultaneously during the flight even before any mechanical issue occurs, and the roadmap of possible landing trajectories is updated permanently. Thus, the proposed algorithm has the any-time property and provides the best emergency landing trajectory almost instantly.",

        "abstract": "We propose an appearance-based along-route localization algorithm that relies on robust place recognition by matching image sequences instead of individual frames. Our approach extends state of the art place recognition framework SeqSLAM in several aspects to realize real-time localization along routes for autonomous navigation. First, our method is online in that we only rely on the recently observed image frames. Second, we provide a homing mechanism based on rotations computed from frame matches. And third, we use a more flexible mechanism to search for matching locations, not restricting the search to straight lines in the cost matrix as in SeqSLAM, but allowing for a wide variety of route traversal conditions such as varying velocities or rotational and translational viewpoint differences. We investigate different image preprocessing steps as well as image similarity metrics wrt. their influence on illumination and viewpoint invariance for a more robust place recognition. On a new challenging dataset, recorded in real world experiments with a planetary rover, in the course of a Moon-analogue mission on Sicily's Mount Etna, we show the feasibility of our direct, sequence-based approach to along-route localization.",

        "abstract": "Estimating accurate and reliable fruit and vegetable counts from images in real-world settings, such as orchards, is a challenging problem that has received significant recent attention. Estimating fruit counts before harvest provides useful information for logistics planning. While considerable progress has been made toward fruit detection, estimating the actual counts remains challenging. In practice, fruits are often clustered together. Therefore, methods that only detect fruits fail to offer general solutions to estimate accurate fruit counts. Furthermore, in horticultural studies, rather than a single yield estimate, finer information such as the distribution of the number of apples per cluster is desirable. In this work, we formulate fruit counting from images as a multi-class classification problem and solve it by training a Convolutional Neural Network. We first evaluate the per-image accuracy of our method and compare it with a state of the art method based on Gaussian Mixture Models over four test datasets. Even though the parameters of the Gaussian Mixture Model based method are specifically tuned for each dataset, our network outperforms it in three out of four datasets with a maximum of 94% accuracy. Next, we use the method to estimate the yield for two datasets for which we have ground truth. Our method achieved 96-97% accuracies.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Unsupervised learning techniques, such as Bayesian topic models, are capable of discovering latent structure directly from raw data. These unsupervised models can endow robots with the ability to learn from their observations without human supervision, and then use the learned models for tasks such as autonomous exploration, adaptive sampling, or surveillance. This paper extends single-robot topic models to the domain of multiple robots. The main difficulty of this extension lies in achieving and maintaining global consensus among the unsupervised models learned locally by each robot. This is especially challenging for multi-robot teams operating in communication-constrained environments, such as marine robots. We present a novel approach for multi-robot distributed learning in which each robot maintains a local topic model to categorize its observations and model parameters are shared to achieve global consensus. We apply a combinatorial optimization procedure that combines local robot topic distributions into a globally consistent model based on topic similarity, which we find mitigates topic drift when compared to a baseline approach that matches topics na\u00efvely, We evaluate our methods experimentally by demonstrating multi-robot underwater terrain characterization using simulated missions on real seabed imagery. Our proposed method achieves similar model quality under bandwidth-constraints to that achieved by models that continuously communicate, despite requiring less than one percent of the data transmission needed for continuous communication.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Minimally invasive arthroscopic surgery is a very challenging procedure that requires the manipulation of instruments in limited intraarticular space using distorted and sometimes uninformative images. Localizing the arthroscope reliably and at all times w.r.t. surrounding tissue is of fundamental importance to prevent unintended injury to patients. However, even highly-trained surgeons can struggle to localize the arthro-scope using poor image feedback. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate for the first time a visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) system, termed ArthroSLAM, capable of robustly and reliably localizing an arthroscope inside a human knee joint. The proposed system fuses the information obtained from the arthroscope, an external camera mounted on an arthroscope holder, and the odometry of a robotic arm manipulating the scope, in an Extended Kalman Filter framework. Also for the first time, we implement five alternative strategies for localization and compare them to our method in a realistic setup with a human cadaver knee joint. ArthroSLAM is shown to outperform the alternative strategies under various challenging conditions, localizing reliably and at all times with a mean Relative Pose Error of up to 1.4mm and 0.7\u00b0. Additional experiments conducted with degraded odometry data also validate the robustness of the method. An initial evaluation of the sparse map of a knee section computed by our method exhibits good morphological agreement. All results suggest that ArthroSLAM is a viable component for the robotic orthopedic surgical assistant of the future.",

Stiffness and damping are key parameters that characterize the adaptation to perturbations. In this work, by drawing inspirations from controllable compliance and damping in existing soft and bio-inspired legged robots, we propose an approach to design a nonlinear controller for the balancing of humanoid robots with rigid bodies. Existing literature has proposed simplified dynamical models of biped robots in order to predict the timing and placement of swing foot for walking without falling. We further employ the properties of invariance to perturbations in damped harmonic oscillators and formulate continuous feedback control in combination with predictive foot stepping in order to achieve continuous adaptive recoveries of the nominal walking cycle from unexpected physical disturbances. Our method allows asymptotic convergence of the rigid body dynamics to a subspace with the desired energy level. We demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm base on extensive push recovery experiments on a NAO robot on flat terrains.",

The optical sensors provide relative position information between the platform and the asset, which enables human operator inputs to be autonomously adjusted to ensure safe separation. The assisted control approach is designed to reduced operator workload during close proximity inspection tasks, with collision avoidance and safe separation managed autonomously. The energy infrastructure includes single vertical wooden poles and crossarm with attached overhead wires. Simulated and real experimental results are provided.",

        "abstract": "This article presents an approach for assisted teleoperation of a robot arm, formulated within a real-time stack-of-tasks (SoT)whole-body motion control framework. The approach leverages the hierarchical nature of the SoT framework to integrate operator commands with assistive tasks, such as joint limit and obstacle avoidance or automatic gripper alignment. Thereby some aspects of the teleoperation problem are delegated to the controller and carried out autonomously. The key contributions of this work are two-fold: the first is a method for unobtrusive integration of autonomy in a telemanip-ulation system; and the second is a user study evaluation of the proposed system in the context of teleoperated pick-and-place tasks. The proposed approach of assistive control was found to result in higher grasp success rates and shorter trajectories than achieved through manual control, without incurring additional cognitive load to the operator.",

        "abstract": "Associative Skill Memories (ASMs) were formulated to encode stereotypical movements along with their stereotypical sensory events to increase the robustness of underlying dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) against noisy perception and perturbations. In ASMs, the stored sensory trajectories, such as the haptic and tactile measurements, are used to compute how much a perturbed movement deviates from the desired one, and to correct the movement if possible. In our work, we extend ASMs: rather than using stored single sensory trajectory instances, our system generates sensory event models and exploits those models to correct the perturbed movements during executions with the aim of generalizing to novel configurations. In particular, measured force and the torque trajectories are modelled using Parametric Hidden Markov Models, and then reproduced by Gaussian Mixture Regression. With Baxter robot, we demonstrate that our proposed force feedback model can be used to correct a trajectory while pushing an object with a mass never experienced before, and which otherwise slips away from the gripper because of noise. In the end, we discuss how far this skill can be generalized using the force model and possible future improvements.",

The maximum walking speed was about 0.56 mm/s, which is about 2 times faster than other types of bio actuated walker. The maximum atmospheric driven time was over 45 minutes.

        "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks have achieved wide success in RGB saliency detection. Recently, the advent of RGB-D sensors such as Kinect provide additional geometric saliency cues. However, the key challenge for RGB-D salient object detection that how to fuse RGB and depth information sufficiently is still under-studied. Traditional works mainly follow the two-stream architecture and combine RGB and depth features/decisions in an early or late point. The multi-modal fusion stage is performed by directly concatenating the features from two modalities without selection. In this work, we address this question by proposing a novel network with a distinguished insight: A selection module is significantly helpful for more informative and sufficient cross-modal cross-level combination. To this end, we introduce a top-down RGB-D fusion network which integrates an attention-aware cross-modal cross-level fusion block in each level to select discriminative features from each level and each modality. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that the proposed network is able to solve the key problems in RGB-D fusion and achieves state-of-the-art performance on RGB-D salient object detection.",

In outdoor conditions, these systems capture information in which sky regions cover a major segment of the images acquired. However, sky regions are discarded and are not considered as visual cue in vision applications. In this paper, we propose to estimate attitude of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) from sky information using a polarimetric camera. Theoretically, we provide a framework estimating the attitude from the skylight polarized patterns. We showcase this formulation on both simulated and real-word data sets which proved the benefit of using polarimetric sensors along with other visual sensors in robotic applications.",

In this paper, we build such a simulator for two scenarios, planar pushing and ball bouncing, by augmenting an analytical rigid-body simulator with a neural network that learns to model uncertainty as residuals. Combining symbolic, deterministic simulators with learnable, stochastic neural nets provides us with expressiveness, efficiency, and generalizability simultaneously. Our model outperforms both purely analytical and purely learned simulators consistently on real, standard benchmarks. Compared with methods that model uncertainty using Gaussian processes, our model runs much faster, generalizes better to new object shapes, and is able to characterize the complex distribution of object trajectories.",

        "abstract": "Microrobotic cargo delivery possesses promising perspective for precision medicine, and has attracted much attention recently. However, its automation remains challenging, especially with complex environmental conditions, such as obstacles and obstructed optical feedback. In this paper, we propose an automated control approach for a new microrobotic cargo carrier, i. e. the multifunctional magnetic spore (Mag-Spore). By surface functionalization of the spore with Fe3O4 nanoparticles and carbon quantum dots, it can be remotely actuated and tracked by an electromagnetic coil system and the fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Our strategy utilizes fluorescence imaging for vision feedback, which enhances the recognition and tracking of Mag-Spores and cells. Then, information of the cells and Mag-Spores for planning and control is identified via image processing, and an optimal path planner with obstacle avoidance capability is designed based on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)algorithm. To make the Mag-Spore follow the planed path accurately, an observer-based trajectory tracking controller is synthesized. Simulations and experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.",

        "abstract": "We describe a novel approach to image based localisation in urban environments which uses semantic matching between images and a 2-D cartographic map. This contrasts with the majority of existing approaches which use image to image database matching. We use highly compact binary descriptors to represent locations, indicating the presence or not of semantic features, which significantly increases scalability and has the potential for greater invariance to variable imaging conditions. The approach is also more akin to human map reading, making it better suited to human-system interaction. In this initial study we use semantic features relating to buildings and road junctions in discrete viewing directions. CNN classifiers are used to detect the features in images and we match descriptor estimates with location tagged descriptors derived from the 2-D map to give localisation. The descriptors are not sufficiently discriminative on their own, but when concatenated sequentially along a route, their combination becomes highly distinctive and allows localisation even when using non-perfect classifiers. Performance is further improved by taking into account left or right turns over a route. Experimental results obtained using Google StreetView and OpenStreetMap data show that the approach has considerable potential, achieving localisation accuracy of around 85% using routes corresponding to approximately 200 meters.",

        "abstract": "Due to the widespread use of industrial robots in market, its application has extended to welding, painting, and freight handling. And tool coordinate calibration is regularly modified after tool replacement due to collision accident or routine maintenance. After tool replacement, operators often rebuild tool coordinates. This is the traditional mode of operation in the current industrial practices. However, smart factory will make artificial intelligence method replace manual method. This paper presents a system independent method for automatic calibration of the tool coordinate system which is faster, simpler, cheaper and more effective than the manual method. The proposed method required images to be captured using two \u201ceye to hand\u201d cameras and one \u201ceye in hand\u201d camera. Tool position data is then acquired through CamShift and MeanShift algorithm for image trajectory tracking along with coordinate system conversion, several methods like PCA, LDA can deal with the vision data. Optimal Deep Neural Network (DNN) method error compensation of a robot allows the tool to automatically run with the calibration system functions. We have developed a 6 degrees of freedom(DoF) industrial robot for this experiment. Nine different kinds of DNN models are built and finally with suitable tool coordinate error compensation for the current robot, tool calibration can be achieved adaptively and efficiently.",

        "abstract": "One of the major challenges of model predictive control (MPC) for robotic applications is the non-trivial weight tuning process while crafting the objective function. This process is often executed using the trial-and-error method by the user. Consequently, the optimality of the weights and the time required for the process become highly dependent on the skill set and experience of the user. In this study, we present a generic and user-independent framework which automates the tuning process by reinforcement learning. The proposed method shows competency in tuning a nonlinear MPC (NMPC) which is employed for trajectory tracking control of aerial robots. It explores the desirable weights within less than an hour in iterative Gazebo simulations running on a standard desktop computer. The real world experiments illustrate that the NMPC weights explored by the proposed method result in a satisfactory trajectory tracking performance.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of extrinsic calibration of a camera and a 3D Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor using a checkerboard. Unlike previous works which require at least three checkerboard poses, our algorithm reduces the minimal number of poses to one by combining 3D line and plane correspondences. Besides, we prove that parallel planar targets with parallel boundaries provide the same constraints in our algorithm. This allows us to place the checkerboard close to the LiDAR so that the laser points better approximate the target boundary without loss of generality. Moreover, we present an algorithm to estimate the similarity transformation between the LiDAR and the camera for the applications where only the correspondences between laser points and pixels are concerned. Using a similarity transformation can simplify the calibration process since the physical size of the checkerboard is not needed. Meanwhile, estimating the scale can yield a more accurate result due to the inevitable measurement errors of the checkerboard size and the LiDAR intrinsic scale factor that transforms the LiDAR measurement to the metric measurement. Our algorithm is validated through simulations and experiments. Compared to the plane-only algorithms, our algorithm can obtain more accurate result by fewer number of poses. This is beneficial to the large-scale commercial application.",

        "abstract": "Fall risk assessments provide a useful tool to prevent morbidity and mortality provoked by falls. Nowadays, these assessments are usually performed manually by the medical staff. This approach has three main drawbacks: (i) it is time consuming, so it is only performed a few times per volunteer during their rehabilitation process; (ii) it requires supervision by medical staff, so assessment at home or preferred environments is not feasible; and (iii) fall risk is evaluated in a global way, so imminent fall risk is not available for decision making in assistive navigation. In this paper we propose an imminent fall risk estimator for rollator's users that can be automatically obtained on the fly. Its main advantages are: (i) it can be used in everyday conditions in any environment; (ii) it does not require assistance of medical staff; and (iii) it is suitable for a variety of users with minimal configuration changes. We have validated our estimator with a set of volunteers (n=10) presenting different physical and cognitive disabilities. Although the number of volunteer is limited, results show that our estimator is coherent to two traditional, well accepted assessments: the Tinetti Mobility Test and the walking speed.",

Due to their heuristic nature, they are typically configured with several parameters. In this paper we demonstrate that, in many scenarios, the widely used default parameter values are not ideal. However, finding the best parameters to optimise some metric(s) is not trivial because the size of the parameter space can be large. We evaluate and compare the efficiency of four different methods (i.e. random sampling, AUC-Bandit, random forest, and bayesian optimisation) to tune the parameters of two motion planning algorithms, BKPIECE and RRT-connect. We present a table-top-reaching scenario where the seven degrees-of-freedom KUKA LWR robotic arm has to move from an initial to a goal pose in the presence of several objects in the environment. We show that the best methods for BKPIECE (AUC-Bandit) and RRT-Connect (random forest) improve the performance by 4.5x and 1.26x on average respectively. Then, we generate a set of random scenarios of increasing complexity, and we observe that optimal parameters found in simple environments perform well in more complex scenarios. Finally, we find that the time required to evaluate parameter configurations can be reduced by more than 2/3 with low error. Overall, our results demonstrate that for a variety of motion planning problems it is possible to find solutions that significantly improve the performance over default configurations while requiring very reasonable computation times.",

However, the use of sensor combinations for a raw material characterization in mining is very limited and automation of the material identification process using a combined sensor signal is not defined. Potential sensor technologies for raw material characterization were evaluated based on the applicability and technological maturity. To ensure a rapid implementation of the Real-time mining (RTM) project concept, mature technologies such as Red Green Blue (RGB) imaging, Visible Near Infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral imaging, Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral imaging, Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) and Raman were selected. Each selected technology was assessed for automation in sensing and applicability (for characterization of the test case materials). Based on the results the sensor data were further considered for data fusion. The proposed sensor combinations approach encompasses three levels of data fusion: low-level, mid-level and high-level. The data of the different sensors are fused together in order to acquire a wide range of mineral properties within each lithotype and an improved classification and predictive models. The preferred level of data fusion and preferred sensor data combinations will be used to develop a multi-variate statistical interpretation rule which relates combination of sensors signals with raw material properties. Thus a tool which integrates the combined sensor signal with materials properties will be developed and used to automate the material characterization process.",

        "abstract": "Behavior trees (BT) are a popular control architecture in the computer game industry, and have been more recently applied in robotics. One open question is how can intelligent agents/robots autonomously acquire their behavior trees for task level control? In contrast with existing approaches that either refine an initially given BT, or directly build the BT based on human feedback/demonstration, we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) that allows robots to autonomously learn control policies by repeated task interaction, but often expressed in a language more difficult to interpret than BTs. The learned control policy is then converted to a behavior tree via our proposed decanonicalization algorithm. The feasibility of this idea is based on a proposed notion of canonical behavior trees (CBT). In particular, we show (1) CBTs are sufficiently expressive to capture RL control policies, and (2) that RL can be independent of an optimal behavior permutation, despite the BT convention of left-to-right priority, thus obviating the need for a combinatorial search. Two evaluation domains help illustrate our approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an autonomous perching concept for multirotor aerial vehicles. The Autonomous Grasping Robotic Aerial System for Perching (AGRASP)represents a novel integration of robotics perception, vision-based path planning, and biomimetically-inspired manipulation on a small, lightweight aerial robot with highly-constrained sensor and processing capacity. Computationally lightweight perception algorithms pull candidate perch structures out of a complex environment with no a priori knowledge of the operational space. The innovative manipulator design combines both active grasp and passive grip enabling it to maintain hold on the perch even with all power off. We experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, a quadrotor autonomously detecting and landing on a perch relying solely on onboard sensing and processing.",

        "abstract": "Capsule endoscopes have gained popularity over the last decade as minimally invasive devices for diagnosing gastrointestinal abnormalities such as colorectal cancer. While this technology offers a less invasive and more convenient alternative to traditional scopes, these capsules are only able to provide observational capabilities due to their passive nature. With the addition of a reliable mobility system and a real-time navigation system, capsule endoscopes could transform from observational devices into active surgical tools, offering biopsy and therapeutic capabilities and even autonomous navigation in a single minimally invasive device. In this work, a vision system is developed to allow for autonomous lumen center tracking and haustral fold identification and tracking during colonoscopy. This system is tested for its ability to accurately identify and track multiple haustral folds across many frames in both simulated and in vivo video, and the lumen center tracking is tested onboard a robotic endoscope platform (REP) within an active simulator to demonstrate autonomous navigation. In addition, real-time localization is demonstrated using open source ORB-SLAM2. The vision system successfully identified 95.6% of Haustral folds in simulator frames and 70.6% in in vivo frames and false positives occurred in less than 1% of frames. The center tracking algorithm showed in vivo center estimates within a mean error of 6.6% of physician estimates and allowed for the REP to traverse 2 m of the active simulator in 6 minutes without intervention.",

        "abstract": "In a human-robot interaction, a robot needs to move to a position where the robot can obtain high reliability data of people, such as positions, postures, and voice. This is because the human recognition reliability depends on the positional relation between the people and the robot. In addition, the robot should choose the sensor data which is necessary to perform the interaction task. Therefore, it is necessary to navigate the robot to the position to obtain the data for initiation of the interaction task. Accordingly, we need to design a path-planning method considering sensor characteristics, human recognition reliability, and task contents. Although previous studies proposed path-planning methods using an interaction potential considering sensor characteristics, they did not consider the task contents and the human recognition reliability, which are important for practical application and did not applied to interaction with multiple people. Consequently, we present a path-planning method considering the task contents and the human recognition reliability using multimodal potential field integrating these information. We verified effectiveness of the path-planning method for interaction with multiple people.",

        "abstract": "With the increase in developments in underwater infrastructure, the demand for development of autonomous vehicle navigation system in structured environment is also increased. However, the localization in a structured environment is a challenging problem due to signal uncertainties and distortions. In order to overcome these problems, we propose the camera and sonar aided integrated navigation system. In the proposed sensor-fusion-based localization scheme, the AUV estimates its own position continuously using artificial landmarks. The artificial landmarks for image sonar is deployed along the path to guide the AUV to the structure. The active vision markers are installed on the jacket structure, and they function as both landmarks and waypoints. This approach prevents the inherent drift of dead-reckoning velocities and collision with structures. The proposed approach was verified through a real sea experiment. The AUV conducted the full autonomous navigation from the dock to the jacket structure, and then returned to the dock without collision or significant localization error. These results show the feasibility of full autonomous navigation in a structured environment.",

We build a generalized kinematic model that enables the design of RAE-patterned actuators and reveal the distinct auxetic behavior of RAE actuators with comparable model accuracy to the legacy McKibben actuators. A simple, reproducible way of designing and fabricating RAE actuators is described and varied prototypes are shown. This RAE-based design scheme can be used to create actuators with specified kinematics like bending, extension, and radial expansion, which can also vary across the actuator's surface both circumferentially and axially in a tractable, scalable manner.",

We report on preliminary results collected from a study that attempts to measure how the actions of a participant may be altered by empathy for a robot companion. Our findings suggest that induced empathy can in fact have a significant impact on a person's behavior to the extent that the ability to fulfill a mission may be affected.",

        "abstract": "Typical inference approaches that work with high-dimensional visual measurements use hand-engineered image features (e.g, SIFT) that require combinatorial data association, or predict only hidden state mean without considering its uncertainty and multi-modality aspects. We develop a novel approach to infer system hidden state from visual observations via CNN features which are outputs of a CNN classifier. To that end, at pre-deployment stage we use neural networks to learn a generative viewpoint-dependent model of CNN features given the robot pose and approximate this model by a spatially-varying Gaussian distribution. Further, at deployment this model is utilized within a Bayesian framework for probabilistic inference, considering a robot localization problem. Our method does not involve data association and provides uncertainty covariance of the final estimation. Moreover, we show empirically that the CNN feature likelihood is unimodal which simplifies the inference task. We test our method in a simulated Unreal Engine environment, where we succeed to retrieve high-level state information from CNN features and produce trajectory estimation with high accuracy. Additionally, we analyze robustness of our approach to different light conditions.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method for generating the trajectory of a robot assisting a human in servicing a set of tasks embedded in a convex 2-D domain. This method makes use of Bayesian inference to predict human intent in task selection. Rather than following optimal trajectory towards a single task, the robot computes a set of potentially optimal tasks each weighted by the human's posterior probability and superimposes them into a cost function that is designed to minimize the weighted Euclidean distance relative to set. The effect is a flexible path human-robot collaborative network that is shown in simulation to complete all tasks in a given domain in less time than existing methods for a certain class of highly impulsive humans, i.e., humans that tend to randomly switch tasks at times generated by a Poisson counting process. The algorithm is also illustrated through an experimental demonstration.",

The latter is realized by using dedicated motor controllers, which allow to invert the propellers' direction of rotation during flight (so-called 3D mode), and almost or fully symmetric propellers. We present a unified modeling, controller design, and control allocation approach that accounts for bidirectional thrust. Suitable propellers with the ability to produce thrust and torque in both directions are compared and their parameters are identified through a static thrust test. Furthermore, we discuss applications of bidirectional thrust, like inverted flight or surface slip reduction, which are impossible to realize with common unidirectional thrust vehicles. We generate suitable flight trajectories and evaluate our unified approach in experiments with a custom-built quadrotor.",

Rather than utilizing one arm as a fixture for holding one of the parts while the other performs the assembly, motion generation in the relative end-effector frame is proposed that involves both arms. The proposed approach considers bimanual motion in a dynamic and uncertain environment addressing avoidance of collision with obstacles as well as the robot itself and the environment. Moreover, configurations that optimize the motion and force capabilities for the sucessful and efficient completion of the task are taken into account. A task priority strategy is adopted achieving online performance.

A spring-mass model is identified from the kinematics and compliance of the robot. The spring stiffness and damping are encapsulated by the leg length, thus actuating the leg length can create and control hopping behaviors. Trajectory optimization via direct collocation is performed on the spring-mass model to plan jumping and landing motions. The leg length trajectories are utilized as desired outputs to synthesize a control Lyapunov function based quadratic program (CLF-QP). Centroidal angular momentum, taking as an addition output in the CLF-QP, is also stabilized in the jumping phase to prevent whole body rotation in the underactuated flight phase. The solution to the CLF-QP is a nonlinear feedback control law that achieves dynamic jumping behaviors on bipedal robots with compliance. The framework presented in this paper is verified experimentally on the bipedal robot Cassie.",

The design of the robot is optimized to be light weight and compact such that it could be mounted to the patient body. It has a modular design that can be adopted for assisting various image-guided, needle-based percutaneous interventions such as arthrography, biopsy and brachytherapy seed placement. The robot mechanism and the control system are designed and manufactured with components compatible with imaging modalities including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT). The current version of the robot presented in this paper is optimized for shoulder arthrography under MRI guidance; a Z-shaped fiducial frame is attached to the robot, providing accurate and repeatable robot registration with the MR scanner coordinate system. Here we present the mechanical design of the manipulator, robot kinematics, robot calibration procedure, and preliminary bench-top accuracy assessment. The bench-top accuracy evaluation of the robotic manipulator shows average translational error of 1.01 mm and 0.96 mm in X and Z axes, respectively, and average rotational error of 3.06 degrees and 2.07 degrees about the X and Z axes, respectively.",

        "abstract": "The ability to build models of the environment is an essential prerequisite for many robotic applications. In recent years, mapping of dense surface geometry using RGB-D cameras has seen extensive progress. Many approaches build colored models, typically directly using the intensity values provided by the camera. Unfortunately, these intensities are inherently affected by illumination. Therefore, the resulting maps only represent the environment for one specific lighting condition. To overcome this limitation, we propose to build reflectance maps that are invariant against changes in lighting. Our approach estimates the diffuse reflectance of a surface by recovering its radiosity and the corresponding irradiance. As imperfections in this process can significantly degrade the reflectance estimate, we remove outliers in the high dynamic range radiosity estimation and propose a method to refine the reflectance estimate. Our system implements the whole pipeline for offline reconstruction of dense reflectance maps including the segmentation of light emitters in the scene. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach in real-world experiments under varying lighting conditions.",

There is a core tension in Multi-Policy Decision Making (MPDM)systems - it is desirable to add more policies to the system for flexibility in finding good policies, however, this increases computational cost. As a result, MPDM was limited to small (perhaps 5-10)discrete policies - a significant performance bottleneck. In this paper, we radically enhance the expressivity of MPDM by allowing policies to have continuous-valued parameters, while simultaneously satisfying real-time constraints by quickly discovering promising policy parameters through a novel iterative gradient-based algorithm. Our evaluation includes results from extensive simulation and real-world experiments in semi-crowded environments.",

        "abstract": "In many applications, maintaining a consistent dense map of the environment is key to enabling robotic platforms to perform higher level decision making. Several works have addressed the challenge of creating precise dense 3D maps from visual sensors providing depth information. However, during operation over longer missions, reconstructions can easily become inconsistent due to accumulated camera tracking error and delayed loop closure. Without explicitly addressing the problem of map consistency, recovery from such distortions tends to be difficult. We present a novel system for dense 3D mapping which addresses the challenge of building consistent maps while dealing with scalability. Central to our approach is the representation of the environment as a collection of overlapping Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF) subvolumes. These subvolumes are localized through feature-based camera tracking and bundle adjustment. Our main contribution is a pipeline for identifying stable regions in the map, and to fuse the contributing subvolumes. This approach allows us to reduce map growth while still maintaining consistency. We demonstrate the proposed system on a publicly available dataset and simulation engine, and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach for building consistent and scalable maps. Finally we demonstrate our approach running in real-time onboard a lightweight Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV).",

        "abstract": "There have been several attempts at modeling context in robots. However, either these attempts assume a fixed number of contexts or use a rule-based approach to determine when to increment the number of contexts. In this paper, we pose the task of when to increment as a learning problem, which we solve using a Recurrent Neural Network. We show that the network successfully (with 98% testing accuracy) learns to predict when to increment, and demonstrate, in a scene modeling problem (where the correct number of contexts is not known), that the robot increments the number of contexts in an expected manner (i.e., the entropy of the system is reduced). We also present how the incremental model can be used for various scene reasoning tasks.",

To reduce the number of required actuators, a differential coupling mechanism for underactuated fingers was developed, along with a new mechanism that uses variable stiffness actuation in order to increase the workspace of underactuated fingers. The hands provide a research platform for both hand-in-hand and robotic grasping. Design aspects are discussed, and an initial experimental validation verifies the hands' performance.",

Though scientists do not yet agree on the neural architecture involved in both types and in the transition from one to the other, the importance of having robot controllers able to behave rhythmically and discretely is universally recoanized. In this paper, a bio-inspired robot controller based on oscillating neurons is proposed to realize both discrete and rhythmic movements and easily transition from one to the other. It is shown that, under certain parameter conditions, the CPG controller behaves like a PID controller. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of controlling both discrete and rhythmic movements, the CPG is applied to the initiation of handshaking, namely, reach towards the human hand and start to shake it. Results show that this architecture is suitable for both discrete and rhythmic movements and can easily transition from one to the other.",

        "abstract": "We tackle the transition feasibility problem, that is the issue of determining whether there exists a feasible motion connecting two configurations of a legged robot. To achieve this we introduce CROC, a novel method for computing centroidal dynamics trajectories in multi-contact planning contexts. Our approach is based on a conservative and convex reformulation of the problem, where we represent the center of mass trajectory as a Bezier curve comprising a single free control point as a variable. Under this formulation, the transition problem is solved efficiently with a Linear Program (LP)of low dimension. We use this LP as a feasibility criterion, incorporated in a sampling-based contact planner, to discard efficiently unfeasible contact plans. We are thus able to produce robust contact sequences, likely to define feasible motion synthesis problems. We illustrate this application on various multi-contact scenarios featuring HRP2 and HyQ. We also show that we can use CROC to compute valuable initial guesses, used to warm-start non-linear solvers for motion generation methods. This method could also be used for the 0 and 1-Step capturability problem. The source code of CROC is available under an open source BSD-2 License.",

Real-time frameworks are of paramount importance to build a robotic society where humans and robots integrate seamlessly. To this end, we present a novel real-time structure prediction framework that predicts depth at 30 frames per second on an NVIDIA-TX2. At the time of writing, this is the first piece of work to showcase such a capability on a mobile platform.

        "abstract": "Neuroplastic changes in motor cortex is essential for the recovery motor function of patients with neurological diseases. To enlarge neuroplastic change, various movements should be provided to stimulate larger motor cortical area, and because hands occupy the largest area, it is especially important. Many wearable robotic devices have been developed for rehabilitation of the hand, and soft robotic devices in particular have drawn attention for their compact design. However, most soft devices provide simple thumb motions, which flex or extend all joints without assistance of opposition/reposition of the carpometacarpal joint although the importance in producing various grasps. In this study, the design of a cable actuated dexterous (CADEX) glove is proposed. For dexterous motion, the structure and orientation of major finger tendons were replicated with exotendons (actuated cables), and four exotendons were used for the thumb with the path optimized to provide flexion/extension of the thumb and decoupled opposition/reposition of the carpometacarpal with other joints. To provide consistent motion, silicon was used for stable anchoring of exotendons while preventing slippage and reducing deformation. The motion generated by the CADEX glove was experimentally evaluated for a single healthy subject. The result shows that the CADEX glove could flex and extend the finger with various ratios among joints, and the opposition/reposition of carpometacarpal joint of the thumb could be achieved consistently with minimal effect on the other joints. The CADEX glove is expected to help providing various tasks which is expected to enhance the functional recovery of patients with neurological disease.",

The key element of Capler-Leg is its single-stage cable-pulley transmission combined with a high-gap radius motor. Our cable-pulley system is designed to be as light-weight as possible and to additionally serve as the primary cooling element, thus significantly increasing the power density and efficiency of the overall system. The total weight of active elements on the leg, i.e. the stators and the rotors, contribute more than 60 % of the total leg weight, which is an order of magnitude higher than most existing robots. The resulting robotic leg has low inertia, high torque transparency, low manufacturing cost, no backlash, and a low number of parts. The Capler-Leg system itself, serves as an experimental setup for evaluating the proposed cable-pulley design in terms of robustness and efficiency. A continuous jump experiment shows a remarkable 96.5 % recuperation rate, measured at the battery output. This means that almost all the mechanical energy output during push-off is returned back to the battery during touch-down.",

        "abstract": "3D LiDARs and 2D cameras are increasingly being used alongside each other in sensor rigs for perception tasks. Before these sensors can be used to gather meaningful data, however, their extrinsics (and intrinsics) need to be accurately calibrated, as the performance of the sensor rig is extremely sensitive to these calibration parameters. A vast majority of existing calibration techniques require significant amounts of data and/or calibration targets and human effort, severely impacting their applicability in large-scale production systems. We address this gap with CalibNet: a geometrically supervised deep network capable of automatically estimating the 6-DoF rigid body transformation between a 3D LiDAR and a 2D camera in real-time. CalibNet alleviates the need for calibration targets, thereby resulting in significant savings in calibration efforts. During training, the network only takes as input a LiDAR point cloud, the corresponding monocular image, and the camera calibration matrix K. At train time, we do not impose direct supervision (i.e., we do not directly regress to the calibration parameters, for example). Instead, we train the network to predict calibration parameters that maximize the geometric and photometric consistency of the input images and point clouds. CalibNet learns to iteratively solve the underlying geometric problem and accurately predicts extrinsic calibration parameters for a wide range of mis-calibrations, without requiring retraining or domain adaptation.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a method for contactless material detection with capacitive proximity sensing skins. Our new approach extends the current state-of-the-art proximity and distance sensing methods and measures the characteristic impedance spectrum of an object to obtain material properties. By this, we gain further material information besides of the near field information in a contactless and non-destructive way. The measurement method requires sensors that provide absolute distance and frequency based capacitance measurement capabilities and can be applied to similar systems. The sensor system described in this paper measures proximity with a capacitance based sensor and absolute distance based on time-of-flight (ToF)sensors. Attached on a robot, we gain information about the robot's near field environment. The information is important not only for human- machine- interaction, but also for grasping and manipulation. We focus on signal processing and evaluate our method with measurements of numerous different materials and present a solution to differentiate between them.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for tracking multiple interacting deformable objects undergoing rigid motions, elastic deformations and contacts, using image and point cloud data provided by an RGB-D sensor. A joint registration frame-work is proposed, based on physical Finite Element Method (FEM) elastic and interaction models. It first relies on a visual segmentation of the considered objects in the RGB images. The different segmented point clouds are then processed to estimate rigid transformations with on an ICP algorithm, and to determine geometrical point-to-point correspondences with the meshes. External forces resulting from these correspondences and between the current and the rigidly transformed mesh can then be derived. It provides both non-rigid and rigid data cues. A classical collision detection and response model is also integrated, giving contact forces between the objects. The deformations of the objects are estimated by solving a dynamic system balancing these external and contact forces with the internal or regularization forces computed through the FEM elastic model. This approach has been here tested on different scenarios involving two or three interacting deformable objects of various shapes, with promising results.",

        "abstract": "The quasi-static catenary curve of a semi-slack tether between an essentially stationary unmanned air vehicle (UAV) and a small unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is investigated and characterized. An empirical analysis, performed over a discretized space of vertical and horizontal separations of the two vehicles, determines an optimum cable length & tension for maximizing system robustness during the vertical heave of the USV due to high seas. Operating at this optimum condition allows for equal displacements of the USV in the up and down directions, minimizing the possibility of both fouling (with the tether touching the water) and excessive downforce on the UAV (with the tether pulled taut) during dynamic heave events. Scaling the horizontal offset, tether length, and tension by the flying height collapses all empirical results into convenient curves depending only on a nondimensional relative position parameter (\u0394x/\u0394y), accurately fit by low order polynomials. This eliminates the need for a lookup table, and decreases computation time during implementation. The heave robustness analysis results in a recommended operating relative position of \u0394x/\u0394y \u2248 .46. Experimental results are presented and confirm the catenary analysis for the proposed tether.",

Validating experiments were performed on a benchtop setup, and the results are in agreement with the proposed models.

The design of the exoskeleton is based on the utilization of the center of gravity transition through the user's upper body motion. The passive exoskeleton powered by gas springs allows the user to realize a natural-like posture transition by the user's voluntary upper body motion. We designed the posture transition model such that the user can realize the posture transition in a natural manner based on a minimum jerk criterion. The proposed design aims to permit toilet usage without transferring seating positions between the exoskeleton and toilet seat. Furthermore, the developed mechanism can be integrated with a regular wheelchair, which would allow users to have locomotion capability. We believe that the design can improve children's self-reliant social activities by supporting their voluntary posture transition and toilet use. In this paper, we describe the detailed design process of the exoskeleton and preliminary experiments to investigate its effectiveness through evaluation with a healthy participant.",

As a case study we observe the ability of a group of non-holonomic robots to form robust, self-healing circle formations in a decentralized manner using only a limited frontal binary sensor. We present a grid-search method to find suitable parameters that promote the formation of a stable circle. We then examine how the parameters of the controllers affect the appearance of the behaviour, and provide theoretical proof for its emergence and self-healing properties. We validate the proposed model through a set of experiments with ten mobile real robots. Our results with real robots match the simulated experiments and provide insights on how a simple, computation-free behaviour can generate complex spatio-temporal dynamics.",

        "abstract": "Road networks in cities are massive and is a critical component of mobility. Fast response to defects, that can occur not only due to regular wear and tear but also because of extreme events like storms, is essential. Hence there is a need for an automated system that is quick, scalable and cost-effective for gathering information about defects. We propose a system for city-scale road audit, using some of the most recent developments in deep learning and semantic segmentation. For building and benchmarking the system, we curated a dataset which has annotations required for road defects. However, many of the labels required for road audit have high ambiguity which we overcome by proposing a label hierarchy. We also propose a multi-step deep learning model that segments the road, subdivide the road further into defects, tags the frame for each defect and finally localizes the defects on a map gathered using GPS. We analyze and evaluate the models on image tagging as well as segmentation at different levels of the label hierarchy.",

A system that predicts user's level of susceptibility from their electroencephalography (EEG) signals can be helpful in clinical hypnotherapy sessions. In this paper, we extracted differential entropy (DE) of the recorded EEGs from two groups of subjects with high and low hypnotic susceptibility and built a support vector machine on these DE features for the classification of susceptibility trait. Moreover, we proposed a clustering-based feature refinement strategy to improve the estimation of such trait. Results showed a high classification performance in detection of subjects' level of susceptibility before and during hypnosis.

The knowledge of the garment category is crucial for its robotic manipulation. Our work focuses particularly on garments being held in a hanging state by a robotic arm. The input of our method is a set of depth maps taken from different viewpoints around the garment. The depths are fused into a single 3D point cloud. The cloud is fed into a convolutional neural network that transforms it into a single global feature vector. The network utilizes a generalized convolution operation defined over the local neighborhood of a point. It can deal with permutations of the input points. It was trained on a large dataset of common 3D objects. The extracted feature vector is classified with SVM trained on smaller datasets of garments. The proposed method was evaluated on publicly available data and compared to the original methods, achieving competitive performance and better generalization capability.",

        "abstract": "Many agricultural tasks are known to be dangerous for human operators, the environment, and human health in general. The increasing pressure both on safety and on production levels motivates the development of new methodologies and technologies. The rising of off-road mobile robots for agricultural application appears to be a promising contribution to required innovations. It both permits to limit the exposure of people to hazardous products and to achieve difficult and repetitive tasks. Nevertheless, to be fully efficient, autonomous robots have to ensure a high level of accuracy, while carrying potentially heavy tools, possibly in harsh conditions. It is especially the case of spraying, for which accuracy is a key challenge for reducing environmental impacts. The use of huge robots for spraying might seem to be a straightforward solution, by simply automating existing machines. Nevertheless, a simple automation does not reduce directly the environmental impact of human activities (soil compaction, energy, reduction of the use of chemical products). Moreover, huge machines are not necessarily an advantage when considering safety aspects (rollover risk and maneuverability). As a result, a solution based on the cooperation of at least two mobile robots, moving from either side of a vine row, is investigated in this paper thanks to Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology.",

Experimental results using both synthetic images and acquired images using catadioptric cameras with different scenarios show the effectiveness of our approach.",

While automated planning is able to decompose a complex task into a sequence of steps which reaches an intended goal, it is difficult to formulate such a goal without knowing the internals of the planning system and the exact capabilities of the robot. This becomes even more important in dynamic environments in which manipulable objects are subject to change. In this paper, we present an adaptive control interface which allows users to specify goals based on an internal world model by incrementally building referring expressions to the objects in the world. We consider fetch-and-carry tasks and automatically deduce potential high-level goals from the world model to make them available to the user. Based on its perceptions our system can react to changes in the environment by adapting the goal formulation within the domain-independent planning system.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Accurate localization is critical for a robotic vehicle to navigate autonomously. Conventional autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV s) typically rely on an inertial navigation system (INS) aided by a Doppler velocity log (DVL) in order to reduce the rate of positional error growth of dead-reckoning to a level suitable for reliable navigation underwater. The size, cost, and power requirements of these systems result in vehicles that are prohibitively large and expensive for multi-AUV operations. In this work we present the first results of closed-loop experiments using a miniature, low-cost SandShark AUV and a custom-designed, inexpensive acoustic system first described in our previous work. Results are validated using an independent LBL system, and indicate that our approach is suitably accurate to enable the self-localization of such AUVs without the use of an expensive DVL-aided INS. Self-localization is performed by obtaining acoustic range and angle measurements from the AUV to a single acoustic beacon using a vehicle-mounted passive hydrophone receiver-array, and fusing these measurements using a particle filter. A critical aspect of our approach that allows for real-time, closed-loop operation is the close coupling of conventional phased-array beamforming and particle filtering - this implementation detail reduces the computational complexity associated with our previously described two-stage beamforming plus particle filtering process, and consequently also enables an increase in particle count and an improvement in navigational accuracy. Experimental results are provided for two cases: first, absolute navigation in the case where the beacon is fixed at a known position; and second, relative navigation with a moving beacon, a novel operating paradigm for AUVs which promises to enable multi-AUV operations while maintaining bounded navigation error.",

        "abstract": "Coiled actuators made from polymer fibers are fast becoming popular due to their low-cost and ease of fabrication. Unfortunately, reliable real-time temperature measurement has been frustrated by the small fiber diameter of typical actuators. By using coiled polymer fibers wrapped with a metal wire, we demonstrate the ability to concurrently drive a muscle by electrothermal heating, and monitor muscle temperature through the wire resistance. This simple method enables convenient overheat protection for these muscles, as well as the possibility for closed-loop temperature control. Using this platform, we demonstrate a nested controller using temperature and position feedback to improve contraction speed, and investigate the cooling rates of various configurations that increase total force output.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores ethical and legal implications arising from the intertwinement of cloud services, healthcare and robotics. It closes an existing gap in the literature by highlighting the distinctive ethical and legal concerns associated with the inter-dependence of the cyber- and the physical aspects of healthcare cloud robotics. The identified core concerns include uncertainties with regard to data protection requirements; distributed responsibilities for unintended harm; achievement of transparency and consent for cloud robot services especially for vulnerable robot users; secondary uses of cloud data derived from robot activities; data security; and wider social issues. The paper aims to raise awareness and stimulate reflection of the legal and ethical impacts on different stakeholders arising from the use of cloud services in healthcare robotics. We show that due to the complexity of these concerns the design and implementation of such robots in healthcare requires an interdisciplinary development and impact assessment process. In light of legal requirements and ethical responsibilities towards end-users and other stakeholders, we draw practical considerations for engineers developing cloud services for robots in healthcare.",

        "abstract": "With the advancements in robotic technology and the progress in human-robot interaction research, the interest in deploying mixed human-robot teams in rescue missions is increasing. Due to their complementary capabilities in terms of locomotion, visibility and reachability of areas, human-robot teams are considerably deployed in real-world settings, albeit the robotic agents in such scenarios are normally fully teleoperated. A major barrier to successful and efficient mission execution in those teams is the lack of cognitive skills in robotic systems. In this paper, we present a cognition-enabled framework and an implemented system where robotic agents are equipped with cognitive capabilities to naturally communicate with humans and autonomously perform tasks. The framework allows for natural tasking of robots, reasoning about robot behavior, capabilities and actions, and a common belief state representation for shared mission awareness of robots and human operators.",

        "abstract": "Driving is a social activity: drivers often indicate their intent to change lanes via motion cues. We consider mixed-autonomy traffic where a Human-driven Vehicle (HV) and an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) drive together. We propose a planning framework where the degree to which the AV considers the other agent's reward is controlled by a selfishness factor. We test our approach on a simulated two-lane highway where the AV and HV merge into each other's lanes. In a user study with 21 subjects and 6 different selfishness factors, we found that our planning approach was sound and that both agents had less merging times when a factor that balances the rewards for the two agents was chosen. Our results on double lane merging suggest it to be a non-zero-sum game and encourage further investigation on collaborative decision making algorithms for mixed-autonomy traffic.",

        "abstract": "We use multiple spinning micro-rafts at the air-water interface as mobile microrobot collectives and present here their collective behaviors, including navigating around anchored obstacles, and trapping and transporting floating objects. The 3D-printed micro-rafts are circular disKS of 100 \u03bcm in diameter and have parametrically defined undulating edge profile. The study of their local interactions, manifested by the pairwise interactions between micro-rafts, reveals competing magnetic and capillary interactions that keep the collectives in their dynamic state. Using collectives of 7, 19, and 36 micro-rafts and micro-channels between millimeter-sized posts, we demonstrate the effects of the size of the collectives, the size of the obstacles, and maneuver strategies on the collective navigation. Employing methods from information theory, we show that the pairwise mutual information of the collectives increases significantly during the channel-crossing as a result of the additional constraints of the channel walls on the collectives. Finally, we demonstrate the trapping of 1-mm-diameter polystyrene bead and the trapping and transporting of 600~\u03bcm-wide pm.",

        "abstract": "This paper is a preliminary exploration of how to solve the dual-manipulator path-planning problem from an energy perspective. A virtual spring is set up between the two manipulator bodies and becomes compressed as they move into the area of danger, thus producing elastic potential energy. The initial paths of the manipulators are modelled as two ends-fixed elastic ropes. The elastic potential energy stored in the virtual spring is distributed between the two elastic ropes in a certain proportion so as to deform them. In this way, the original paths of the two manipulators will deviate toward the direction of their respective bases thereby avoiding any collision crisis that may potentially occur. When the dual-manipulator moves away from the danger area, the elastic potential energy caused by the deviation of the elastic ropes will be converted back into energy stored by the virtual spring, such that the elastic ropes revert to their original state and drive the manipulators back to their initial paths. Simple but representative simulations are established and results of the simulations show the reliability of our proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Motion planning for manipulators under task space constraints is difficult as it constrains the joint configurations to always lie on an implicitly defined manifold. It is possible to view task constrained motion planning as an optimization problem with non-linear equality constraints, which can be solved by general non-linear optimization techniques. In this paper, we present a novel custom optimizer which exploits the underlying structure present in many task constraints. At the core of our approach are some simple reformulations, which when coupled with the method of alternating projection, leads to an efficient convex optimization based routine for computing a feasible solution to the task constraints. We subsequently build on this result and use the concept of Augmented Lagrangian to guide the feasible solutions towards those that also minimize the user defined cost function. We show that the proposed optimizer is fully distributive and thus, can be easily parallelized. We validate our formulation on some common robotic benchmark problems. In particular, we show that the proposed optimizer achieves cyclic motion in the joint space corresponding to a similar nature trajectory in the task space. Furthermore, as a baseline, we compare the proposed optimizer with an off-the-shelf non-linear solver provide in open source package SciPy. We show that for similar task constraint residuals and smoothness cost, it can be upto more than three times faster than the SciPy alternative.",

This approach is based on the previously proposed two-stage algorithm that alternates between local and global decision making for efficient topological mapping based on bubble space representation. Differing from it, the approach aims to identify vantage viewpoints with characterizing views for subsequent appearance-based learning as well as achieving complete coverage. This is demonstrated by a series of experiments using an outdoor benchmark data set including a comparative study with evaluation metrics including the exploration path length and number of canonical appearances discovered.",

        "abstract": "3D reconstruction and surgical tool segmentation are necessary for several advanced tasks in robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery. These tasks include vision-based force estimation, surgical guidance, and medical image registration where pre-operative data (CT or MRI scan image slices) are overlaid on patient anatomy in real-time during surgery [1] to name a few. In this work, two main strategies were considered: (1) initialize with surgical tool segmentation from 2D images, then proceed to local 3D reconstruction near the tool-tissue interaction region by projecting the segmented result into 3D space, and (2) initialize with 3D reconstruction of the entire surgical task space, followed by surgical tool segmentation from within the 3D reconstructed model. Both methods were implemented on the Raven II surgical robot system, and accuracy and time complexity for both methods were comparatively analyzed while considering various task parameters. Finally, based on the results of this work, guidelines for selecting reconstruction and segmentation strategies and procedure for particular situations are outlined in Section V.",

This article compares their performance in terms of accuracy, computation time, and memory consumption. Four classical approaches are available to calculate the electric field. Their performances are analyzed in the paper. We have shown that combining the dipolar model of dielectrophoresis force with an anisotropic drag force (integrating the wall-effect) provides an interesting ratio precision/computation time.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Mixed reality (MR)opens up new vistas for human-robot interaction (HRI)scenarios in which a human operator can control and collaborate with co-located robots. For instance, when using a see-through head-mounted-display (HMD)such as the Microsoft HoloLens, the operator can see the real robots and additional virtual information can be superimposed over the real-world view to improve security, acceptability and predictability in HRI situations. In particular, previewing potential robot actions in-situ before they are executed has enormous potential to reduce the risks of damaging the system or injuring the human operator. In this paper, we introduce the concept and implementation of such an MR human-robot collaboration system in which a human can intuitively and naturally control a co-located industrial robot arm for pick-and-place tasks. In addition, we compared two different, multimodal HRI techniques to select the pick location on a target object using (i)head orientation (aka heading)or (ii)pointing, both in combination with speech. The results show that heading-based interaction techniques are more precise, require less time and are perceived as less physically, temporally and mentally demanding for MR-based pick-and-place scenarios. We confirmed these results in an additional usability study in a delivery-service task with a multi-robot system. The developed MR interface shows a preview of the current robot programming to the operator, e. g., pick selection or trajectory. The findings provide important implications for the design of future MR setups.",

We improve the sample complexity of this approach by imposing a structure of the state-action function through a normalized advantage function (NAF). This representation of the policy enables efficiently composing multiple learned models without additional training samples or interaction with the environment. We demonstrate the performance of this algorithm on learning obstacle-avoidance policies in multiple simulations of a robot equipped with a laser scanner while navigating in a 2D environment. We apply the composition operation to various policy combinations and test them to show that the composed policies retain the performance of their components. We also transfer the composed policy directly to a physical platform operating in an arena with obstacles in order to demonstrate a degree of generalization.",

        "abstract": "For a service robot, it is not adequate to let its navigational movement be based only on a single metric, such as minimum distance path. In the environment where the robot and humans are coexisting, the robot should always perform social navigation whenever it is moving. However, to perform social navigation, the robot needs to follow certain \u201csocial norms\u201d of the environment. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique is popularly applied to the robotics field; yet, it is rarely used to solve the mentioned social navigation problem, generally deemed as a high dimension complex problem. In this paper, we propose the composite reinforcement learning (CRL) framework under which the robot learns appropriate social navigation with sensor input and reward update based on human feedback. For learning the aspect of human robot interaction (HRI), we provide a method to facilitate the training of DRL in real environment by incorporating prior knowledge to the system. It turns out that our CRL system not only can incrementally learn how to set its velocity and to perform HRI but also keep collecting human feedback to synchronize the reward functions to the current social norms. The experiments show that the proposed CRL system can safely learn how to navigate in the environment and show that our system is able to perform HRI for social navigation.",

We use a form of whole-body controllers that is very general via incorporating centroidal momentum dynamics, operational task priorities, contact reaction forces, and internal force constraints. First, we achieve efficiency by solving a quadratic program that only involves the floating base dynamics and the reaction forces. Second, we achieve computational robustness by relaxing task accelerations such that they comply with friction cone constraints. Finally, we incorporate methods for smooth contact transitions to enhance the control of dynamic locomotion behaviors. The proposed methods are demonstrated both in simulation and in real experiments using a passive-ankle bipedal robot.",

In this paper we consider suspended CDPR with sagging cables that can support only a limited tension. We propose an algorithm to compute the border of horizontal cross-sections of the workspace for a given altitude and orientation of the platform. We show that singularities of the kinematics equations have to be taken into account for a proper determination of the border and that the workspace can be separated in several components according to the branch of the inverse kinematics on which the robot is evolving. We also compare the workspace obtained for ideal and sagging cables.",

        "abstract": "Mobile robots have been used for various purposes with different functionalities which require them to freely move in environments containing both static and dynamic obstacles to accomplish given tasks. One of the most relevant capabilities in terms of navigating a mobile robot in such an environment is to find a safe path to a goal position. This paper shows that there exists an accurate solution to the Laplace equation which allows finding a collision-free path and that it can be efficiently calculated for a rectangular bounded domain such as a map which is represented as an image. This is accomplished by the use of the monogenic scale space resulting in a vector field which describes the attracting and repelling forces from the obstacles and the goal. The method is shown to work in reasonably convex domains and by the use of tessellation of the environment map for non-convex environments.",

Our approach is two-fold: i) a spatial topology analysis of point cloud segment constellations within objects. Therein constellations are decomposed and described in an hierarchical manner - from single segments to segment groups until a single group reflects an entire object. ii) a topology analysis of the description space in which segment decompositions are exposed in. Inspired by Persistent Homology, hidden groups of shape commonalities are revealed from object segment decompositions. Experiments show that extracted persistent groups of commonalities can represent semantically meaningful shape concepts. We also show the generalization capability of the proposed approach considering samples of external datasets.",

The k-PAM is able to measure the change in length of the actuator body according to the applied air pressures as well as the strain due to external force. A complete fabrication method is presented to make the actuator work for higher pressure (\u2265 300[kPa]). Since the force generated by the actuator is decoupled from the external force, ultimately, it can be directly used to measure not only the length but also the force. Experimental validations are performed describing the characteristics of two different types of k-PAMs. It is expected that the k-PAM can be used directly for robotic applications in higher pressure condition, while the semi-permanent conductive knit provides the actuator with durability in high repetitive operation environment.",

        "abstract": "When robot manipulators decide how to reach for an object, hand it over, or obey some task constraint, they implicitly assume a Euclidean distance metric in their configuration space. Their notion of what makes a configuration closer or further is dictated by this assumption. But different distance metrics will lead to different solutions. What is efficient under a Euclidean metric might not necessarily look the most efficient or natural to a person observing the robot. In this paper, we analyze the effect of the metric on robot behavior, examining both Euclidean, as well as non-Euclidean metrics - metrics that make certain joints cheaper, or that correlate different joints. Our user data suggests that tasks on a 3DOF arm and the Jaco 7DOF arm can typically be grouped into ones where a Euclidean metric works well, and tasks where that is no longer the case: there, surprisingly, penalizing elbow motion (and sometimes correlating the shoulder and wrist) leads to solutions that are more aligned with what users prefer.",

        "abstract": "Robotic manipulators that are intended to interact with humans in their operating region are systems that need formal safety guarantees. Current solutions cannot handle both input and state constraints, have difficulties handling nonconvex constraints, or are computationally too expensive. To tackle these drawbacks, we analyzed a constrained control strategy, the Explicit Reference Governor (ERG), which can address both input and state constraints, and does not require any online optimization, thus making it computationally inexpensive. This paper presents the theory of the ERG for a general robotic manipulator and shows simulations for a specific 2DOF planar robotic manipulator. The proposed control scheme is able to steer the robot arm to the desired end-effector position, or an admissible approximation, in the presence of limited joint ranges, actuator saturations, and static obstacles. As a result, the ERG is a promising tool for the control of robotic manipulators subject to constraints.",

        "abstract": "Sampling-based planning algorithms have been extensively exploited to solve a wide variety of problems. In recent years, many efforts have been dedicated to extend these tools to solve problems involving constraints, such as geometric loop-closure, which lead the valid Configuration Space (CS) to collapse to a lower-dimensional manifold. One proposed solution considers an approximation of the constrained Configuration Space that is obtained by relaxing constraints up to a desired tolerance. The resulting set has then non-zero measure, allowing to exploit classical planning algorithms to search for a path connecting two given states. When constraints involve kinematic loops in the system, relaxation generally bears to undesired contact forces, which need to be compensated during execution by a proper control action. We propose a new tool that exploits relaxation to plan in presence of constraints. Local motions inside the approximated manifold are found as the result of an iterative scheme that uses Quadratic Optimization to proceed towards a new sample without falling outside the relaxed region. By properly guiding the exploration, paths are found with smaller relaxation factors and the need of a dedicated controller to compensate errors is reduced. We complete the analysis by showing the feasibility of the approach with experiments on a real platform.",

        "abstract": "Grippers made from soft elastomers are able to passively and gently adapt to their targets allowing deformable objects to be grasped safely without causing bruise or damage. However, it is difficult to regulate the contact forces due to the lack of contact feedback for such grippers. In this paper, a modular soft gripper is presented utilizing interchangeable soft pneumatic actuators with embedded flex sensors as fingers of the gripper. The fingers can be assembled in different configurations using 3D printed connectors. The paper investigates the potential of utilizing the simple sensory feedback from the flex and pressure sensors to make additional meaningful inferences regarding the contact state and grasped object size. We study the effect of the grasped object size and contact type on the combined feedback from the embedded flex sensors of opposing fingers. Our results show that a simple linear relationship exists between the grasped object size and the final flex sensor reading at fixed input conditions, despite the variation in object weight and contact type. Additionally, by simply monitoring the time series response from the flex sensor, contact can be detected by comparing the response to the known free-bending response at the same input conditions. Furthermore, by utilizing the measured internal pressure supplied to the soft fingers, it is possible to distinguish between power and pinch grasps, as the contact type affects the rate of change in the flex sensor readings against the internal pressure.",

        "abstract": "The dangerous work situation in industrial leakage accidents urgently needs a flexible and small robot to help workers perform operations and to protect them from being injured. An aerial manipulator system consisting of a hexa-rotor UAV and a one-DOF manipulator is developed, and is used to press an emergency switch to shut off machinery in an emergency. In practical application, an aerial manipulator usually performs contact operations as the UAV platform is in hover flight. The hovering UAV acting as a spring-mass-damper system is firstly proved. Then, based on the derived spring-mass-damper system model and the impedance control algorithm, the force-sensorless contact force control method is presented. That is, the force is indirectly controlled through controlling the UAV's position error and pitch angle simultaneously. The practical operation experiment of pressing an emergency button shows that the proposed method is able to control the contact force as the aerial manipulator interacts with the external environment.",

        "abstract": "Soft artificial skin sensors that can detect contact forces as well as their locations are attractive in various soft robotics applications. However, soft sensors made of polymer materials have inherent limitations of hysteresis and nonlinearity in response, which makes it highly difficult to implement traditional calibration techniques and yields poor estimation performance. In this paper, we propose intelligent algorithms based on machine learning and logics that can improve the performance of soft sensors. The proposed methods in this paper could be solutions to the aforementioned long-standing problems. They can also be used to simplify the system complexity by reducing the number of signal wires. Three machine learning techniques are discussed in this paper: an artificial neural network (ANN), the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm, and a recurrent neural network (RNN). The Preisach model of hysteresis and simple logics were used to support these algorithms. We proved that classifying contact locations on a soft sensor is possible using simple algorithms in real time. Also, force estimation of a single contact was possible using an ANN with the Preisach method. Finally, we successfully estimated forces of multiple contact locations by predicting the outputs of mixed RNN results.",

        "abstract": "A robot with contact sensing capability can reduce uncertainty relative to the environment by deliberately moving into contact and matching the resulting contact measurement to different possible states in the world. We present a manipulation planner that finds and sequences these actions by reasoning explicitly about the uncertainty over the robot's state. The planner incrementally constructs a policy that covers all possible contact states during a manipulation and finds contingencies for each of them. In contrast to conformant planners (without contingencies), the planned contingent policies are more robust. We demonstrate this in simulated and real-world manipulation experiments. In contrast to POMDP-based planners, we show that our planner can be directly applied to high-dimensional configuration spaces.",

        "abstract": "The brain-machine interface (BMI) has been reported to offer the potential for controlling the assistive robot for the motor impaired people, using the non-invasively obtained electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, the EEG based BMI may not be sufficient and stable to drive the robot moving freely in its 2D or 3D workspace. The robot autonomy may provide assistance for the BMI users with the shared control paradigm. Nevertheless, users suffers from several limitations of the current shared control paradigms applied on BMI, e.g., loss of sense of control, high mental workload due to unintuitive control with the human-robot interface and fixed level of assistance. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a new control paradigm for the robotic arm reaching task where the robot autonomy is dynamically blended with the gaze-BMI control from a user. In this paradigm, the hybrid gaze-BMI constitutes an intuitive and effective input to continuously control the robotic arm end-effector moving freely in its 2D workspace, with an adjustable speed proportional to the motion intention strength. Furthermore, the adjustable level of assistance by our paradigm allows the system to balance the user's capabilities and feelings of control while compensating for the reaching task's difficulty. The proposed paradigm is verified in the task where a healthy subject utilizes the hybrid gaze-BMI to control the robotic arm end-effector reaching for a target object while avoiding the obstacle in the path. The experimental results demonstrate that the movements with our shared control paradigm are safer, more efficient and less difficult than those without shared control.",

        "abstract": "Decision making under uncertainty is a challenging task, especially when dealing with complex robotics scenarios. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework, designed to solve this problem, was subject to much work lately. Most POMDP solvers, however, focus on planning in discrete state, action and/or observations spaces, which does not truly reflect the complexity of most real world problems. This paper addresses the issue by devising a method for solving POMDPs with continuous state, action and observations spaces. The proposed planner, Continuous Belief Tree Search (CBTS), uses Bayesian Optimisation (BO) to dynamically sample promising actions while constructing a belief tree. This dynamic sampling allows for richer action selection than offline action discretisation. CBTS is complemented by a novel trajectory generation technique, relying on the theory of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS), yielding trajectories amenable for robotics applications. The resulting trajectory planner kCBTS outperforms other continuous planners on space modelling and robot parking problems.",

These slender manipulators usually possess either a hyper-redundant articulated vertebrate structure or a continuum one. Primary design considerations usually converge to a balance between proper workspace and acceptable stiffness. Efforts have hence been constantly made to achieve higher or adjustable stiffness for a manipulator to widen its applications. This paper presents a simple continuum manipulator design with variable stiffness based on redundantly arranged elastic backbones and continuously constrained bending curvature. The design concepts, kinematics, a preliminary formulation for stiffness adjustment, system construction and experimental characterizations are elaborated. The results showed that the manipulator's stiffness can be increased up to 4.71 times of the value without the curvature constraining rod, indicating the efficacy of the proposed idea.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we design nonlinear state feedback controllers for discrete-time polynomial dynamical systems via the occupation measure approach. We propose the discrete-time controlled Liouville equation, and use it to formulate the controller synthesis problem as an infinite-dimensional linear programming problem on measures, which is then relaxed as finite-dimensional semidefinite programming problems on moments of measures and their duals on sums-of-squares polynomials. Nonlinear controllers can be extracted from the solutions to the relaxed problems. The advantage of the occupation measure approach is that we solve convex problems instead of generally non-convex problems, and the computational complexity is polynomial in the state and input dimensions, and hence the approach is more scalable. In addition, we show that the approach can be applied to over-approximating the backward reachable set of discrete-time autonomous polynomial systems and the controllable set of discrete-time polynomial systems under known state feedback control laws. We illustrate our approach on several dynamical systems.",

A closed-loop adaptive control and an open-loop FES of the quadriceps muscle group are combined together to track a desired knee joint angle trajectory of flexion/extension movements. A nonlinear disturbance observer is used to estimate the torque provided by the subject's muscles through the FES. Simulations and experiments with a healthy subject show the feasibility of the proposed approach. Experiments show the repeatability of motion and the complementarity between the torque provided by the quadriceps muscle through FES and the one delivered by the orthosis actuator to ensure satisfactory tracking of the desired trajectory.",

In the presented approach the UAVs are relying only on their onboard computer and sensory system, deployed for inspection of the 3D structure. In this application each agent covers a different part of the scene autonomously, while avoiding collisions. The autonomous navigation of each platform on the designed path is enabled by the localization system that fuses Ultra Wideband with inertial measurements through an Error- State Kalman Filter. The visual information collected from the aerial team is collaboratively processed to create the 3D model. The performance of the overall setup has been experimentally evaluated in realistic wind turbine inspection experiments, providing dense 3D reconstruction of the inspected structures.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "To deploy a robot in a human-centric environment, it is important that the robot is able to continuously acquire and update object categories while working in the environment. Therefore, autonomous robots must have the ability to continuously execute learning and recognition in a concurrent or interleaved fashion. One of the main challenges in unconstrained human environments is to cope with the effects of context change. This paper presents two main contributions: (i) an approach for evaluating open-ended object category learning and recognition methods in multi-context scenarios; (ii) evaluation of different object category learning and recognition approaches regarding their ability to cope with the effects of context change. Off-line evaluation approaches such as cross-validation do not comply with the simultaneous nature of learning and recognition. A teaching protocol, supporting context change, was therefore designed and used in this work for experimental evaluation. Seven learning and recognition approaches were evaluated and compared using the protocol. The best performance, in terms of number of learned categories, was obtained with a recently proposed local variant of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), closely followed by a Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach. In terms of adaptability, i.e. coping with context change, the best result was obtained with BoW, immediately followed by the local LDA variant.",

        "abstract": "Decentralized receding horizon control (D-RHC) provides a mechanism for coordination in multiagent settings without a centralized command center. However, combining a set of different goals, costs, and constraints to form an efficient optimization objective for D-RHC can be difficult. To allay this problem, we use a meta-learning process - cost adaptation - which generates the optimization objective for D-RHC to solve based on a set of human-generated priors (cost and constraint functions) and an auxiliary heuristic. We use this adaptive D-RHC method for control of mesh-networked swarm agents. This formulation allows a wide range of tasks to be encoded and can account for network delays, heterogeneous capabilities, and increasingly large swarms through the adaptation mechanism. We leverage the Unity3D game engine to build a simulator capable of introducing artificial networking failures and delays in the swarm. Using the simulator we validate our method on an example coordinated exploration task. We demonstrate that cost adaptation allows for more efficient and safer task completion under varying environment conditions and increasingly large swarm sizes. We release our simulator and code to the community for future work.",

Because we seek generalization across task instances and task types, we propose to capture style via cost functions that the robot can use to augment its nominal task cost and task constraints in a trajectory optimization process. We compare two approaches to representing such cost functions: a weighted linear combination of hand-designed features, and a neural network parameterization operating on raw trajectory input. For each cost type, we learn weights for each style from user feedback. We contrast these approaches to a nominal motion across different tasks and for different styles in a user study, and find that they both perform on par with each other, and significantly outperform the baseline. Each approach has its advantages: featurized costs require learning fewer parameters and can perform better on some styles, but neural network representations do not require expert knowledge to design features and could even learn more complex, nuanced costs than an expert can easily design.",

Terrains excerpt different mechanical properties when crawled by a multi-legged robot, and thus different values of the CoT. It is therefore desirable to estimate the CoT in advance and plan the robot motion accordingly. However, the CoT might not be known prior the robot deployment, e.g., in extraterrestrial missions; hence, a robot has to learn different terrains as it crawls through the environment incrementally. In this work, we focus on estimating the CoT from visual and geometrical data of the crawled terrain. A thorough analysis of different terrain descriptors within the context of incremental learning is presented to select the best performing approach. We report on the achieved results and experimental verification of the selected approaches with a real hexapod robot crawling over six different terrains.",

They are of particular interest in Learning from Demonstration, as here we aim to carry out actions in a certain fashion, without a model or in-depth knowledge about the world, which might be difficult to achieve with a planner. Using model-based dynamic systems in task space enables robots to flexibly reproduce demonstrated actions. Nevertheless, when dealing with mobile manipulators, we face the challenge of including the kinematic constraints of the robot in the action models. In this paper we propose to couple robot base and end-effector motions generated by arbitrary dynamical systems modulating the base velocity, while respecting the robots kinematic design. To this end we learn an approximation of the inverse reachability in closed form. In real-world robot experiments we demonstrate that we are able to maintain kinematically feasible trajectories in the presence of obstacles and in configurations differing profoundly from the training scene.",

In this work, we argue for cars that are not optimizing a purely selfish cost, but also try to be courteous to other interactive drivers. We formalize courtesy as a term in the objective that measures the increase in another driver's cost induced by the autonomous car's behavior. Such a courtesy term enables the robot car to be aware of possible irrationality of the human behavior, and plan accordingly. We analyze the effect of courtesy in a variety of scenarios. We find, for example, that courteous robot cars leave more space when merging in front of a human driver. Moreover, we find that such a courtesy term can help explain real human driver behavior on the NGSIM dataset.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a coverage algorithm for multi-robot systems where the robots are equipped with qualitatively different sensing modalities. Unlike previous approaches to the problem of coverage for teams with heterogeneous sensing capabilities, in this paper the robots have access to information about their neighbors' specific sensor modalities. This knowledge affords the ability of ensuring that no robot is tasked with covering features in a region without the required sensing modalities. With this information, a robot can determine which of its neighbors it should coordinate with to cover the environmental features in a region while ignoring robots that are not equipped with that particular sensory capability. We derive a distributed control algorithm that allows the robots to move in a direction of descent relative to a novel locational cost, in order to minimize it. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on a real robotic platform.",

We employ an iterative measurement and modeling scheme to incrementally deploy sensors so as to achieve spatial coverage, despite only controlling the initial sample point. Once deployed, sensors are moved about a survey area by ambient surface currents. We demonstrate our results in simulation on 40 different ocean flow fields and compare against several baselines. This work provides a computational tool for scientists seeking a low-cost, autonomous marine surveying system. Although in this paper, we concentrate on ocean drifters, our approach can be extended to other domains where a spatial distribution of passive nodes in a flow field can be modeled.",

The developed algorithm, Adaptive Search Space Coverage Path Planner (ASSCPP), utilizes an existing 3D reference model of the complex structure and the onboard sensors' noise models to generate paths that are evaluated based on the traveling distance and the quality of the model. The algorithm generates a set of viewpoints by performing adaptive sampling that directs the search towards areas with low accuracy and low coverage. The algorithm predicts the coverage percentage obtained by following the generated coverage path using the reference model. A set of experiments were conducted in real and simulated environments with structures of different complexities to test the validity of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Task autonomy is an important consideration for the development of future surgical robots. For robot-assisted anastomosis, suture thread detection is a prerequisite for subsequent robot manipulation. Previous works on automatic thread detection are focused on the learning of the models with specific surgical settings that are poorly generalisable to generic settings. In this paper, we propose a joint feature learning framework that caters for the foreground and background adaptation for surgical suture thread detection. The proposed method is developed in the context of semi-supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation, leveraging the labelled training data from the source domain to learn the detection model for unlabelled or partially labelled target domain, which can also be from different types of threads or organs. Based on adversarial learning, we further preserve the semantic identity and introduce curriculum adaptation to generate synthetic data. Experiments on four domain adaptation tasks for suture thread detection demonstrate the strength of the proposed method being able to generate good quality synthetic data and transfer between specific domains with limited or even no labelled data of the target domain.",

For example, greeting is done differently in France, in Sweden or in Japan; and the average interpersonal distance changes from one cultural group to the other. In order to successfully coexist with humans, robots should also adapt their behavior to the culture, customs and manners of the persons they interact with. In this paper, we deal with an important ingredient of cultural adaptation: how to generate robot plans that respect given cultural preferences, and how to execute them in a way that is sensitive to those preferences. We present initial results in this direction in the context of the CARESSES project, a joint EU-Japan effort to build culturally competent assistive robots.",

        "abstract": "Many children on autism spectrum have atypical behavioral expressions of engagement compared to their neu-rotypical peers. In this paper, we investigate the performance of deep learning models in the task of automated engagement estimation from face images of children with autism. Specifically, we use the video data of 30 children with different cultural backgrounds (Asia vs. Europe) recorded during a single session of a robot-assisted autism therapy. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed deep architectures for the target task, including within- and across-culture evaluations, as well as when using the child-independent and child-dependent settings. We also introduce a novel deep learning model, named CultureNet, which efficiently leverages the multi-cultural data when performing the adaptation of the proposed deep architecture to the target culture and child. We show that due to the highly heterogeneous nature of the image data of children with autism, the child-independent models lead to overall poor estimation of target engagement levels. On the other hand, when a small amount of data of target children is used to enhance the model learning, the estimation performance on the held-out data from those children increases significantly. This is the first time that the effects of individual and cultural differences in children with autism have empirically been studied in the context of deep learning performed directly from face images.",

The system achieves high accuracy in object detection and tracking in 3-D using an extended deep learning-based 2.5-D detector and a 3-D object tracker with the ability to track 3-D object locations even outside the camera field-of-view. We train our detector with a large number of images with 2.5-D object ground-truth (i.e., 2-D object bounding boxes and distance from the camera to objects). A novel combination of HTC Vive Tracker with our system enables us to automatically obtain the ground-truth labels for training while requiring very little human effort to set up the system. Moreover, our system processes frames in real-time through a client-server computing platform such that BVI people can receive realtime vibrotactile guidance. We conduct a thorough user study on 12 BVI people in new environments with object instances which are unseen during training. Our system outperforms the non-assistive guiding strategy with statistic significance in both time and the number of contacting irrelevant objects. Finally, the interview with BVI users confirms that our system with distance-based vibrotactile feedback is mostly preferred, especially for objects requiring gentle manipulation such as a bottle with water inside.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a deep neural network (DNN) based integrated background noise suppression and acoustic modeling for speech recognition proposed in which on/off state of the motor for the head shaking robot is employed as the relevant auxiliary information of the DNN input. Since the motor sound being generated when the robot is moving or shaking its head severely degrades the performance of the speech recognition accuracy, we propose to use the motor on/off state as additional information when designing the DNN-based recognition system. Our speech recognition algorithm consists of two parts including the feature mapping model for feature enhancement and the acoustic model for phoneme recognition. As for the feature mapping, the stacked DNN is designed for the precise feature enhancement such that the lower DNN and upper DNN are trained separately and combined after which the motor state is plugged into both the lower DNN and upper DNN in addition to the input noisy speech. Then, the acoustic model is trained upon the feature enhancement model in which the motor state is again used as the augmented feature. The proposed technique to suppress the acoustic and motor noises was evaluated in term of the phoneme error rate (PER) and showed a significant improvement over the conventional system.",

The dataset contains both clean and noisy in-flight audio recordings continuously annotated with the 3D position of the target sound source using an accurate motion capture system. In addition, various signals of interests are available such as the rotational speed of individual rotors and inertial measurements at all time. Besides introducing the dataset, this paper sheds light on the specific properties, challenges and opportunities brought by the emerging task of UAV-embedded sound source localization. Several baseline methods are evaluated and compared on the dataset, with real-time applicability in mind. Very promising results are obtained for the localization of a broad-band source in loud noise conditions, while speech localization remains a challenge under extreme noise levels.",

        "abstract": "Wire detection, depth estimation and avoidance is one of the hardest challenges towards the ubiquitous presence of robust autonomous aerial vehicles. We present an approach and a system which tackles these three challenges along with generic obstacle avoidance as well. First, we perform monocular wire detection using a convolutional neural network under the semantic segmentation paradigm, and obtain a confidence map of wire pixels. Along with this, we also use a binocular stereo pair to detect other generic obstacles. We represent wires and generic obstacles using a disparity space representation and do a C-space expansion by using a non-linear sensor model we develop. Occupancy inference for collision checking is performed by maintaining a pose graph over multiple disparity images. For avoidance of wire and generic obstacles, we use a precomputed trajectory library, which is evaluated in an online fashion in accordance to a cost function over proximity to the goal. We follow this trajectory with a path tracking controller. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in simulation for wire mapping, and on hardware by multiple runs for both wire and generic obstacle avoidance.",

        "abstract": "Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is considered to be a fundamental capability for intelligent mobile robots. Over the past decades, many impressed SLAM systems have been developed and achieved good performance under certain circumstances. However, some problems are still not well solved, for example, how to tackle the moving objects in the dynamic environments, how to make the robots truly understand the surroundings and accomplish advanced tasks. In this paper, a robust semantic visual SLAM towards dynamic environments named DS-SLAM is proposed. Five threads run in parallel in DS-SLAM: tracking, semantic segmentation, local mapping, loop closing and dense semantic map creation. DS-SLAM combines semantic segmentation network with moving consistency check method to reduce the impact of dynamic objects, and thus the localization accuracy is highly improved in dynamic environments. Meanwhile, a dense semantic octo-tree map is produced, which could be employed for high-level tasks. We conduct experiments both on TUM RGB-D dataset and in real-world environment. The results demonstrate the absolute trajectory accuracy in DS-SLAM can be improved one order of magnitude compared with ORB-SLAM2. It is one of the state-of-the-art SLAM systems in high-dynamic environments.",

This is at least the case if time-continuous trajectories need to be generated online. In this paper we take advantage of a simple controller structure, which reduces the motion planning to a discrete-time planning problem, in which only a small set of input parameters need to be determined for each step. We show that for a planar leg with serial elastic actuation, hopping on a ground with stairs of irregular length and height can be planned online, based on a parameter mapping which has been learned in a data-driven manner by performing hopping trials with an adaptive exploration algorithm to evenly sample the parameter space. Experiments on a planar hopping leg prototype validate the approach.",

This problem arises in tasks where a robot observes the progress of another robot that is stochastically following a known trajectory, among other applications. We formulate and solve a variant where multiple tracker robots must monitor a single target robot, which is important because it enables the use of multi-robot systems to improve task performance in practice, such as in marine robotics missions. Our algorithm coordinates the behaviour of the trackers by computing optimal single-robot paths given a probabilistic representation of the other robots' paths. We employ a decentralised scheme that optimises over probability distributions of plans and has useful analytical properties. The planned trajectories collectively maximise the probability of observing the target throughout the mission with respect to probabilistic motion and observation models. We report simulation results for up to 8 robots that support our analysis and indicate that our algorithm is a feasible solution for improving the performance of mission monitoring systems.",

Our approach tackles scenarios in which the swarm must reach multiple spatially distributed targets, and enforce the constraint that the robot network cannot be split. The basic idea behind our work is to construct a logical tree topology over the physical network formed by the robots. The logical tree acts as a backbone used by robots to enforce connectivity constraints. We study and compare two algorithms to form the logical tree: outwards and inwards. These algorithms differ in the order in which the robots join the tree: the outwards algorithm starts at the tree root and grows towards the targets, while the inwards algorithm proceeds in the opposite manner. Both algorithms perform periodic reconfiguration, to prevent suboptimal topologies from halting the growth of the tree. Our contributions are (i) The formulation of the two algorithms; (ii) A comparison of the algorithms in extensive physics-based simulations; (iii) A validation of our findings through real-robot experiments.",

        "abstract": "Highly accurate and robust real-time localization is an essential technique for various autonomous driving applications. Numerous localization methods have been proposed that combine various types of sensors, including an environmental sensor, IMU and GPS. However, the usage of a single environmental sensor is rather fragile. Although the use of multi-environment sensors is a better alternative, fusion methods from previous studies have not adequately compensated for shortcomings in dissimilar sensors or have not considered errors in the pre-built map. In this paper, we propose a decentralized localization framework using heterogeneous map-matching sources. Decentralized localization performs two independent map-matchings and integrates them with a stochastic situational analysis model. By applying a stochastic model, the reliability of the two map matchings is collected and system stability is verified. A number of experiments with autonomous vehicles within the actual driving environment have shown that combining multiple map-matching sources ensures more robust results than the use of a single environmental sensor.",

        "abstract": "A provably stable decentralized control scheme is proposed to allow multiple conventional quadcopters carry a cable-suspended payload. The method exploits a fundamental energetic passivity property of the combined drones, cables, and payload system to stably move the payload from its origin to destination. This is achieved without making any assumption about the status of the cables tension during the flight, and any measurement from the payload. The controller is decentralized in the sense that inter-drone communication of feedback measurements is not required. Motion stability is demonstrated via a Lyapunov analysis. The proposed controller is successfully implemented on a three-drone payload transport system in an indoor environment, using measurement from an optical tracking systems and the drones on-board IMUs.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses deep learning for solving static and dynamic search and recovery tasks - such as the retrieval of all instances of actively moving targets - based on partial-view Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-like sensing. In particular, we demonstrate that abstracted tactic and strategic explorational agency can be implemented effectively via a single deep network that optimises in unity: the mapping of sensory inputs and positional history towards navigational actions. We propose a dual-stream classification paradigm that integrates one Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for sensory processing with a second one for interpreting an evolving longterm map memory. In order to learn effective search behaviours given agent location and agent-centric sensory inputs, we train this design against 400k+ optimal navigational decision samples from each set of static and dynamic evolutions for different multi-target behaviour classes. We quantify recovery performance across an extensive range of scenarios; including probabilistic placement and dynamics, as well as fully random target walks and herd-inspired behaviours. Detailed results comparisons show that our design can outperform naive, independent stream and off-the-shelf DRQN solutions. We conclude that the proposed dual-stream architecture can provide a unified, rationally motivated and effective architecture for solving online search tasks in dynamic, multi-target environments. With this paper we publish3 key source code and associated models.",

        "abstract": "Reliable and accurate lane detection has been a long-standing problem in the field of autonomous driving. In recent years, many approaches have been developed that use images (or videos) as input and reason in image space. In this paper we argue that accurate image estimates do not translate to precise 3D lane boundaries, which are the input required by modern motion planning algorithms. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep neural network that takes advantage of both LiDAR and camera sensors and produces very accurate estimates directly in 3D space. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on both highways and in cities, and show very accurate estimates in complex scenarios such as heavy traffic (which produces occlusion), fork, merges and intersections.",

        "abstract": "We propose a reinforcement learning approach for automatically building dry stacked (i.e. no mortar) structures with irregular objects. Stacking irregular objects is a challenging problem since each assembly action can be drawn from a continuous space of poses for an object, and several local geometric and physical considerations strongly affect the stability. To tackle this challenge, we concentrate on a simplified 2D version of the problem. We present a reinforcement learning algorithm based on deep Q-learning, where the learned Q-function, which maps state-action pairs into expected long-term rewards, is represented by a deep neural network. As the action space is continuous the Q-network is trained by sampling a finite number of actions that consider both geometric and physical constraints to approximate the target Q-values, Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms previous heuristics-based planning, leading to super construction with objects containing a significant amount of variations. We validate the generated stacking plans by executing them using a robot arm and manufactured, irregular objects.",

The paper has the following contributions: (i) a novel audio-visual fusion framework that is well suited for controlling the gaze of a robotic head; (ii) a reinforcement learning (RL) formulation for the gaze control problem, using a reward function based on the available temporal sequence of camera and microphone observations; and (iii) several deep architectures that allow to experiment with early and late fusion of audio and visual data. We introduce a simulated environment that enables us to learn the proposed deep RL model without the need of spending hours of tedious interaction. By thoroughly experimenting on a publicly available dataset and on a real robot, we provide empirical evidence that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

Force-torque measurements from a robot arm wrist sensor are thereby incorporated two-fold; they are integrated into the policy learning process and they are exploited in an admittance controller that is coupled to the neural network. This enables robot learning of contact-rich assembly tasks without explicit joint torque control or passive mechanical compliance.

Reinforcement learning approaches fail to solve these tasks efficiently due to reward sparsities, temporal complexities and high-dimensionality of sensorimotor spaces which are inherent in such problems. We present a novel approach to train action policies to acquire navigation skills for wheel-legged robots using deep reinforcement learning. The policy maps height-map image observations to motor commands to navigate to a target position while avoiding obstacles. We propose to acquire the multifaceted navigation skill by learning and exploiting a number of manageable navigation behaviors. We also introduce a domain randomization technique to improve the versatility of the training samples. We demonstrate experimentally a significant improvement in terms of data-efficiency, success rate, robustness against irrelevant sensory data, and also the quality of the maneuver skills.",

        "abstract": "In autonomous driving systems a strong relation to highly accurate maps is taken to be inevitable, although street scenes change frequently. However, a preferable system would be to equip the automated cars with a sensor system that is able to navigate urban scenarios without an accurate map. We present a novel pipeline using a deep neural network to detect lane semantics and topology given RGB images. On the basis of this classification, the information about the road scene can be extracted just from the sensor setup supporting mapless autonomous driving. In addition to superseding the huge effort of creating and maintaining highly accurate maps, our system reduces the need for precise localization. Using an extended Cityscapes dataset, we show accurate ego lane detection including lane semantics on challenging scenarios for autonomous driving.",

        "abstract": "We demonstrate how a sequence model and a sampling-based planner can influence each other to produce efficient plans and how such a model can automatically learn to take advantage of observations of the environment. Sampling-based planners such as RRT generally know nothing of their environments even if they have traversed similar spaces many times. A sequence model, such as an HMM or LSTM, guides the search for good paths. The resulting model, called DeRRT*, observes the state of the planner and the local environment to bias the next move and next planner state. The neural-network-based models avoid manual feature engineering by co-training a convolutional network which processes map features and observations from sensors. We incorporate this sequence model in a manner that combines its likelihood with the existing bias for searching large unexplored Voronoi regions. This leads to more efficient trajectories with fewer rejected samples even in difficult domains such as when escaping bug traps. This model can also be used for dimensionality reduction in multi-agent environments with dynamic obstacles. Instead of planning in a high-dimensional space that includes the configurations of the other agents, we plan in a low-dimensional subspace relying on the sequence model to bias samples using the observed behavior of the other agents. The techniques presented here are general, include both graphical models and deep learning approaches, and can be adapted to a range of planners.",

        "abstract": "Sampling-based Motion Planners (SMPs) have become increasingly popular as they provide collision-free path solutions regardless of obstacle geometry in a given environment. However, their computational complexity increases significantly with the dimensionality of the motion planning problem. Adaptive sampling is one of the ways to speed up SMPs by sampling a particular region of a configuration space that is more likely to contain an optimal path solution. Although there are a wide variety of algorithms for adaptive sampling, they rely on hand-crafted heuristics; furthermore, their performance decreases significantly in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present a neural network-based adaptive sampler for motion planning called Deep Sampling-based Motion Planner (DeepSMP). DeepSMP generates samples for SMPs and enhances their overall speed significantly while exhibiting efficient scalability to higher-dimensional problems. DeepSMP's neural architecture comprises of a Contractive AutoEncoder which encodes given workspaces directly from a raw point cloud data, and a Dropout-based stochastic deep feedforward neural network which takes the workspace encoding, start and goal configuration, and iteratively generates feasible samples for SMPs to compute end-to-end collision-free optimal paths. DeepSMP is not only consistently computationally efficient in all tested environments but has also shown remarkable generalization to completely unseen environments. We evaluate DeepSMP on multiple planning problems including planning of a point-mass robot, rigid-body, 6-link robotic manipulator in various 2D and 3D environments. The results show that on average our method is at least 7 times faster in point-mass and rigid-body case and about 28 times faster in 6-link robot case than the existing state-of-the-art.",

The capacitive arrays are made of two electrode patterns embedded into a single silicone compound. The overlaps of the electrode strip patterns form local capacitors. As the sensor is stretched the local capacitance measurements change. We introduce a fabrication technique that allows to produce such sensors while only requiring hardware readily available in modern fablabs. The resulting sensors are able to densely capture area changes as they deform. Since they do not directly measure bend, a prior is required to fully reconstruct the underlying motion. We propose a deep neural network regressing the sensor geometry from the local area measurements. A motion capture system is used for training data acquisition. At runtime vertex positions are predicted and used as positional constraints to deform a mesh using a state-of-the-art elastic surface energy. The flexibility and accuracy of the introduced sensors is demonstrated in a series of controlled experiments and by fabricating a prototype sensor and applying it to capture deforming skeletal and non-skeletal objects.",

        "abstract": "Motivated by the need for tools to aid in the design of effective robots, we examine how to determine the role that particular sensing and actuator resources play in enabling a robot to achieve useful ends. Rather than merely asking \u201cwill this sensor suffice?\u201d we classify general modifications to the set of sensors and actuators based on the feasibility of accomplishing given tasks using these sets. The goal is to probe the boundary between modifications that are destructive on a given planning problem, and modifications that are not. Since this boundary itself can be impractically large, classic search methods are of no avail to summarize discriminatory features on this boundary. Instead, we propose a decision tree learning method to efficiently construct a compact implicit representation of the boundary. The idea is to allow the designer to use prior knowledge to constrain the search, then use the tool to probe the boundary subject to those constraints, gaining insight into the information necessary for a robot to ensure task achievement. Ultimately we envision a interactive process where additional constraints are repeatedly included as new light is shed. We aim to pave the way for interactive tools that help the roboticist navigate the complexities of the design space. We describe an implementation of this approach along with experimental results that show that the method can construct decision trees with explanatory value. Our experiments suggest that some domain knowledge (specifically picking features that emphasize monotonicity) substantially improves running-time with only negligible reduction in accuracy.",

This paper describes a depth estimation method based on supervised learning for optically transparent microrobots of known geometry. The proposed methodology uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) combined with a Recurrent Network, in particular a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell for depth regression. The proposed depth regression model is independent of the 3D orientation of the microrobot and is robust to varying illumination levels while it uses learned data-specific features. The model is trained and validated using microscope images and ground truth data generated from 3D-printed microrobots imaged in an Optical Tweezers (OT) setup. The validation results demonstrate that the proposed trained model can reconstruct the depth of the microrobot independently of its 3D orientation with submicron accuracy for the test set.",

        "abstract": "Long flexible continuum robots have a high potential for search and rescue operations that explore deep layered debris. A general problem of these robots is in the control of the head motion because their thin bodies limit the space available to mount multiple actuators. This paper develops a biaxial active nozzle which can rotate the air jet direction along a roll and pitch axis in order to control the direction of reaction force and the head motion of a long flexible robot. A major challenge is how to change the air jet direction without a large resistance to the flow, which reduces the reaction force induced by the air jet. We propose a nozzle whose outlet is connected with a flexible air tube. The direction of the air jet is controlled by the smooth shape deformation of the tube. The nozzle should be compact enough to be installed on a thin robot, although the shape deformation of the tube may cause buckling. The flexible tube is modeled and simulated by a multiple link model used to derive the geometric parameters of the nozzle so that the nozzle is compact and the tube does not buckle. Based on the derived parameters, the biaxial active nozzle was developed. A basic performance experiment shows that the nozzle can change the reaction force direction by deforming the tube shape, while the magnitude of the reaction force is almost constant. We integrated the proposed nozzle with a conventional Active Scope Camera (ASC). The range where the robot can look around in a vertical exploration was significantly improved, which was three times larger than the previous ASC whose head was controlled by pneumatic actuators. The rubble field test demonstrates that the integrated ASC could move over rubble (maximum height of 200 mm) and steer the course.",

        "abstract": "In-situ aeroengine maintenance works (e.g. inspection, repair) are highly beneficial as it can significantly reduce currently accepted maintenance cycle which is extensive and costly due to the need to remove engines from the wing of an aircraft. However, feeding in/out via inspection ports and performing a multi-axis movement of an end-effector in a very constrained environment such as aeroengine combustion chamber is a fairly challenging task. This paper presents the design and development of a highly slender (i.e., low diameter-to-length ratio) dual-structure continuum robot with 16 degrees of freedom (DoFs) to provide the feeding motion needed to navigate into confined environments and then perform a required configuration shape for further repair operation. This continuum robot is a compact system and presents a set of innovative mechatronic solutions such as: (i) two-stage tendon-driven structure with bevelled disk design to perform required configuration shape and to provide selective stiffness for the ability of taking high payloads; (ii) various compliant joints to enable different flexibility requirement in each stage; (iii) three commanding cables for each 2-DoF section to minimise the number of actuators with a precise actuation. To be able to achieve the desired configuration shape, a kinematic model has been established and the configuration-cable kinematics has been implemented. Finally, the continuum robot has been built and tested for performing the predefined configuration shape.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel hydrostatic air-liquid torque transmission system for an upper limb exoskeleton. The proposed design is based on remote electrical actuation, with grounded motors, combined with high performance fluid power transmission employed to deliver the power to the joints of the exoskeleton. The fluid transmission is based on rolling membrane cylinders that guarantee leakage-free operation, no backlash, and virtually zero stick-friction. This solution makes it possible to obtain easy controllability, good efficiency, intrinsic backdrivable operation, and reduced mass/inertia of the links of the robot. Additionally, the proposed system can be potentially implemented at relatively low-costs thanks to the employment of standard components and an architecture based on a modular approach. A test bench of the fluid transmission system is developed and a campaign of experiments is conducted to characterize its static/dynamic response for different choice of design parameters. In addition, we present a preliminary complete integrated arrangement of an upper limb exoskeleton equipped with the proposed transmission system. Results confirm the feasibility of the proposed actuation approach for the envisaged application.",

We have developed a novel hydraulic wheel-legged robot (WLR) combined with a humanoid structural design. This robot can assist to emergency scenarios where the high mobility, adaptability and robustness are required. The paper introduces the details of the WLR, highlighting the innovative design and optimization of physical construction which is considered to maximize the mobile abilities, enhance the environmental adaptability and improve the reliability of hydraulic system. Firstly, maximizing the mobile abilities includes optimizing the configuration of each actuator and integrating them with the structure, so as to achieve a large range of movement and also reduce the mass and inertia of the legs. Secondly, the environmental adaptability can be ensured with a magnetorheological (MR) fluid-based damper and direct-drive wheels. Thirdly, improving the reliability of hydraulic system involves using the selective laser melting (SLM) technology to integrate hydraulic system and reducing the number of exposed tubes. The maneuverability of the WLR is demonstrated with a series of experiments. At present, the WLR can perform the following operations, including moving on the flat ground, squatting, and picking up a heavy load.",

It is designed to have a light structural inertia and large workspace for agile bipedal locomotion. A new version of Hybrid Leg is fabricated with carbon fiber tubes and bearings to improve its structural rigidity and accuracy while supporting its weight. A pair of Hybrid Legs is assembled together for bipedal locomotion. In the assembly, we adopt a pelvis structure with an yaw angle offset to enlarge the feet workspace, inspired by the toe-out angle of the human feet. The workspace and range of velocity are presented in simulation and verified with hardware experiments. We also demonstrate a simple forward walking motion with the developed robot.",

It provides 3-axial (x, y, and z)translational motion and stable hovering for more than an hour after takeoff. S-CLOUD consists of two parts; soft blimp part and driving one. The soft blimp is a center-pierced torus-shaped part filled with Helium gas. Thus, it is safe to fly near people because it is light and soft, and all its rotating parts are at the center of the vehicle, which does not get damaged on collision. The driving part is plugged into the center of the soft blimp and includes the flow control mechanism, which consists of co-axial rotors and 2-axis crossed flaps. It controls the altitude, attitude, and translational movements of the vehicle. Its dynamic and reaction features against disturbances are derived using Newton-Euler formulation, and the simulation results are discussed. Finally, a prototype of S-CLOUD is fabricated and its feasibility is experimentally validated with practical applications.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the design and implementation of a preliminary version of a programmable drawing automaton (PDA-0) that draws a user-specified 3D trajectory. PDA-0 is strongly inspired by Jaquet Droz's a programmable drawing automaton built in the 1770s using 6,000 moving parts, which was hand-coded. PDA-0 consists of RSSR (Revolute-Spherical-S-R) linkage and cam mechanisms with three interchangeable cams. Interchangeable cams make PDA-0 programmable because a user-specified 2D/3D trajectory is encoded into the set of three cams. The user programs PDA-0 by specifying a trajectory via a GUI or 3D animation. Subsequently, the compiler estimates a 3D trajectory mathematically from the user-specified 2D/3D trajectory and calculates the shape of the three cams, i.e., a code for PDA-0 by solving kinematic constraints. Finally, PDA-0 with the 3D-printed cams executes the code to draw the user-specified trajectory. The current PDA-0 with three cams demonstrates drawing simple trajectories such as letters and symbols.",

The aerial manipulator is particularly suitable for grasping in complex and narrow environment, in which traditional multi-rotor and helicopter would be inaccessible. The comprehensive integrated dynamic model is established by taking the aerial vehicle dynamics and manipulator dynamics as a whole. On this basis, a multilayer composite controller with feedforward compensation is designed, considering the mutual reactive influence between the aerial vehicle and the manipulator to improve the stability of the system under the motion of the manipulator. The simulation and actual flight tests verify the effectiveness of the design and show good stability and tracking performance of the system.",

In particular, we present the investigation of the effects of electrical stimulation patterns of ankle muscles synchronized in real-time with gait events., on the possible biomechanical alterations to gait in able-bodied individuals (n=8). Bilateral 3D ground reaction forces (GRF) were analyzed between barefoot overground walking with and without FES of ankle muscles.

The method has been tested systematically through high-fidelity simulations and in a wind tunnel emulating realistic conditions. The impact of multiple algorithmic and environmental parameters has been studied in the experiments. The algorithm shows good performance in various environmental conditions, particularly in high wind speeds and different source release rates.",

The antagonistic actuators together compose a bidirectional bending actuator with embedded capacitive strain sensors. By designing the SCAPAs from the ground-up for closed-loop control, we are able to minimize both the number of constituent components and the types of materials used, and further streamline the manufacturing processes. These improvements are embodied in the multipurpose use of a single conductive fabric sheet for both actuation and sensing, integrated into an otherwise all-silicone device. Such reduced material complexity allows us to use simple finite element analysis (FEA) models to predict the performance of a given design. We compare various designs to maximize sensor effectiveness using FEA and experimentally verify the suitability of select designs for state reconstruction. After converging on our final design, we demonstrate that this design evaluation process enables the use of simple control strategies to achieve closed-loop control.",

        "abstract": "Sensed information greatly helps a robot to adjust its motion or modulate the locomotory behavior. While many sensing components have been developed for macroscale robots, such off-the-shelf sensors are hardly integrated with a mesoscale (i.e., 0.1 mm to 10 mm) robot due to the size limitation. In this work, we propose a Compliant Mechanosensory Composite (CMC) to fabricate a small compliant mechanism with embedded sensing ability. As the first demonstration of CMC, we directly print a conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS onto the flexible joint of a compliant mechanism to sense the motion of the flexible joint itself. Owing to the variation of electric contact resistance (ECR) upon bending, the CMC could estimate its bending angle. The performance of the CMC was verified by analyzing the cyclic bending, transient and stationary response. Overall, a sparsely printed serpentine pattern with thicker line exhibited consistent response without a noticeable hysteresis. To demonstrate the applicability of the CMC process, a small gripper actuated by a SMA (shape memory alloy) coil was fabricated, and its motion was successfully measured using the embedded sensors. We expect the proposed CMC will enable a small robot to become sensible at its self motion, external load, and physical contacts in future.",

        "abstract": "We present the design of a new robotic human augmentation system that will assist the operator in carrying a heavy payload, reaching and maintaining difficult postures, and ultimately better performing their job. The Extra Robotic Legs (XRL) system is worn by the operator and consists of two articulated robotic legs that move with the operator to bear a heavy payload. The design was driven by a need to increase the effectiveness of hazardous material emergency response personnel who are encumbered by their personal protective equipment (PPE). The legs will ultimately walk, climb stairs, crouch down, and crawl with the operator while eliminating all external PPE loads on the operator. The forces involved in the most extreme loading cases were analyzed to find an effective strategy for reducing actuator loads. The analysis reveals that the maximum torque is exerted during the transition from the crawling to standing mode of motion. Peak torques are significantly reduced by leveraging redundancy in force application resulting from a closed-loop kinematic chain formed by a particular posture of the XRL. The actuators, power systems, and transmission elements were designed from the results of these analyses. Using differential mechanisms to combine the inputs of multiple actuators into a single degree of freedom, the gear reductions needed to bear the heavy loads could be kept at a minimum, enabling high bandwidth force control due to the near-direct-drive transmission. A prototype was fabricated utilizing the insights gained from these analyses and initial tests indicate the feasibility of the XRL system.",

According to the motor position, the joint module is classified into four types: the externally-actuated structure, the internally-coaxially-actuated structure, the internally-separately-actuated structure, and the hybrid-actuated structure. The four structures are analyzed and compared, and their implementation design examples are given. Experiments comparing the proposed joint module with directly-actuated traditional joint suggested that the 2M2D coupled tendon-driven joint module can obtain high control accuracy, and the torque reallocation via tendon coupling is effective to improve output torque. Additionally, an anthropomorphic robot arm with low weight and high payload was developed to show the utility of the proposed joint module.",

        "abstract": "Recent research on telepresence robots demonstrates that while they enable new heights of remote communication, there still exists challenges for both local and remote users in creating a connectedness one only encounters in face-to-face interactions. A large part of communication is beyond hearing and vision. Tangible interactions, expressive gestures, and physical referencing represent three of the primary social behaviors missing in the current telepresence experience. There is an inherent, subconscious quality to these physical actions that has been shown to allow more expressive and engaging communication. In this project we present the design, fabrication, and initial performance validation of a lightweight, ergonomic manipulator with a heavy, anthropomorphic end effector that enables gesturing capabilities for telepresence interactions.",

Traditional robots, sensors, and software often do not work reliably underground due to the harsh environment. This paper analyzes requirements and presents a robot design capable of navigating autonomously underground and manipulating objects with a robotic arm. The robot's base is a robust four wheeled platform powered by electric motors and able to withstand the harsh environment. It is equipped with color and depth cameras, lighting, laser scanners, an inertial measurement unit, and a robotic arm. We conducted two experiments testing mapping and autonomous navigation. Mapping a 75 meters long route including a loop closure results in a map that qualitatively matches the original map to a good extent. Testing autonomous driving on a previously created map of a second, straight, 150 meters long route was also successful. However, without loop closure, rotation errors cause apparent deviations in the created map. These first experiments showed the robot's operability underground.",

In this paper, we present a novel robotic ankle foot prosthesis with variable transmission series elastic actuator (SEA). Slider crank mechanism is applied to transform linear motion of series elastic actuator to rotary motion of ankle foot joint. And this could contribute to variable transmission ratio while ankle angle varies. Because of variable transmission ratio, ankle joint torque is increasing while ankle angle is flexed from plantar flexion to dorsiflexion, whose feature has similar increase trend with human's ankle joint torque-angle relationship, and exhibits an appropriate characteristic for developing robotic ankle foot prosthesis. Larger torque could be obtained in powered plantar flexion, and this indicates that variable transmission mechanism would help reduce required motor torque compared with traditional mechanism. Energy stored in springs of series elastic actuator contribute a torque to powered plantar flexion. Preliminary experiments with a transtibial amputee and a transferomal amputee have been performed to test the prototype.",

This paper seeks to redesign the topology of the tubes so that BTSR is decreased and the snapping problem is resolved in a particular tube set. The generated designs are then tested through finite element analysis as well as experimental testing to demonstrate the elimination of the snapping problem. Using this novel tube design on a concentric tube robotic system can increase its stable workspace because it allows the usage of greater tube curvatures and/or curve lengths.",

        "abstract": "Motion is a critical aspect of communication, required to create natural interactions between humans and robots. Robots for the classroom pose several constraints on motion, which make them challenging to design, including maintaining the safety of the child and the robot, responding in a timely fashion, and creating motions that are expressive and not scary. In this paper we present the mechanical design of a social robot and demonstrate that it is capable of safe motion within the proximity of children through analysis and empirical testing of the arms. The robot has a novel mechanical design for its two arms, which include torso-mounted, back-drivable, torque-limited stepper motors. The results suggest that our design succeeds at increasing safety levels while enabling the use of socially acceptable speeds of motion during the interaction. This study implies that the design of robotic agents for social interaction with children should consider the design of mechanical features that enable safe contact between the human and the robot while not limiting the robot to slow motions that would impair the timing of the interaction.",

        "abstract": "Robotic picking of folded objects such as books is required for picking various objects. As a folded object is easily unfolded, it is difficult to carry it stably and place it in a desired pose due to its dangling part. For overcoming this difficulty, we propose a trial-and-error picking system using our Suction Pinching Hand, which can push the dangling part up with pinch grasp until the object lifted with suction grasp is folded. That system utilizes proximity sensors on the hand to predict whether folding will succeed with a current hand pose and decide whether to retry with another pose. Also, proximity sensors, flex sensors and an air pressure sensor are used to deal with uncertainty of the image recognition, the hand hardware and suction grasp. We evaluate our proposed system with experiments of picking and placing folded objects. It is confirmed that our proposed system realizes picking with the ability of our Suction Pinching Hand to carry folded objects stably and place them in desired poses. It is also proved that our proposed system is robust against the uncertainty.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In the past decade many robots were deployed in the wild, and people detection and tracking is an important component of such deployments. On top of that, one often needs to run modules which analyze persons and extract higher level attributes such as age and gender, or dynamic information like gaze and pose. The latter ones are especially necessary for building a reactive, social robot-person interaction. In this paper, we combine those components in a fully modular detection-tracking-analysis pipeline, called DetTA. We investigate the benefits of such an integration on the example of head and skeleton pose, by using the consistent track ID for a temporal filtering of the analysis modules' observations, showing a slight improvement in a challenging real-world scenario. We also study the potential of a so-called \u201cfree-flight\u201d mode, where the analysis of a person attribute only relies on the filter's predictions for certain frames. Here, our study shows that this boosts the runtime dramatically, while the prediction quality remains stable. This insight is especially important for reducing power consumption and sharing precious (GPU-)memory when running many analysis components on a mobile platform, especially so in the era of expensive deep learning methods.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Swarm search and service (SSS) missions require large swarms to simultaneously search an area while servicing jobs as they are encountered. Jobs must be immediately serviced and can be one of several different job types - each requiring a different service time and number of vehicles to complete its service successfully. After jobs are serviced, vehicles are returned to the swarm and become available for reallocation. As part of SSS mission planning, human operators must determine the number of vehicles needed to achieve this balance. The complexities associated with balancing vehicle allocation to multiple as yet unknown tasks with returning vehicles makes this extremely difficult for humans. Previous work assumes that all system jobs are known ahead of time or that vehicles move independently of each other in a multi-agent framework. We present a dynamic vehicle routing (DVR) framework whose policies optimally allocate vehicles as jobs arrive. By incorporating time constraints into the DVR framework, an M/M/k/k queuing model can be used to evaluate overall steady state system performance for a given swarm size. Using these estimates, operators can rapidly compare system performance across different configurations, leading to more effective choices for swarm size. A sensitivity analysis is performed and its results are compared with the model, illustrating the appropriateness of our method to problems of plausible scale and complexity.",

There exists a tradeoff between a stable gait and an energy efficient gait. Our goal is to determine an energy efficient quadruped gait that will maintain stability while a human uses the device to stabilize themselves while walking. In order to determine an optimal gait, we present a cost function consisting of an energy term and a stability term. A method of evaluating the cost function using dynamics and quasi-static analysis is demonstrated.

While this is a good starting point, in our work with concrete application fields we encounter that culture in its usual definition as national culture (e.g. [2]; [3]) is too general a concept to be useful in these concrete applications. Thus, we shifted our focus instead to a concept of local cultural practices, which is derived from situated practices as in Wengers communities of practice [4] and grounded loosely in Sperbers idea of an epidemiology of representations [5], i.e. culture or rather cultural practices as an emergent phenomenon from learning processes in a given group. Developing this new kind of culture-aware robots can then not start from a general definition of culture like Hofstede [2], Schwartz and Sagiv [6], etc. but has to take the actual group of users (and stakeholders) into account. We exemplify this approach with our work in a residency for citizens with acquired brain damage.",

To achieve the desired objectives, the EAMA system design should guarantee that the robot can stably run in the harsh environments of high temperature (80-120 \u00b0C) and high vacuum (~ 10-5Pa). Meanwhile, the errors caused by the deformation of long flexible robot arms should also be predicted and compensated in real-time to obtain high accuracy for maintenance operations. In this paper, the vacuum-available design scheme of the manipulator system was firstly introduced. Secondly, inverse kinematics and obstacle avoidance strategy of the highly redundant EAMA robot was built. Then, flexible errors were predicted utilizing a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model which was established on the basis of real experimental data. Finally, an integrated control strategy for error prediction and compensation was developed.",

In this paper, a new flexible interface is proposed to intuitively map human bending commands into movements of the growing robot while providing shape information of the robot in order to improve situational awareness. Several command mappings are proposed, and a subjective study was conducted to assess the intuitiveness of the developed interface and mappings compared with other commercially available interfaces. The interfaces were evaluated using four metrics in two virtual task scenarios. The proposed interface with shape mapping performed better than the other interfaces, especially when the vine robot rolls over unintentionally during complex tasks.",

        "abstract": "In clinical practice, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to locate a lesion/tumor for bone biopsy in children. However, there is a lack of MR-compatible tools that can be used simultaneously during imaging and biopsy while maintaining surgical accuracy and safety. The Pediatric Surgery Robot (PSR) platform is a 5-DOF robot with a modular tool interface. For the case of bone biopsy, a Bone Biopsy Tooling (BBT) is attached. It is designed to fit within a Philips Achieva 3.0T MRI bore and carry a modified titanium bone biopsy needle. A surgical pre-planning and control interface has been developed for joint and Cartesian level control. The PSR-BBT has demonstrated 1.65 +/- 1.77 mm accuracy in Cartesian control in free space. The PSR-BBT can generate 12.46 +/- 0.32 N of axial force while drilling at a speed of 30 rpm, which is sufficient for cortical and cancellous bone phantoms. Under MRI testing (T1-FFE, T1-SE, T2-FFE and T2-TSE scans), the system demonstrated less than 33% signal-to-noise ratio variation while drilling and a 0.46% geometric distortion while powered on without significantly impacting MRI guidance in situ. These results show that the PSR-BBT can allow the user to simultaneously image and perform the biopsy and presents the PSR as a viable platform for MR-guided robotic surgery.",

The camber-flat wing structure convert mechanism makes MAV flight using asymmetric flapping pattern through control of angle of attack without complicate structure. This mechanism was inspired from the dragonfly's feature that the camber structure of the wing increases the rigidity of wing structure and makes dragonfly has asymmetric flapping pattern. Experimental results show that MAV has asymmetric flapping pattern that can more stable flight performance when hovering flight with a camber structure and superior performance when the forward flight with a flat structure. The average lift force in the camber wing structure was 0.02N, the average thrust force was 0.02N and the average lift force was 0.011N in the flat wing structure at 20 Hz flapping frequency.",

Therefore, to inspect sewer pipes, we developed a peristaltic crawling robot that reproduces the locomotion of an earthworm. This robot can drive for more than 100m, and it can be used for the maintenance of sewer pipes (100A pipes). However, the speed of the robot is low. There are two causes. First, the units of the previous robot have steps of artificial muscle fastening. These steps increase the diameter of the artificial muscles. A smaller diameter of the artificial muscles is advantageous for the speed of the robot inside the pipes. Second, the previous robot has slow air response. In this study, we used large-sized solenoid valves to overcome this drawback.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, a dual-arm robot system for high-speed manipulations, which is named LIMS2-AMBIDEX and is developed to compete in the IROS2018 Robotic Challenge, is presented. It has two seven-degrees-of-freedom (DO FF) lightweight arms, a three-DOF head, and a one-DOF gripper to manipulate foldable objects. Because all the heavy actuators are placed at the shoulder, it has remarkably low mass beyond the shoulder (2.63 kg), which guarantees an inherent safety at high speeds. Utilizing tension-amplification mechanisms, the high stiffness and strength are achieved, and thus it has the control performance comparable to conventional industrial manipulators. A unique three-DOF wrist mechanism, whose motions directly represent the quaternion values of the joint orientation, can manipulate objects without singular points in the entire range of motion. In order to utilize the object's inertia during rapid manipulation, the gripper was specially designed: it has a one-DOF finger to grasp the upper rib of the foldable fan and two supporting forks to grasp the bottom rib stably. For real-time performance and increased scalability, a software framework was developed based on Robot Operating System (ROS). The real-time capability is achieved by using the real-time development framework Xenomai and the high-speed communication protocol EtherCAT. As most of the algorithms are implemented in the distributed nodes using ROS, it is convenient to expand, improve, and replace the algorithms. Consequentially, the entire motion of the Fan Robotic Challenge Phase I Modality B required 1.05 s, which is substantially faster than a similar manipulation by most humans.",

        "abstract": "Motor skill learning is fundamental in many physical activities of human. In the processes of learning of motor skills, learners often receive visual or physical information about postures from teachers. However, the information about postures usually cannot be transmitted precisely. In this paper, we propose a motion teaching system to transmit teachers' motion to learners directly by using a motion capture and an assist suit. The assist suit, which has a pneumatic artificial rubber muscle (PARM) as an actuator, was designed to move a learner's hip joint with less loss of assistive force and less constraint of motion. Hip joint motion of a teacher can be transmitted to the assist suit by master-slave control. In addition, to compensate the delay of the PARM, posture of the teacher is predicted before the occurence by a recurrent neural network by using electromyogram signals and the past joint angle. We confirmed the system can transmit a teacher's motion to a learner in real time, and with the neural network, the delay of the learner's motion could be suppressed to approximately 0.1s, which is enough to feel visual and physical information synchronous. Therefore, the proposed motion teaching system would have the ability to transmit teachers' motion to learners visually and physically with precision sufficient to facilitate skill transmission.",

Our rimless wheel achieves level-ground walking by simply controlling the wobbling mass attached to the wheel. We mathematically demonstrate that the controlled wobbling mass generates propulsive effects for the rimless wheel. The walking speed of the rimless wheel can be changed by varying the amplitude of the wobbling mass: thus slow walking to high-speed walking can be realized for the wheel. Moreover, we have developed a robot based on a rimless wheel to show effectiveness of our proposed methods. We then analyze the walking properties with respect to the physical parameters and control parameters of our robot through numerical simulation.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel mobile robot developed to perform Curling sports is introduced. The developed robot is a Stone Throwing Robot (STR) for Curling that can travel on the ice with wheels and throw a stone as well as make curls of the stone. The STR is developed as a robot component of an Artificial Intelligence(AI) system that can autonomously play the curling sport. The proposed STR can throw a stone at any desired speed and in any desired direction, which are determined by the AI system. To achieve this precise driving of the STR and throwing of the stone, two dimensional drive control is developed for the STR, which consists of 1) anti-slip control for high traction, 2) precise velocity control and 3) high accuracy heading angle control. In addition to the conventional PID controller, model-based feedforward control, Model Following Control (MFC) for the anti-slip control of the wheel on the ice and Yaw Moment Observer (YMO) for the robust heading angle control are applied as key technologies for the STR driving. The design configurations of the STR to achieve the detection of its own location and throwing/curling of the stone is proposed in this paper as well as the detail of the precise driving control.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a lightweight (<;250 g) and low-cost (<;350 USD) biomimetic prosthetic hand with two actuators embedded in the palm. One of them is employed for flexion/extension of the five digits, and the other one is used for the adduction/abduction of thumb. Thus, the hand can achieve major grasping tasks that account for about 85% of activities in daily life. The unique transmission provides various advantages such as a compact structure, weight saving, and short driven distance. Furthermore, by using 3D printing technology, most parts of the prosthetic hand were made to be much lighter and have a humanlike appearance, compared with conventionally manufactured artificial hand. Finally, the performance and practical applicability of the proposed design was verified experimentally through both of a motion verification and an intuitive control test by a healthy subject and a transradial amputee.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a high-quality wide-angle fovea lens, i.e., the WAF lens, for the autonomous robot's and vehicle's super-sensing vision system. The WAF lens is well-known in the field of robotic vision with respect to its unique design concept, biologically-inspired from a visual system of the primates. The WAF lens achieves the following two conflicting properties in imaging simultaneously: (1) wide field of view (FOV) and (2) high magnification factor (although only the central FOV achieves it partially). In this paper, the authors designs the WAF lens for the high-resolution photosensitive imaging chip more than 3M pixels. For this design, we decide the following targets on the assumption of applying this WAF lens for the stereo vision system: (1) The WAF lens can measure a very far distance over 100m ahead from the imager accurately. (2) The WAF lens can observe approximately 100-degree wide FOV on the same time. We produce a prototype of this WAF lens with much higher optical performance than our previous developments. The compound system of the prototype includes four aspherical surfaces in its front part to project enough bright images so that the WAF lens is available not only at daytime but also in dark situations at night. The authors experiment and demonstrate the projection tests using the prototype, and discuss about the results as the inspection of this challenging development.",

        "abstract": "For decades, various robotic grippers have been developed due to its necessity for the robotic manipulators. In case of the conventional robotic grippers with rigid components, an underactuated mechanism was required to satisfy gripping motion. Recently, soft grippers have been studied actively, which have realize bending motion with a simple morphological structure itself and inherent compliance to the environment. In this field of study, it has been rarely investigated to improve the fingertip force and actuation speed with specified design parameters. Thus, in this study, a hybrid gripper, which consists of both soft and rigid components, was suggested based on the key design principles: 1) the ratio of rigid parts against the soft chamber, 2) the cross-sectional shape of the chamber. The suggested principles were verified using the finite element methods (FEMs). As a result, the improved performance of the hybrid gripper was verified in terms of the fingertip force and the actuation speed, compared with the performance of the previously developed soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs). As an application, the three-fingered gripper was manufactured and tested by grasping different types of objects.",

As a platform for swimming research, we have developed a musculoskeletal humanoid robot called Triton. Triton has a flexible spine with erector spinae muscles and a stiffness adjustment system for lumbar joints. The musculoskeletal body includes biarticular and polyarticular muscles, providing multi-joint coordination. The robot is actuated by pneumatic muscles, yielding lightweight and inherently waterproof properties. The compliance of the joints allows interactions between body and fluid similar to those of human swimming. This study presents the design concept of Triton and experimental results from a water tank test. We compare the results with simulation and human movements reported in literature. The results show that the musculoskeletal swimming robot has similar cycle trends in joint angle and thrust force.",

First, we propose a flexible angle estimation sensor. This sensor measures the change in the amount of light passing through polyurethane material and estimates the angle with high repeatability. Next, we design a flexible finger that makes this sensor easy to incorporate. The flexible fingers are produced with a multi-material 3D printer that can use flexible material. The flexible finger can accommodate the proposed flexible sensor within it. It is possible to place the sensor's signal line in the air pressure pipeline. Because the flexible finger is produced with a 3D printer, variations in each model's characteristics are small as compared with manufacturing through molding. In this paper, we show an improvement of positional accuracy in the proposed flexible finger using angle feedback control from the proposed sensor. The effectiveness of this sensor is also shown to solve the problem of vibration problems for the flexible finger during high speed motion.",

        "abstract": "There has been an increasing interest in mobile manipulators that are capable of performing physical work in living spaces worldwide, corresponding to an aging population with declining birth rates with the expectation of improving quality of life (QoL). Research and development is a must in intelligent sensing and software which will enable advanced recognition, judgment, and motion to realize household work by robots. In order to accelerate this research, we have developed a compact and safe research platform, Human Support Robot (HSR), which can be operated in an actual home environment. We assume that overall R&D will accelerate by using a common robot platform among many researchers since that enables them to share their research results. Currently, the number of HSR users is expanding to 33 sites in 8 countries worldwide (as of February 15, 2018). Software and technical knowledge of all users is shared through a community website. HSR has been adopted as a standard platform for international robot competitions such as RoboCup@Home and World Robot Summit (WRS). HSR is provided to participants of those competitions through public offering. In this paper, we describe HSR's development background, and technical detail of its hardware and software. Specifically, we describe its omnidirectional mobile base using the dual-wheel caster-drive mechanism, which is the basis of HSR's operational movement and a novel whole body motion control system. Finally, we describe the results of utilization in RoboCup@Home and field tests in order to demonstrate the effect of introducing the platform.",

This graph is used to plan a sequence of manipulation primitives so to bring the object to the desired end pose. This sequence of primitives is translated into motions of the robot to move the object held by the end-effector. We use a dual arm robot with parallel grippers to test our method on a real system and show successful planning and execution of in-hand manipulation.",

        "abstract": "Robots often have to deal with the challenges of operating in dynamic and sometimes unpredictable environments. Although an occupancy map of the environment is sufficient for navigation of a mobile robot or manipulation tasks with a robotic arm in static environments, robots operating in dynamic environments demand richer information to improve robustness, efficiency, and safety. For instance, in path planning, it is important to know the direction of motion of dynamic objects at various locations of the environment for safer navigation or human-robot interaction. In this paper, we introduce directional statistics into robotic mapping to model circular data. Primarily, in collateral to occupancy grid maps, we propose directional grid maps to represent the location-wide long-term angular motion of the environment. Being highly representative, this defines a probability measure-field over the longitude-latitude space rather than a scalar-field or a vector-field. Withal, we further demonstrate how the same theory can be used to model angular variations in the spatial domain, temporal domain, and spatiotemporal domain. We carried out a series of experiments to validate the proposed models using a variety of robots having different sensors such as RGB cameras and LiDARs on simulated and real-world settings in both indoor and outdoor environments.",

        "abstract": "Physical connectors with self-aligning geometry aid in the docking process for many robotic and automatic control systems such as robotic self-reconfiguration and air-to-air refueling. This self-aligning geometry provides a wider range of acceptable error tolerance in relative pose between the two rigid objects, increasing successful docking chances. We present a new method for computing the error range (or area of acceptance) for a pair of rigid connector objects with self-aligning geometry capable of higher dimensional analysis which was previously limited to three. The method is based on the configuration space obstacle model, which gives us a representation of the space of contact states between the two objects. Using an approach direction as analogous to gravity, and assuming the target docked configuration is stable, the set of misaligned points that lead to docking is the target configuration's watershed for an arbitrarily dimensioned configuration space obstacle. It is well known that the watershed of a height map on a discrete grid can be found using any number of algorithms from image segmentation. We present an implementation based on Meyer's flooding algorithm to determine this watershed and measure the AA for simple connectors in 2D and 3D. Results are presented for systems including unconstrained motion in SE(2) and motion constrained to four dimensions (ie. x,y,z,pitch) in SE(3).",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Sliding window approaches have been widely used for object recognition tasks in recent years [19], [4], [5], [18]. They guarantee an investigation of the entire input image for the object to be detected and allow a localization of that object. Despite the current trend towards deep neural networks, sliding window methods are still used in combination with convolutional neural networks [22]. The risk of overlooking an object is clearly reduced compared to alternative detection approaches which detect objects based on shape, edges or color. Nevertheless, the sliding window technique strongly increases the computational effort as the classifier has to verify a large number of object candidates. This paper proposes a sliding window approach which also uses depth information from a stereo camera. This leads to a greatly decreased number of object candidates without significantly reducing the detection accuracy. A theoretical investigation of the conventional sliding window approach is presented first. Other publications to date only mentioned rough estimations of the computational cost. A mathematical derivation clarifies the number of object candidates with respect to parameters such as image and object size. Subsequently, the proposed disparity sliding window approach is presented in detail. The approach is evaluated on pedestrian detection with annotations and images from the KITTI [10] object detection benchmark. Furthermore, a comparison with two state-of-the-art methods is made. Code is available in C++ and Python https://github.com/julimueller/disparity-sliding-window.",

In this paper, we propose a novel structure, where the objective is to achieve navigation in large-scale indoor complex environment without pre-constructed map. Generally, it requires good understanding of such indoor environment to make complex spatial perception possible, especially when the indoor space consists of many walls and doors which might block the view of robot leading to complex navigation path. By the proposed distributed deep reinforcement learning in different local regions, our method can achieve indoor visual navigation in the aforementioned large-scale environment without extra map information and human instruction. In the experiments, we validate our proposed method by conducting highly promising navigation tasks both in simulation and real environments.",

We first model the forest fire as a Markov decision process (MDP) with a factored structure. We consider optimally controlling the forest fire without agents using dynamic programming, and show any exact solution and many approximate solutions are computationally intractable. Given the problem complexity, we consider a deep RL approach in which each agent learns a policy requiring only local information. We show with Monte Carlo simulations that the deep RL policy outperforms a hand-tuned heuristic, and scales well for various forest sizes and different numbers of UAVs as well as variations in model parameters. Experimental demonstrations with mobile robots fighting a simulated forest fire in the Robotarium at the Georgia Institute of Technology are also presented.",

This skin used a network of 22 nodes that performed in situ computation and communication of data collected from 74 pressure sensors, which were embedded into the skin panels of an ultra-lightweight 14-foot wingspan made from commutable, lattice-based subcomponents, and tested at NASA Langley Research Center's 14X22 wind tunnel. The density of the pressure sensors allowed for the use of a novel distributed algorithm to generate estimates of the wing lift contribution that were more accurate than the direct integration of the pressure distribution over the wing surface.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the combination of temporal logic (TL) specifications and local objective functions to create online, multiagent, motion plans. These plans are guaranteed to satisfy a persistent mission TL specification and locally optimize an objective function (e.g. in this paper, a cost based on information entropy). The presented approach decouples the two tasks by assigning sub-teams of agents to fulfill the TL specification, while unassigned agents optimize the objective function locally. This paper also presents a novel decoupling of the classic product automaton based approach while maintaining satisfaction guarantees. We also qualitatively show that optimality loss in the local greedy minimization due to the TL constraints can be approximated based on specification complexity. This approach is evaluated with a set of simulations and an experiment of 6 robots with real sensors.",

        "abstract": "We propose a distributionally robust incremental sampling-based method for kinodynamic motion planning under uncertainty, which we call distributionally robust RRT (DR-RRT). In contrast to many approaches that assume Gaussian distributions for uncertain parameters, here we consider moment-based ambiguity sets of distributions with given mean and covariance. Chance constraints for obstacle avoidance and internal state bounds are then enforced under the worst-case distribution in the ambiguity set, which gives a coherent assessment of constraint violation risks. The method generates risk-bounded trajectories and feedback control laws for robots operating in dynamic, cluttered, and uncertain environments, explicitly incorporating localization error, stochastic process disturbances, unpredictable obstacle motion, and uncertain obstacle location. We show that the algorithm is probabilistically complete under mild assumptions. Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.",

        "abstract": "The motivation of the work presented here is to create a component of a safety system based on 3D lidar sensors, specifically for industrial environments where some rules can be set for people who will be in close proximity to working robots. Specifically, the operating procedure that is put in place in the workplace is that all people must wear the provided high visibility clothing, which has retro-reflective strips attached. It is shown here that the retro-reflective strips provide a strong cue for pedestrian detection in the intensity data from a lidar sensor within a range of 4 metres. We present and compare multiple methods of exploiting this cue and provide a recommendation for how a safety system should be architected in order to best exploit the lidar intensity data in combination with more common approaches for detection of objects from the lidar range data. Amongst these detection methods is the use of neural networks, which present challenges for key components of standardized safety system development-in particular, for programming methodology control, interpretability of testing and diagnostic coverage. We propose methods for how to start to address these challenges and how to integrate neural networks into safety systems.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning-based robotic grasping has made significant progress thanks to algorithmic improvements and increased data availability. However, state-of-the-art models are often trained on as few as hundreds or thousands of unique object instances, and as a result generalization can be a challenge. In this work, we explore a novel data generation pipeline for training a deep neural network to perform grasp planning that applies the idea of domain randomization to object synthesis. We generate millions of unique, unrealistic procedurally generated objects, and train a deep neural network to perform grasp planning on these objects. Since the distribution of successful grasps for a given object can be highly multimodal, we propose an autoregressive grasp planning model that maps sensor inputs of a scene to a probability distribution over possible grasps. This model allows us to sample grasps efficiently at test time (or avoid sampling entirely). We evaluate our model architecture and data generation pipeline in simulation and the real world. We find we can achieve a >90% success rate on previously unseen realistic objects at test time in simulation despite having only been trained on random objects. We also demonstrate an 80% success rate on real-world grasp attempts despite having only been trained on random simulated objects.",

Flow-aware planning aims to plan trajectories that adhere to existing flow motion patterns in the environment, with the goal to make robots more efficient, less intrusive and safer. We use a statistical model called CLiFF-map that can map flow patterns for both continuous media and discrete objects. We propose novel cost and biasing functions for an RRT* planning algorithm, which exploits all the information available in the CLiFF-map model, including uncertainties due to flow variability or partial observability. Qualitatively, a benefit of our approach is that it can also be tuned to yield trajectories with different qualities such as exploratory or cautious, depending on application requirements. Quantitatively, we demonstrate that our approach produces more flow-compliant trajectories, compared to two baselines.",

        "abstract": "Machines with high levels of autonomy such as robots and our growing need to interact with them creates challenges to ensure safe operation. The recent interest to create autonomous vehicles through the integration of control and decision-making systems makes such vehicles robots too. We therefore applied estimation and decision-making mechanisms currently investigated for human-robot interaction to human-vehicle interaction. In other words, we define the vehicle as an autonomous agent with which the human driver interacts, and focus on understanding the human intentions and decision-making processes. These are then integrated into the ro-bot`s/vehicle's own control and decision-making system not only to understand human behaviour while it occurs but to predict the next actions. To obtain knowledge about the human's intentions, this work relies heavily on the use of motion tracking data (i.e. skeletal tracking, body posture)gathered from drivers whilst driving. We use a data-driven approach to both classify current driving manoeuvres and predict future manoeuvres, by using a fixed prediction window and augmenting a standard set of manoeuvres. Results are validated against drivers of different sizes, seat preferences and levels of driving expertise to evaluate the robustness of the methods; precision and recall metrics higher than 95% for manoeuvre classification and 90% for manoeuvre prediction with time-windows of up to 1.3 seconds are obtained. The idea of prediction adds a highly novel aspect to human-robot/human-vehicle interaction, allowing for decision and control at a later point.",

        "abstract": "Obstacle avoidance is a key feature for safe Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigation. While solutions have been proposed for static obstacle avoidance, systems enabling avoidance of dynamic objects, such as drones, are hard to implement due to the detection range and field-of-view (FOV) requirements, as well as the constraints for integrating such systems on-board small UAVs. In this work, a dataset of 6k synthetic depth maps of drones has been generated and used to train a state-of-the-art deep learning-based drone detection model. While many sensing technologies can only provide relative altitude and azimuth of an obstacle, our depth map-based approach enables full 3D localization of the obstacle. This is extremely useful for collision avoidance, as 3D localization of detected drones is key to perform efficient collision-free path planning. The proposed detection technique has been validated in several real depth map sequences, with multiple types of drones flying at up to 2 m/s, achieving an average precision of 98.7 %, an average recall of 74.7 % and a record detection range of 9.5 meters.",

In this paper, we present a dual-arm coordinated motion planning and compliance control method with a unique null-space projected relative Jacobian and relative operational force between the two arms. The proposed method is able to plan dual-arm capturing motion and control the capturing force without disturbing the tracking motion. We have also adopted a direct collocation trajectory optimization method to generate optimal trajectory to decrease the object's momentum with minimum effort. Simulation and experiment of dual-arm robots picking up a moving box on a mobile platform are carried out to verify the proposed method.",

The robot dynamics are simplified to formulate the problem as convex optimization while still capturing the full 3D nature of the system. With the simplified model, ground reaction force planning problems are formulated for prediction horizons of up to 0.5 seconds, and are solved to optimality in under 1 ms at a rate of 20-30 Hz. Despite using a simplified model, the robot is capable of robust locomotion at a variety of speeds. Experimental results demonstrate control of gaits including stand, trot, flying-trot, pronk, bound, pace, a 3-legged gait, and a full 3D gallop. The robot achieved forward speeds of up to 3 m/s, lateral speeds up to 1 m/s, and angular speeds up to 180 deg/sec. Our approach is general enough to perform all these behaviors with the same set of gains and weights.",

        "abstract": "One of the most concerning and costly problems in hospitals is patients falls. We address this problem by introducing PAM, a patient assistant mobile robot, that maneuvers mobility aids to assist with fall prevention. Common objects found inside hospitals include objects with legs (i.e. walkers, tables, chairs, equipment stands). For a mobile robot operating in such environments, safely maneuvering these objects without collision is essential. Since providing the robot with dynamic models of all possible legged objects that may exist in such environments is not feasible, autonomous learning of an approximate dynamic model for these objects would significantly improve manipulation planning. We describe a probabilistic method to do this by fitting pre-categorized object models learned from minimal force and motion interactions with an object. In addition, we account for multiple manipulation strategies, which requires a hybrid control system comprised of discrete grasps on legs and continuous applied forces. To do this, we use a simple one-wheel point-mass model. A hybrid MPC-based manipulation planning algorithm was developed to compensate for modeling errors. While the proposed algorithm applies to a broad range of legged objects, we only show results for the case of a 2-wheel, 4-legged walker in this paper. Simulation and experimental tests show that the obtained dynamic model is sufficiently accurate for safe and collision-free manipulation. When combined with the proposed manipulation planning algorithm, the robot can successfully move the object to a desired position without collision.",

Three different working modes named Drive Mode, Inchworm Mode and Scoot Mode are proposed to enable the robot to move forward together with the object. We firstly introduce a universal model for these modes and deduce its dynamic equation. Then the contact force constraints are combined and mapped to the system state variables. Based on the acquired state acceleration constraints, the motion planning problem can be solved by designing system state paths in the phase space. After that, we described the mathematical problems within the three working modes and generate the robot motions accordingly.

        "abstract": "Distribution-to-distribution normal distributions transform (NDT-D2D) is one of the fast point set registrations. Since the normal distributions transform (NDT) is a set of normal distributions generated by discrete and regular cells, local minima of the objective function is an issue of NDT-D2D. Also, we found that the objective function based on L2 distance between distributions has a negative correlation with rotational alignment. To overcome the problems, we present a method using dynamic scaling factors of covariances to improve the accuracy of NDT-D2D. Two scaling factors are defined for the preceding and current NDTs respectively, and they are dynamically varied in each iteration of NDT-D2D. We implemented the proposed method based on conventional NDT-D2D and probabilistic NDT-D2D and compared to the NDT-D2D with fixed scaling factors using KITTI benchmark data set. Also, we experimented estimating odometry with an initial guess as an application of distribution-to-distribution probabilistic NDT (PNDT-D2D) with the proposed method. As a result, the proposed method improves both translational and rotational accuracy of the NDT-D2D and PNDT-D2D.",

Our edge detection method evaluates symmetry in a local neighborhood and uses an adaptive density based threshold to differentiate 3D edge points. We extend this algorithm to propose a novel corner detector that clusters curvature vectors and uses their geometrical statistics to classify a point as corner. We perform rigorous evaluation of the algorithms on RGB-D semantic segmentation and 3D washer models from the ShapeNet dataset and report higher precision and recall scores. Finally, we also demonstrate how our edge and corner detectors can be used as a novel approach towards automatic weld seam detection for robotic welding. We propose to generate weld seams directly from a point cloud as opposed to using 3D models for offline planning of welding paths. For this application, we show a comparison between Harris 3D and our proposed approach on a panel workpiece.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an edge-based robust RGB-D visual odometry (VO) using 2-D edge divergence minimization. Our approach focuses on enabling the VO to operate in more general environments subject to low texture and changing brightness, by employing image edge regions and their image gradient vectors within the iterative closest points (ICP) framework. For more robust and stable ICP-based optimization, we propose a robust edge matching criterion with image gradient vectors. In addition, to reduce a bad effect of outlier residuals, we propose an improved edge registration problem of 2-D edge divergence minimization in the manner of an iterative re-weight least squares (IRLS) motion estimation. To accelerate the proposed approach, a pixel sub-sampling method is employed. We evaluate estimation performance of our method in changing brightness conditions and low-textured scenes. Our approach shows more robust motion estimation than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining comparable accuracy in challenging image sequences at real-time (25 Hz) operation.",

We implemented an intent recognition system to recognize the human partner's hand motion intent and a motion planner system to enable the robot to communicate its intent by using legible and predictable motion. We tested this bi-directional intent system in a 2-way within-subjects user study. Results suggest that an integrated intent recognition and communication system may facilitate more collaborative behavior among team members.",

To tackle the aforementioned issues, we introduce invariably safe sets. These are regions that allow vehicles to remain safe for an infinite time horizon. We show how invariably safe sets can be computed and propose a tight under-approximation which can be obtained efficiently in linear time with respect to the number of traffic participants. We use invariably safe sets to lift safety verification from finite to infinite time horizons. In addition, our sets can be used to determine the existence of feasible evasive maneuvers and the criticality of scenarios by computing the time-to-react metric.",

In this paper, we present a system which efficiently computes the torque of distributed skin cells locally at the point of contacts, completely removing this complex computations from the real-time loop. We demonstrate the feasibility of realizing the skin joint torque computations on the local micro-controllers of the skin cells. Conducting experiments with a real robot, we compare the accuracy of the distributed skin joint torque computation with the computation on the control PC. We also show that the novel distributed approach completely eliminates the computational delay of computing skin joint torques in the robot's real-time control loop. As a result, this approach removes any limits for the maximum number of skin cells in control.",

This paper proposes a full SLAM system capable of handling the dynamics of the environment across a single or multiple mapping sessions. Using the pose graph SLAM paradigm, the system works on local maps in the form of 2D point cloud data which are updated over time to store the most up-to-date state of the environment. The core of our system is an efficient ICP-based alignment and merging procedure working on the clouds that copes with non-static entities of the environment. Furthermore, the system retains the graph complexity by removing out-dated nodes upon robust inter- and intra-session loop closure detections while graph coherency is preserved by using condensed measurements. Experiments conducted with real data from longterm SLAM datasets demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy and effectiveness of our system in the management of the mapping problem during long-term robot operation.",

        "abstract": "Efficient 2D and 3D map representations of both static and dynamic, indoor and outdoor environments are crucial for navigation of driving and flying robots. In this paper, we propose a fast and accurate approach for 2D and 3D Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) mapping based on indexed kd-trees. Similar to other approaches, we also model free space, which allows us to obtain occupancy probabilities. Additionally, we provide optional visibility based updates to enhance map consistency in case of noisy data, e.g. from stereo cameras. Unlike other available implementations, our approach is natively applicable to large-scale environments and in real-time, because our maps are able to grow dynamically. This also offers applicability to exploration tasks. To evaluate our approach, we present experimental results on publicly available datasets and discuss the mapping efficiency in terms of accuracy, runtime and memory management. As an exemplary use case, we apply our maps to Monte Carlo Localization on a well-known large-scale dataset.",

Key features include the use of an off-the-shelf physics engine and the Bayesian optimization framework. The task being considered is locomotion with a high-dimensional, compliant Tensegrity robot. A key insight, in this case, is the need to project the space of models into an appropriate lower dimensional space for time efficiency. Comparisons with alternatives indicate that the proposed method can identify the parameters more accurately within the given time budget, which also results in more precise locomotion control.",

The method comprises three main steps. Given a single RGB-D image, we first deploy appropriate features and the random forest to deduce the object class probability and cast votes for the 6D pose in Hough space by joint regression and classification framework, adopting reservoir sampling and summarizing the pose distribution by clustering. Next, we integrate the auto-context into cascaded Hough forests to improve the efficiency of learning. Extensive experiments on various public datasets and robotic grasps indicate that our method presents some improvements over the state-of-art and reveals the capability for estimating poses in practical applications efficiently.",

Combining an accurate model of multi-body dynamic system with Bayesian filtering methods has been shown to be able to filter out noise from the object's observed states. However, efficiency of these filtering methods suffers from samples that violate the physical constraints, e.g., no penetration constraint. In this paper, we propose a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) that samples the contact states and updates the object's poses using Kalman filters. This RBPF also enforces the physical constraints on the samples by solving a quadratic programming problem. By comparing our method with methods that does not consider physical constraints, we show that our proposed RBPF is not only able to estimate the object's states, e.g., poses, more accurately but also able to infer unobserved states, e.g., velocities, with higher precision.",

        "abstract": "Motion planners have been recently developed that provide path quality guarantees for robots with dynamics. This work aims to improve upon their efficiency, while maintaining their properties. Inspired by informed search principles, one objective is to use heuristics. Nevertheless, comprehensive and fast spatial exploration of the state space is still important in robotics. For this reason, this work introduces Dominance-Informed Regions (DIR), which express both whether parts of the space are unexplored and whether they lies along a high quality path. Furthermore, to speed up the generation of a successful successor state, which involves collision checking or physics-based simulation, a proposed strategy generates the most promising successor in an informed way, while maintaing properties. Overall, this paper introduces a new informed and asymptotically optimal kinodynamic motion planner, the Dominance-Informed Region Tree (DIRT). The method balances exploration-exploitation tradeoffs without many explicit parameters. It is shown to outperform sampling-based and search-based methods for robots to significant dynamics.",

        "abstract": "Visual odometry methods are increasingly being used to estimate a vehicle's ego-motion from range data due to the decreasing cost of range sensors and the impressive speed and accuracy of visual odometry techniques. Dense geometry-based visual odometry methods are fundamentally based on the range flow constraint equation, an equation which depends on the temporal and spatial derivatives of range images. However, these derivatives are calculated with the fundamental assumption that the range flow is magnitude-limited. When scaling this method for faster vehicles, this assumption could be violated, invaliding the range flow constraint equation and thus corrupting the resulting ego-motion estimates. This paper derives the sensor, motion, environment, and sampling frequency conditions that would mathematically violate the range flow constraint. This information is useful for defining the operational limits of dense geometry-based visual odometry methods.",

We introduce an integrated deep neural network architecture for modeling ESM. It learns to estimate the occupancy state of the world and progressively construct top-down 2D global maps from egocentric views in a spatially extended environment. During the exploration, our proposed ESM model updates belief of the global map based on local observations using a recurrent neural network. It also augments the local mapping with a novel external memory to encode and store latent representations of the visited places over longterm exploration in large environments which enables agents to perform place recognition and hence, loop closure. Our proposed ESM network contributes in the following aspects: (1) without feature engineering, our model predicts free space based on egocentric views efficiently in an end-to-end manner; (2) different from other deep learning-based mapping system, ESMN deals with continuous actions and states which is vitally important for robotic control in real applications. In the experiments, we demonstrate its accurate and robust global mapping capacities in 3D virtual mazes and realistic indoor environments by comparing with several competitive baselines.",

It reveals a remarkable stiffness and damping range in the experimental evaluation. The most interesting contribution, is the way the desired closed-loop dynamics is designed. Our control concept allows to add a desired stiffness and damping directly on the end-effector, while leaving the system structure intact. The intrinsic inertial and elastic properties of the system are preserved. This is achieved by introducing new motor coordinates that reflect the desired spring and damper terms. Theoretically, by means of additional motor inertia shaping it is possible to make the end-effector interaction behavior with respect to external loads approach, arbitrarily close, the interaction behavior that is achievable by classical Cartesian impedance control on rigid robots. The physically motivated design approach allows for an intuitive understanding of the resulting closed-loop dynamics. We perform a passivity and stability analysis on the basis of al physically motivated storage and Lyapunov function.",

        "abstract": "Among the diversity of the existing modular robotic systems, we consider in this paper the subset of distributed modular robotic ensembles composed of resource-constrained identical modules that are organized in a lattice structure and which can only communicate with neighboring modules. These modular robotic ensembles form asynchronous distributed embedded systems. In many algorithms dedicated to distributed system coordination, a specific role has to be played by a leader, i.e., a single node in the system. This leader can be elected using various criteria. A possible strategy is to elect a center node, i.e., a node that has the minimum distance to all the other nodes. Indeed, this node is ideally located to communicate with all the others and this leads to better performance in many algorithms. The contribution of this paper is to propose the k-BFS SumSweep algorithm designed to elect an approximate-center node. We evaluated our algorithm both on hardware modular robots and in a simulator for large ensembles of robots. Experimental results show that k-BFS SumSweep is often the most accurate approximation algorithm (with an average relative accuracy between 90% to 100%) while using the fewest messages in large-scale systems, requiring only a modest amount of memory per node, and converging in a reasonable length of time.",

        "abstract": "Shape morphing, meaning a structure can first morph and then lock into another shape, can be applied to robot designs to endow robots with adaptive morphology for increased functionality and adaptivity. In this paper, we introduce a novel shape morphing scheme enabled by a new artificial muscle: twisted and coiled actuators (TCAs). This new actuator is purely soft, low cost, and electrically driven. Embedding a TCA and a thermoplastic material with variable stiffness into soft materials, we create a miniature shape-morphing link. We also establish a general model to predict the steady-state shape of the link given an input power applied to the TCA. Experiments are conducted to characterize parameters and verify the proposed model. Finally, we demonstrate this shape-morphing link can serve as a link in a mechanism to change the trajectory of its foot or endpoint. We envision that such a new shape-morphing scheme can enable robots to leverage the same mechanical design for different functions.",

        "abstract": "Research focusing on the development of socially assistive robots (SARs) for the care of older adults has grown in recent years, prompting a great deal of ethical analysis and reflection on the future of SARs in caring roles. Much of this ethical thinking, however, has taken place far from the settings where technological innovation is practiced. Different frameworks have been proposed to bridge this gap and enable researchers to handle the ethical dimension of technology from within the design and development process, including Value Sensitive Design (VSD). VSD has been defined as a \u201ctheoretically grounded approach to the design of technology that accounts for human values in a principled and comprehensive manner throughout the design process\u201d. Inspired in part by VSD, we have developed a process geared towards embedding ethics at the core of CARESSES, an international multidisciplinary project that aims to design the first culturally competent SAR for the care of older adults. Here we describe that process, which included extracting key ethical concepts from relevant ethical guidelines and applying those concepts to scenarios that describe how the CARESSES robot will interact with individuals belonging to different cultures. This approach highlights the ethical implications of the robot's behavior early in the design process, thus enabling researchers to identify and engage with ethical problems proactively.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Dense mapping is always the desire of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), especially for the applications that require fast and dense scene information. Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is a light-weight and effective solution to fast self-localization. However, VIO-based SLAM systems have difficulty in providing dense mapping results due to the spatial sparsity and temporal instability of the VIO depth estimations. Although there have been great efforts on real-time mapping and depth recovery from sparse measurements, the existing solutions for VIO-based SLAM still fail to preserve sufficient geometry details in their results. In this paper, we propose to embed depth recovery into VIO-based SLAM for real-time dense mapping. In the proposed method, we present a subspace-based stabilization scheme to maintain the temporal consistency and design a hierarchical pipeline for edge-preserving depth interpolation to reduce the computational burden. Numerous experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve an accuracy improvement of up to 49.1 cm compared to state-of-the-art learning-based methods for depth recovery and reconstruct sufficient geometric details in dense mapping when only 0.07% depth samples are available. Since a simple CPU implementation of our method already runs at 10-20 fps, we believe our method is very favorable for practical SLAM systems with critical computational requirements.",

In this paper, we propose an incremental learning model for selecting the user's representative or habitual emotional behaviors which place emphasis on individual users' cultural traits identified through long term interaction. Furthermore, a transformation model is proposed to convert the obtained emotional behaviors into a specific robot's motion space. To validate the proposed approach, the models were evaluated by two example scenarios of interaction. The experimental results confirmed that the proposed approach endows a social robot with the capability to learn emotional behaviors from individual users, and to generate its emotional bodily expressions. It was also verified that the imitated robot motions are rated emotionally acceptable by the demonstrator and recognizable by the subjects from the same cultural background with the demonstrator.",

        "abstract": "Embedding the dynamics of the Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) and applying a compositional controller around it can simplify dynamic legged robot locomotion control, but what is the energetic cost of this convenience? This paper measures the magnitude of this effect in such a way that the results are applicable to a wide class of jumping robots. A three-link monoped model with revolute joints is used to compare the energetic costs of locomotion using two different control approaches: 1) SLIP-embedding with a Raibert-style controller optimized for energetic efficiency, and 2) a trajectory optimized only for energetic efficiency. By performing this comparison in simulation for a large number of different monopeds randomly sampled from a space of realistic robot designs, it is found that the SLIP-Raibert approach requires, on average, almost twice the energy of the trajectory-optimized controller to traverse a given distance. Furthermore, the increase in energetic cost does not depend much on the particulars of the robot design, as the SLIP-Raibert approach requires at least 50% more energy for approximately 88% of realistic robot designs.",

We present a new energy preserving design based on a spring-augmented pendulum. We indirectly control the friction-induced stick-slip motions by exploiting the passive dynamics in order to achieve an improvement in overall travelling distance and energy efficiency. Both collocated and non-collocated constraint conditions are elaborately analysed and considered to obtain a desired trajectory generation profile. For tracking control, we develop a partial feedback controller for the driving pendulum which counteracts the dynamic contributions from the platform. Comparative simulation studies show the effectiveness and intriguing performance of the proposed approach, while its feasibility is experimentally verified through a physical robot. Our robot is to the best of our knowledge the first nonlinear-motion prototype in literature towards the VDR systems.",

For a given tilt profile, the minimum-energy trajectory between two prescribed boundary states is explicitly determined by solving an optimal control problem with respect to the angular accelerations of the six brushless motors. We also perform, for the first time, a systematic study of the singularities of the control allocation matrix of the hexarotor, showing the presence of subtle singular configurations that should be carefully avoided in the design phase. Numerical experiments conducted with the FAST-Hex platform illustrate the theory and delineate the pros and cons of dual-tilting paradigm in terms of maneuverability and energy efficiency.",

Contrary to most existing works, the strategy is stateless and operates using only a motor torque reference as input, making it suitable for robotics applications in which reference torque and speed are continuously and rapidly changing. Based on the system dynamics and constraints, we obtain four different operating modes. The strategy is extensively validated using three different experiments, which show an increase in peak velocity of up to 33%. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy is effective in extending the dynamic performance and explosive motion capabilities of robots.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Many robots make use of gravitational potential energy, generated by another mode, to enhance mobility through gliding locomotion. However, unstructured environments can create situations in which the initial conditions for steady-state gliding cannot be achieved; for example, jumping out of a hole, where the obstacle is very close to the robot. This paper suggests an optimization methodology for finding airfoil configurations and control strategies to maximize the effective non-steady-state gliding ratio for the most challenging initial condition, that of zero velocity. Parameters for the optimization are a location of a robot's center-of-mass in relation to its center-of-pressure and, through the addition of a tail, an active pitch control strategy. The optimal center-of-mass location produces the best passive gliding performance (morphological intelligence), and the optimal control strategy improves the gliding distance. Due to the aerodynamic complexities of modeling the collapsible airfoils, we find the optimal location of the center-of-mass from gliding experiments performed on the robot at different center-of-mass locations and initial pitch angles. An optimal location of the center-of-mass was found to be 40% of the wing chord for our robotic platform; measured from the wing's leading edge. The optimal location has a wide range of initial pitch angles which result in stable, yet non-steady-state, gliding behaviors. The morphological intelligence built into our robotic platform creates two observable dynamic behaviors, that of horizontal velocity gain and sink rate minimization. We then estimate the drag coefficients from the experiments, and conduct dynamic simulations to optimize the pitch control strategy. The design methodology presented here can enhance the non-steady-state gliding performance of a broad range of gliding robots, and the control strategy can further enhance performance on those which utilize an active tail.

This is considered a challenging task since in a teleoperation system the command-following bandwidth of the slave robot motion controller cannot be increased with a conventional motion controller as the desired trajectory is instantaneously commanded by the human user and thus, cannot be considered to be given in a pre-computed, smooth second order derivative form. We propose a method to increase the command-following bandwidth by extending the previously introduced Successive Stiffness Increment (SSI) approach to bilateral teleoperation. The approach allows realizing a very high motion controller gain, which cannot be realized with a conventional bilateral teleoperation controller as confirmed by experimental results.",

Our key observation is that for most tasks, the essence of the policy is captured in a few critical states: states in which it is very important to take a certain action. Our user studies show that if the robot shows a human what its understanding of the task's critical states is, then the human can make a more informed decision about whether to deploy the policy, and if she does deploy it, when she needs to take control from it at execution time.",

        "abstract": "Mobile robots are increasingly being used to assist with active pursuit and law enforcement. One major limitation for such missions is the resource (battery) allocated to the robot. Factors like nature and agility of evader, terrain over which pursuit is being carried out, plausible traversal velocity and the amount of necessary data to be collected all influence how long the robot can last in the field and how far it can travel. In this paper, we develop an analytical model that analyzes the energy utilization for a variety of components mounted on a robot to estimate the maximum operational range achievable by the robot operating on a single battery discharge. We categorize the major consumers of energy as: 1.) ancillary robotic functions such as computation, communication, sensing etc., and 2.) maneuvering which involves propulsion, steering etc. Both these consumers draw power from the common power source but the achievable range is largely affected by the proportion of power available for maneuvering. For this case study, we performed experiments with real robots on planar and graded surfaces and evaluated the estimation error for each case.",

The primary contributions of this paper are (i) to reduce the user instruction to a single click and (ii) to develop an efficient method to estimate an appropriate shape and manipulation model for a target door by integrating visual and touch information obtained by a robot. The proposed method first detects door candidates using a 3-D camera and then estimates the manipulation model of each candidate based on prior learning results. During door manipulation, the system integrates visual and touch information to estimate the shape and manipulation model to generate an appropriate motion. We evaluated the proposed method experimentally, and the results prove that the proposed method is effective.",

        "abstract": "A monocular 3D object tracking system generally has only up-to-scale pose estimation results without any prior knowledge of the tracked object. In this paper, we propose a novel idea to recover the metric scale of an arbitrary dynamic object by optimizing the trajectory of the objects in the world frame, without motion assumptions. By introducing an additional constraint in the time domain, our monocular visual-inertial tracking system can obtain continuous six degree of freedom (6-DoF) pose estimation without scale ambiguity. Our method requires neither fixed multi-camera nor depth sensor settings for scale observability, instead, the IMU inside the monocular sensing suite provides scale information for both camera itself and the tracked object. We build the proposed system on top of our monocular visual-inertial system (VINS) to obtain accurate state estimation of the monocular camera in the world frame. The whole system consists of a 2D object tracker, an object region-based visual bundle adjustment (BA), VINS and a correlation analysis-based metric scale estimator. Experimental comparisons with ground truth demonstrate the tracking accuracy of our 3D tracking performance while a mobile augmented reality (AR) demo shows the feasibility of potential applications.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The usage of articulated tools for autonomous robots is still a challenging task. One of the difficulties is to automatically estimate the tool's kinematics model. This model cannot be obtained from a single passive observation, because some information, such as a rotation axis (hinge), can only be detected when the tool is being used. Inspired by a baby using its hands while playing with an articulated toy, we employ a dual arm robotic setup and propose an interactive manipulation strategy based on visual-tactile servoing to estimate the tool's kinematics model. In our proposed method, one hand is holding the tool's handle stably, and the other arm equipped with tactile finger flips the movable part of the articulated tool. An innovative visuo-tactile servoing controller is introduced to implement the flipping task by integrating the vision and tactile feedback in a compact control loop. In order to deal with the temporary invisibility of the movable part in camera, a data fusion method which integrates the visual measurement of the movable part and the fingertip's motion trajectory is used to optimally estimate the orientation of the tool's movable part. The important tool's kinematic parameters are estimated by geometric calculations while the movable part is flipped by the finger. We evaluate our method by flipping a pivoting cleaning head (flap) of a wiper and estimating the wiper's kinematic parameters. We demonstrate that the flap of the wiper is flipped robustly, even the flap is shortly invisible. The orientation of the flap is tracked well compared to the ground truth data. The kinematic parameters of the wiper are estimated correctly.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Providing force feedback as a feature in current Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery systems still remains a challenge. In recent years, Vision-Based Force Sensing (VBFS) has emerged as a promising approach to address this problem. Existing methods have been developed in a Supervised Learning (SL) setting. Nonetheless, most of the video sequences related to robotic surgery are not provided with ground-truth force data, which can be easily acquired in a controlled environment. A powerful approach to process unlabeled video sequences and find a compact representation for each video frame relies on using an Unsupervised Learning (UL) method. Afterward, a model trained in an SL setting can take advantage of the available ground-truth force data. In the present work, UL and SL techniques are used to investigate a model in a Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) framework, consisting of an encoder network and a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. First, a Convolutional Auto-Encoder (CAE) is trained to learn a compact representation for each RGB frame in a video sequence. To facilitate the reconstruction of high and low frequencies found in images, this CAE is optimized using an adversarial framework and a L1-loss, respectively. Thereafter, the encoder network of the CAE is serially connected with an LSTM network and trained jointly to minimize the difference between ground-truth and estimated force data. Datasets addressing the force estimation task are scarce. Therefore, the experiments have been validated in a custom dataset. The results suggest that the proposed approach is promising.",

As a part of CoSTAR's wide range of capabilities, it allows users to specify SmartMoves: abstract goals such as \u201cpick up component A from the right side of the table.\u201d Users were asked to perform pick-and-place assembly tasks with either SmartMoves or one of three simpler baseline versions of CoSTAR. Overall, participants found CoSTAR to be highly usable, with an average System Usability Scale score of 73.4 out of 100. SmartMove also helped users perform tasks faster and more effectively; all SmartMove users completed the first two tasks, while not all users completed the tasks using the other strategies. SmartMove users showed better performance for incorporating perception across all three tasks.",

To improve the quality of life of the elderly persons, physical assistance such as transfer, movement, and bathroom assistance is important. It is also important to reduce the workload of caregivers in an aging society. In recent years, assistive robotic devices for nursing care have been developed and commercialized for such purposes. However, such devices have not become popular in the care facilities yet. One of the reasons is that it is still difficult to evaluate the effects of the devices on the care receivers and caregivers. In particular, it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate the effect of the devices on the human body from the viewpoint of safety and comfort. We have developed a whole-body robotic system to simulate the pose and motion of the elderly persons. The purpose of this system is to realize quantitative physical evaluation of robotics devices for nursing care of the human body. The experimental results of the preliminary evaluation of assistive robotic devices are also presented.",

        "abstract": "Event-based vision sensors, such as the Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS), are ideally suited for real-time motion analysis. The unique properties encompassed in the readings of such sensors provide high temporal resolution, superior sensitivity to light and low latency. These properties provide the grounds to estimate motion efficiently and reliably in the most sophisticated scenarios, but these advantages come at a price - modern event-based vision sensors have extremely low resolution, produce a lot of noise and require the development of novel algorithms to handle the asynchronous event stream. This paper presents a new, efficient approach to object tracking with asynchronous cameras. We present a novel event stream representation which enables us to utilize information about the dynamic (temporal)component of the event stream. The 3D geometry of the event stream is approximated with a parametric model to motion-compensate for the camera (without feature tracking or explicit optical flow computation), and then moving objects that don't conform to the model are detected in an iterative process. We demonstrate our framework on the task of independent motion detection and tracking, where we use the temporal model inconsistencies to locate differently moving objects in challenging situations of very fast motion.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Given that the success of an interaction task depends on the capability of the robot system to handle physical contact with its environment, pure motion control is often insufficient. This is especially true in the context of medical freehand ultrasound where the human body is a deformable surface and an unstructured environment, representing both a safety concern and a challenge for trajectory planning and control. The systematic tuning of practical high degree-of-freedom physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) tasks is not trivial and there are many parameters to be tuned. While traditional tuning is generally performed ad hoc and requires knowledge of the robot and environment dynamics, we propose a simple and effective online tuning framework using differential evolution (DE) to optimize the motion parameters for parallel force/impedance control in a pHRI and medical ultrasound motion application. Through real-world experiments with a KUKA LBR iiwa 7 R800 collaborative robot, the DE framework tuned motion control for optimal and safe trajectories along a human leg phantom. The optimization process was able to successfully reduce the mean absolute error of the motion contact force to 0.537 N through the evolution of eight motion control parameters.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel biologically inspired evolving neural oscillator for quadruped robot locomotion to minimize constraints during the locomotion process. The proposed sensory-motor coordination model is formed by the interconnection between motor and sensory neurons. The model utilizes Bacterial Programming to reconstruct the number of joints and neurons in each joint based on environmental conditions. Bacterial Programming is inspired by the evolutionary process of bacteria that includes bacterial mutation and gene transfer process. In this system, either the number of joints, the number of neurons, or the interconnection structure are changing dynamically depending on the sensory information from sensors equipped on the robot. The proposed model is simulated in computer for realizing the optimization process and the optimized structure is then applied to a real quadruped robot for locomotion process. The optimizing process is based on tree structure optimization to simplify the sensory-motor interconnection structure. The proposed model was validated by series of real robot experiments in different environmental conditions.",

We encouraged the students to ask questions anytime. Half of the classroom was told to ask questions by raising their hand while the other half was shown an online messaging system developed for CommU, which allows the audience to post questions, which the robot would directly say. We had a gatekeeper to monitor for invalid sentences. In the middle of the presentation we asked the students to shift roles. The robot used a neural network based estimator of interruptibility to find the best time to speak. We did not expect too many questions, but the audience really embraced using the robot. They posted 44 questions to the presenter through CommU. On the other hand they asked 8 direct questions by raising their hands and standing up. Students thought that they gained more information from the lecturer using the robot than using the conventional method. In this instance we didn't stop the students from asking too many questions, but in a real-world application the gatekeeper will have to play an important role.",

        "abstract": "Learning approaches have enabled significant performance improvements in robotic control allowing robots to execute motions that were previously impossible. The majority of the work to date, however, assumes that the parts to be learned are static or slowly changing, which limits their applicability in realistic scenarios with rapid changes in the conditions. This paper presents a method to extend an existing single-mode safe learning controller based on Gaussian Process Regression to learn an increasing number of non-linear models for the robot dynamics. We show that this approach enables a robot to re-use past experiences from a large number of previously visited operating conditions, and to safely adapt when a new and distinct operating condition is encountered. This allows the robot to achieve safety and high performance in a large number of operating conditions that do not have to be specified ahead of time. Our approach runs independently from the controller, imposing no additional computation time on the control loop regardless of the number of previous operating conditions considered. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in experiment on a 900 kg ground robot with both physical and artificial changes to its dynamics. All of our experiments are conducted using vision for localization.",

One of the characteristics of this algorithm is the fact that, unlike the original RRT for kinodynamic systems, it generates deterministic control sequences which can be reproduced as long as the sequence of references (sampled states) are known. Here, the performance of the proposed algorithm is tested against the basic RRT, showing that the EGK-RRT greatly improves in terms of execution speed. In addition to this, the influence of using a visibility check and an inertia estimation in order to select the nearest neighbor is also analyzed, demonstrating that a combination of both factors leads to a better overall performance, both in execution speed and in quality of the generated path.",

        "abstract": "Camera relocalization plays a vital role in many robotics and computer vision applications, such as self-driving cars and virtual reality. Recent random forests based methods exploit randomly sampled pixel comparison features to predict 3D world locations for 2D image locations to guide the camera pose optimization. However, these point features are only sampled randomly in images, without considering geometric information such as lines, leading to large errors with the existence of poorly textured areas or in motion blur. Line segments are more robust in these environments. In this work, we propose to jointly exploit points and lines within the framework of uncertainty driven regression forests. The proposed approach is thoroughly evaluated on three publicly available datasets against several strong state-of-the-art baselines in terms of several different error metrics. Experimental results prove the efficacy of our method, showing superior or on-par state-of-the-art performance.",

The sensor is comprised of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a pressure sensor to accurately estimate the surface orientation in a wide range, while at the same time measuring contact force. We describe the developed sensor prototype and evaluate its performance regarding contact detection capability and normal estimation accuracy. We use this to reconstruct the surface of unknown objects using the humanoid robot ARMAR-III resulting in a mean reconstruction accuracy of 3.6 mm.",

In this work, we use the Neuro-robotic Platform (NRP)to evaluate the vestibulo ocular cerebellar adaptatIon (Vestibulo-ocular reflex, VOR)mediated by two STDP mechanisms located at the cerebellar molecular layer and the vestibular nuclei respectively. This simulation study adopts an experimental setup (rotatory VOR)widely used by neuroscientists to better understand the contribution of certain specific cerebellar properties (i.e. distributed STDP, neural properties, coding cerebellar topology, etc.)to r-VOR adaptation. The work proposes and describes an embodiment solution for which we endow a simulated humanoid robot (iCub)with a spiking cerebellar model by means of the NRP, and we face the humanoid to an r-VOR task. The results validate the adaptive capabilities of the spiking cerebellar model (with STDP)in a perception-action closed-loop (r- VOR)causing the simulated iCub robot to mimic a human behavior.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper describes a novel sensorless force estimation algorithm for the rigid link parallel wrist mechanism of a robotic surgical instrument. The method utilizes novel reaction force observers (RFOB) in joint space, which are modified disturbance observers (DOB) combined with Neural Networks (NN) for inverse dynamics calculations, to estimate external forces acting on the motors. External force/torque estimation in Cartesian space is achieved by the use of the robot Jacobian. The proposed algorithm is applicable to any back-drivable rigid-link wrist mechanism without the need for force sensors. In this paper, the method is implemented on a novel 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) parallel robotic surgical wrist mechanism that is designed for high dexterity (\u00b190 degrees pitch-yaw rotations, thrust motion) and force/torque estimation. The wrist is actuated extracorporally with 3 rigid push-pull rods and 3 linear motors. With a rigid transmission and high back-drivability, external force/torque estimation can be achieved from the motor position readings utilizing the proposed method. Several experiments were performed on the manufactured prototype of the instrument and results validate the efficacy of the wrist and estimation method with RMS force/torque estimation error values of 0.0024 Nm in pitch axis, 0.0043 Nm in yaw axis and 0.1866 N in thrust axis.",

        "abstract": "Financial and social elements of modern societies are closely connected to the cultivation of corn. Due to its massive production, deficiencies during the cultivation process directly translate to major financial losses. Since proper surveillance in a large scale is still very challenging, the companies that specialize in optimizing crop yield are trying to address the problem at its root by developing hybrid plants able to resist the harsh conditions of the field. The selection of the best hybrid is not easy and every year hundreds of test plants with different phenotypic characteristics are planted while their performance is quantified by inconsistent and rough measurements gathered by humans. We propose a pipeline that takes advantage of the structure from motion technology to create a detailed 3D point cloud of a few plants and segment it into the basic elements of the scene; the ground, the plants, the plant stems, and the plant leaves. The focus is on the segmentation process through which several phenotypic characteristics of individual plants can be extracted. As an example, we show the results for the plant counting and plant height estimation processes where we achieve an accuracy of 88.1% and 89.2%.",

        "abstract": "For a deeper understanding of ecological functions and semantics of wild bird vocalizations (i.e., songs and calls), it is important to clarify the fine-scaled and detailed relationships among their characteristics of vocalizations and their behavioral contexts. However, it takes a lot of time and effort to obtain such data using conventional recordings or by human observation. Bringing out a robot to a field is our approach to solve this problem. We are developing a portable observation system called HARKBird using a robot audition HARK and microphone arrays to understand temporal patterns of vocalizations characteristics and their behavioral contexts. In this paper, we introduce a prototype system to 2D localize vocalizations of wild birds in real-time, and to classify their song types after recording. We show that the system can estimate the position of songs of a target individual and classify their songs with a reasonable quality to discuss their song - behavior relationships.",

        "abstract": "Tracking and controlling the shape of continuum dexterous manipulators (CDM) in constraint environments is a challenging task. The imposed constraints and interaction with unknown obstacles may conform the CDM's shape and therefore demands for shape sensing methods which do not rely on direct line of sight. To address these issues, we integrate a novel Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) shape sensing unit into a CDM, reconstruct the shape in real-time, and develop an optimization-based control algorithm using FBG tip position feedback. The CDM is designed for less-invasive treatment of osteolysis (bone degradation). To evaluate the performance of the feedback control algorithm when the CDM interacts with obstacles, we perform a set of experiments similar to the real scenario of the CDM interaction with soft and hard lesions during the treatment of osteolysis. In addition, we propose methods for identification of the CDM collisions with soft or hard obstacles using the jacobian information. Results demonstrate successful control of the CDM tip based on the FBG feedback and indicate repeatability and robustness of the proposed method when interacting with unknown obstacles.",

The goal is to generate proper forces on the fingertips of an anthropomorphic device during in-hand manipulation to produce desired displacements of selected control points on the object. The desired motions of the fingers are computed in real-time as an inverse solution of a Finite Element Method (FEM), the forces applied by the fingertips at the contact points being modelled by Lagrange multipliers. The elasticity parameters of the model are preliminarly estimated using a vision system and a force sensor. Experimental results are shown with an underactuated anthropomorphic hand that performs a manipulation task on a soft cylindrical object.",

In this paper, we propose an algorithm FOCS (Fusion of Optimal Control and Search) that combines these two classes of approaches together. FOCS finds a path exploiting the advantages of both approaches while providing a bound on the sub-optimality of its solution. The returned path is a concatenation of the path found in the implicit graph constructed by search and the path generated by following the negative gradient of the value function obtained as a solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We analyze the algorithm and illustrate its effectiveness in finding a minimum-time path for a car-like vehicle in different environments.",

        "abstract": "Robot control algorithms often rely on measurements of robot joint velocities, which can be estimated by measuring the time between encoder edges. When encoder edges occur infrequently, such as at low velocities and/or with low resolution encoders, this measurement delay may affect the stability of closed-loop control. This is evident in both the joint position control and Cartesian impedance control of the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK), which contains several low-resolution encoders. We present a hardware-based method that gives more frequent velocity updates and is not affected by common encoder imperfections such as non-uniform duty cycles and quadrature phase error. The proposed method measures the time between consecutive edges of the same type but, unlike prior methods, is implemented for the rising and falling edges of both channels. Additionally, it estimates acceleration to enable software compensation of the measurement delay. The method is shown to improve Cartesian impedance control of the dVRK.",

Several efficient line segment detection algorithms such as LSD and EDLines have recently emerged. However, the state of the art segment grouping methods are not robust enough or not amenable for detecting lines in real-time. In this paper we present FSG, a fast and robust line detection algorithm. It is based on two independent components. A proposer that greedily cluster segments suggesting plausible line candidates and a probabilistic model that decides if a group of segments is an actual line. In the experiments we show that our procedure is more robust and faster than the best methods in the literature and achieves state-of-the art performance in a high level robot localization task such as vanishing points detection.",

Here, we investigate two different types of nanoscale swimmers as depicted in Figure 1. One consists of a rigid magnetic head linked to a semi-soft tail (1-link swimmer). Another consists of a rigid magnetic head and tail connected by a soft hinge (2-link swimmer). Both swimmers exhibit undulatory locomotion under an applied oscillating magnetic field. The speeds of the swimmers are assessed as a function of the oscillating magnetic field frequency and the sweeping angle. We find that a resonance-like frequency increases as the length decreases, and, in general, the speed increases as the sweeping angle increases. Last, we show that 2-link swimmers can also swim in a corkscrew-like pattern under rotating magnetic fields.",

Unsafe situations might arise during manipulation in unstructured environments due to noises in sensory feedback, improper action parameters, hardware limitations or external factors. In order to assure safety, continuous execution monitoring and failure detection procedures are mandatory. To this end, we present a multimodal failure monitoring and detection system to detect manipulation failures. Rather than relying only on a single sensor modality, we consider integration of different modalities to get better detection performance in different failure cases. In our system, high level proprioceptive, auditory and visual predicates are extracted by processing each modality separately. Then, the extracted predicates are fused. Experiments on a humanoid robot for tabletop manipulation scenarios indicate that the contribution of each modality is different depending on the action in execution and multimodal fusion results in an overall performance increase in detecting failures compared to the performance attained by unimodal processing.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces the problem of long-range monocular depth estimation for outdoor urban environments. Range sensors and traditional depth estimation algorithms (both stereo and single view) predict depth for distances of less than 100 meters in outdoor settings and 10 meters in indoor settings. The shortcomings of outdoor single view methods that use learning approaches are, to some extent, due to the lack of long-range ground truth training data, which in turn is due to limitations of range sensors. To circumvent this, we first propose a novel strategy for generating synthetic long-range ground truth depth data. We utilize Google Earth images to reconstruct large-scale 3D models of different cities with proper scale. The acquired repository of 3D models and associated RGB views along with their long-range depth renderings are used as training data for depth prediction. We then train two deep neural network models for long-range depth estimation: i) a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and ii) a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We found in our experiments that the GAN model predicts depth more accurately. We plan to open-source the database and the baseline models for public use.",

We empirically obtain an approximate measure for the rate of success of a robotic pickup operation based on the accuracy of the object detection network. Our experiments show that adding an optimally weighted Euclidean distance loss to a network trained on the commonly used Intersection over Union (IoU) metric reduces the convergence time by 42.48%. The estimated pickup rate is improved by 39.90%. Compared to state-of-the-art task weighting methods, the improvement is 24.5% in convergence, and 15.8% on the estimated pickup rate.",

While, compared to state-of-the-art plane extraction, the latency of CAPE is more consistent and 4\u201310 times faster, depending on the scene, we also demonstrate empirically that applying CAPE to visual odometry can improve trajectory estimation on scenes made of cylindrical surfaces (e.g. tunnels), whereas using a plane extraction approach that is not curve-aware deteriorates performance on these scenes. To use these geometric primitives in visual odometry, we propose extending a probabilistic RGB-D odometry framework based on points, lines and planes to cylinder primitives. Following this framework, CAPE runs on fused depth maps and the parameters of cylinders are modelled probabilistically to account for uncertainty and weight accordingly the pose optimization residuals.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a sampling-based kino-dynamic planning framework for a bipedal robot in complex environments. Unlike other footstep planning algorithms which typically plan footstep locations and the biped dynamics in separate steps, we handle both simultaneously. Three primary advantages of this approach are (1) the ability to differentiate alternate routes while selecting footstep locations based on the temporal duration of the route as determined by the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) dynamics, (2) the ability to perform collision checking through time so that collisions with moving obstacles are prevented without avoiding their entire trajectory, and (3) the ability to specify a minimum forward velocity for the biped. To generate a dynamically consistent description of the walking behavior, we exploit the Phase Space Planner (PSP) [1] [2]. To plan a collision-free route toward the goal, we adapt planning strategies from non-holonomic wheeled robots to gather a sequence of inputs for the PSP. This allows us to efficiently approximate dynamic and kinematic constraints on bipedal motion, to apply a sampling-based planning algorithm such as RRT or RRT*, and to use the Dubin's path [3] as the steering method to connect two points in the configuration space. The results of the algorithm are sent to a Whole Body Controller [1] to generate full body dynamic walking behavior. Our planning algorithm is tested in a 3D physics-based simulation of the humanoid robot Valkyrie.",

In our solution, we first obtain a shadow prior map with the help of multi-class support vector machine using statistical features. Then, we use a semantic-aware patch-level Convolutional Neural Network that efficiently trains on shadow examples by combining the original image and the shadow prior map. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the proposed method significantly decreases the time complexity of shadow detection, by one or two orders of magnitude compared with state-of-the-art methods, without losing accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Motion trajectory planning is one crucial aspect for automated vehicles, as it governs the own future behavior in a dynamically changing environment. A good utilization of a vehicle's characteristics requires the consideration of the nonlinear system dynamics within the optimization problem to be solved. In particular, real-time feasibility is essential for automated driving, in order to account for the fast changing surrounding, e.g. for moving objects. The key contributions of this paper are the presentation of a fast optimization algorithm for trajectory planning including the nonlinear system model. Further, a new concurrent operation scheme for two optimization algorithms is derived and investigated. The proposed algorithm operates in the submillisecond range on a standard PC. As an exemplary scenario, the task of driving along a challenging reference course is demonstrated.",

Lack of actuation at ankles is a disadvantage in the fast walking of PAWs. We started this study with an intuitive hypothesis that rhythmic sway of torso may enable faster walking in PAWs. To test this hypothesis, firstly, we optimized the rhythmic sway of torso of a simulated PAW model for fast walking speed, and analyzed the robustness of the optimal trajectories. Then we implemented the optimal trajectories on a real robot. Both the simulation analysis and the experimental results indicated that optimized torso-swaying can greatly increase the walking speed by 40%. By analyzing the walking patterns of the simulated model and the real robot, we identified the reason for the faster walking with swaying-torso: The rhythmic sway of torso enables the robot to walk with a relatively large step-length while still keeninu a hizh sten-frenuencv.",

Differently from all other approaches, our method has a capability of running at over 30Hz while performing all processing components, including SLAM, segmentation, 2D recognition, and updating class probabilities of each segmentation label at every incoming frame, thanks to the high efficiency that characterizes the computationally intensive stages of our framework. By utilizing a specifically designed CNN to improve the frame-wise segmentation result, we can also achieve high accuracy. We validate our method on the NYUv2 dataset by comparing with the state of the art in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, and by means of an analysis in terms of time and space complexity.",

Their non-holonomic motion, while being a challenge for motion planning, is utilized here to place discs which are used as an approximation of the robot's shape in a predictive manner. For ease of comparison, we assume the robot to be rectangular, i. e., we use bounding boxes. Our algorithm is compared to a widely-used baseline and shows similar performance in terms of under- and oversampling while being approximately 20-40 % faster. Another feature of the algorithm is its predictive nature: with the frontal disc, we already check for collisions that would occur with the rear disc in the next sample, assuming near-constant curvature. While this might be conservative in some cases where large steering rates are necessary, in our evaluation even tight corridors could be navigated without negative effects.",

Robotic rehabilitation devices have the potential to reduce the physical strain put on therapists due to the high-effort one-to-one interactions between the therapist and patient involving repetitive high-intensity movements to restore arm and hand functions. Numerous custom robotic devices have been developed in recent years to aid in physical rehabilitation of stroke patients, but most commercially available systems are high-cost devices because of low production volumes and high development costs. In this paper, we analyse the safety and functionality of the UR5 collaborative industrial robot from universal Robots equipped with an external force/torque sensor in a real-time control system for typical rehabilitation exercises. The aim of the paper is to show that a new class of general-purpose industrial robots designed for human-robot collaboration may prove a viable alternative to custom designs. Experiments show that robotic rehabilitation of the upper limbs using a standard industrial robot manipulator UR5 may be feasible. Results have the potential to make robotic rehabilitation more available as a high-quality therapeutic treatment for more patients.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Bipedal locomotion skills are challenging to develop. Control strategies often use local linearization of the dynamics in conjunction with reduced-order abstractions to yield tractable solutions. In these model-based control strategies, the controller is often not fully aware of many details, including torque limits, joint limits, and other non-linearities that are necessarily excluded from the control computations for simplicity. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers a promising model-free approach for controlling bipedal locomotion which can more fully exploit the dynamics. However, current results in the machine learning literature are often based on ad-hoc simulation models that are not based on corresponding hardware. Thus it remains unclear how well DRL will succeed on realizable bipedal robots. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DRL using a realistic model of Cassie, a bipedal robot. By formulating a feedback control problem as finding the optimal policy for a Markov Decision Process, we are able to learn robust walking controllers that imitate a reference motion with DRL. Controllers for different walking speeds are learned by imitating simple time-scaled versions of the original reference motion. Controller robustness is demonstrated through several challenging tests, including sensory delay, walking blindly on irregular terrain and unexpected pushes at the pelvis. We also show we can interpolate between individual policies and that robustness can be improved with an interpolated policy.",

In this paper, we present an input state feedback linearization controller for the tip positioning of a flexible link arm with a gravity compensation system based on springs. The controller is implemented into a double loop control scheme, in which the inner loop addresses the motor position control in presence of joint friction, and the outer loop deals with vibration cancellation and the tracking of fourth-order trajectories for the tip position of the flexible arm. Taking into considerations the interacting forces between the flexible link and the gravity compensation mechanism, and also the characteristics of the control law, we propose a sensory system to measure all the relevant signals. The proposed controller is tested on an experimental prototype built in our laboratory.",

        "abstract": "Robust grasping is a major, and still unsolved, problem in robotics. Information about the 3D shape of an object can be obtained either from prior knowledge (e.g., accurate models of known objects or approximate models of familiar objects) or real-time sensing (e.g., partial point clouds of unknown objects) and can be used to identify good potential grasps. However, due to modeling and sensing inaccuracies, local exploration is often needed to refine such grasps and successfully apply them in the real world. The recently proposed unscented Bayesian optimization technique can make such exploration safer by selecting grasps that are robust to uncertainty in the input space (e.g., inaccuracies in the grasp execution). Extending our previous work on 2D optimization, in this paper we propose a 3D haptic exploration strategy that combines unscented Bayesian optimization with a novel collision penalty heuristic to find safe grasps in a very efficient way: while by augmenting the search-space to 3D we are able to find better grasps, the collision penalty heuristic allows us to do so without increasing the number of exploration steps.",

        "abstract": "Prescribed fires can lessen wildfire severity and control invasive species, but they can also be risky and costly. Unmanned aerial systems can reduce those drawbacks by, for example, dropping ignition spheres to ignite the most hazardous areas. Existing systems, however, lack awareness of the fire vectors to operate autonomously, safely, and efficiently. In this work we address that limitation, introducing an approach that integrates a lightweight fire simulator and a planner for trajectories and ignition sphere drop waypoints. Both components are unique in that they are amenable to input from the system's sensors and the fire crew to increase fire awareness. We conducted a preliminary study that confirms that such inputs improve the accuracy of the fire simulation to counter the unpredictability of the target environment. The field study of the system showed that the fire-aware planner generated safe trajectories with effective ignitions leveraging the fire simulator predictions.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the motion planning of a novel aerial robotic system with a long-bar extension and two arms for long-reach manipulation in cluttered environments. The novel aerial long-reach manipulator includes a passive revolute joint between the aerial platform and the dual arm. This feature minimises the torque induced to the aerial system in case of unexpected collisions of the manipulator. The motion planning problem is addressed considering jointly the complete set of configuration variables for the aerial platform and the dual arm. Furthermore, the planner has been built over the fundamentals of RRT* algorithms in order to optimise the performance of the trajectories in terms of energy and time. The proposed planning method has been experimentally validated in a realistic industrial scenario, the transportation of a long bar through a cluttered environment consisting of several pipe structures.",

On the other hand, it is difficult for most robot hands to manage both. Therefore in this paper we developed the hand which can grasp various objects and exert large gripping force. To develop such hand, we focused on the thumb CM joint with wide range of motion and the MP joints of four fingers with the DOF of abduction and adduction. Based on the hand with large gripping force and flexibility using machined spring, we applied above mentioned joint mechanism to the hand. The thumb CM joint has wide range of motion because of the combination of three machined springs and MP joints of four fingers have variable rigidity mechanism instead of driving each joint independently in order to move joint in limited space and by limited actuators. Using the developed hand, we achieved the grasping of various objects, supporting a large load and several motions with an arm.",

The key points include the motion to be quick and the fan to be opened to the maximum degree possible without human intervention. A robotic arm with 7 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) is used to manipulate the autonomous motion. The fan placed on the table is localized and detected using a camera by background subtraction, masking and filtering; post which the contour of the fan is detected. The pixels obtained is then transformed into real life coordinates. The Dynamixel motors then traverses to the coordinates of the fan's position to grasp, open, flap, close and put the fan down.",

This paper proposes a Flatness-based Model Predictive Control (FMPC) approach that can be applied to quadrotors, and more generally, differentially flat nonlinear systems. Our proposed FMPC couples feedback model predictive control with feedforward linearization. The proposed approach has the computational advantage that, similar to linear model predictive control, it only requires solving a convex quadratic program instead of a nonlinear program. However, unlike linear model predictive control, we still account for the nonlinearity in the model through the use of an inverse term. In simulation, we demonstrate improved robustness over approaches that couple model predictive control with feedback linearization. In experiments using quadrotor vehicles, we also demonstrate improved trajectory tracking compared to classical linear and nonlinear model predictive control approaches.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce the achievement of the flight motion to pass through small opening by the multilinked and transformable aerial robot. Previous works about such motion are based on under-actuated multirotors, indicating that aggressive maneuvering is necessary condition. This involves two crucial problems: i) enough free space for deceleration is necessary, otherwise the robot would collide with unknown obstacle after exiting opening; ii) the multirotor can not traverse the openings that are smaller than the robot body. The proposed transformable aerial robot in our work can solve these problems, since the multilinked model can not only guarantee the near-hover condition during the whole motion sequence, but also slowly traverse relative small openings by changing its form like a snake. We first propose an improved dynamics derivation and flight control method for this multilinked aerial robot based on our previous work. Then, we present the path planning method which takes the flight stability in the near-hover condition into account. Finally we demonstrate the experimental results of the motion to pass through a horizontal and small opening which also involves the borders (the floor and the ceiling).",

        "abstract": "The enhanced dexterity and manipulability offered by continuum manipulators makes them the robots of choice for complex procedures inside the human body. However, without tailored analytical tools to evaluate their manipulability, many capabilities of continuum robots such as safe and effective manipulation will remain largely inaccessible. This paper presents a quantifiable measure for analysing force/velocity manipulability of continuum robots. We expand classical measures of manipulability for rigid robots to introduce three types of manipulability indices to continuum robots, namely, velocity, compliance, and unified force-velocity manipulability. We provide a specific case study using the proposed method to analyse the force/velocity manipulability for a concentric-tube robot. We investigate the application of the manipulability measures to compare performance of continuum robots in terms of compliance and force-velocity manipulability. The proposed manipulability measures enable future research on design and optimal path planning for continuum robots.",

        "abstract": "In multi-robot systems, although the idea of behaviors allows for an efficient solution to low-level tasks, high-level missions can rarely be achieved by the execution of a single behavior. In contrast to this, a sequence of behaviors would provide the requisite expressiveness, but there are no a priori guarantees that the sequence is composable in the sense that the robots can actually execute it. In order to guarantee a provably correct composition of behaviors, Finite-Time Convergence Control Barrier Functions are introduced in this paper to guarantee the terminal configuration of one behavior is a valid initial configuration for the following one. Nominal control inputs prescribed by the behaviors are modified in a minimally invasive fashion, in order to establish the information-exchange network required by the following behavior. The effectiveness of the proposed composition strategy is validated on a team of mobile robots.",

        "abstract": "This research seeks greater efficiency for walking robots. Efficiency can be improved in two ways: better performance (i.e., less wasted motion) and reduced energy consumption. Fractional-order control is a pathway to both of these improvements because of the flexibility it offers in designing a control strategy. Compared to the existing proportional-derivative architecture, changing the order of the derivative - the number of derivatives taken - to real numbers other than 1 has yielded both types of improvement for a simulated walker. The evidence of better performance is the leg angles' improvement in maintaining a desired relationship with respect to one another. Depending on the controller chosen, the walker can also be made to achieve the original level of performance with reduced control signals and less torque delivered to the hip joint, implying greater energy efficiency.",

We have developed an assistive robotic system with an intuitive free-view gaze interface. The user's point of regard is estimated in 3D space while allowing free head movement and is combined with object recognition and trajectory planning. This framework allows the user to interact with objects using fixations. Two operational modes have been implemented to cater for different eventualities. The automatic mode performs a pre-defined task associated with a gaze-selected object, while the manual mode allows gaze control of the robot's end-effector position on the user's frame of reference. User studies reported effortless operation in automatic mode. A manual pick and place task achieved a success rate of 100% on the users' first attempt.",

In the evaluation experiment, we generated interaction behavior using a convolution neural network, which learned from the behaviors of friendship and unknown relationship, who have high and low familiarity respectively. We evaluated how much such interaction behavior affect the human impression by questionnaire survey.",

The network consists of two parts: the feature extractor and multi-grasp predictor. The feature extractor is a deep convolutional neural network. The multi-grasp predictor regresses grasp rectangles from predefined oriented rectangles, called oriented anchor boxes, and classifies the rectangles into graspable and ungraspable. On the standard Cornell Grasp Dataset, our model achieves an accuracy of 97.74% and 96.61% on image-wise split and object-wise split respectively, and outperforms the latest state-of-the-art approach by 1.74% on image-wise split and 0.51% on object-wise split.",

A comparative analysis between fused angles and Euler angles is presented in this paper, delineating the specific differences between the two representations that make fused angles more suitable for representing orientations in balance-related scenarios. Aspects of comparison include the locations of the singularities, the associated parameter sensitivities, the level of mutual independence of the parameters, and the axisymmetry of the parameters.",

        "abstract": "Nascent endoscopic therapeutic procedures, such as endoscopic submucosal dissection, enable unparalleled access to and removal of mid-size cancerous neoplasia from within the gastrointestinal tract. However, the remote locations of these lesions often incur substantial distal dexterity which imparts appreciable cognitive loading on the clinician and opens up the possibility of adverse events such as intestinal perforation due to limited dexterity and a lack of sensory feedback. In this work, we introduce a mm-scale, tip-mounted robotic system, EndoMODRA (Endoscopic Module for On-Demand Robotic Assistance), which interfaces with commercially-available endoscopic tools and provides additional dexterity and feedback sensing using on-board actuators and sensors, decoupling tool motion from endoscope motion. Leveraging alternative high-energy-density actuation strategies and monolithic, printed-circuit-inspired manufacturing processes, all actuation and sensing is fully contained within the distally-mounted module, obviating the need for a continuous mechanical transmission to a proximal motor package. We develop a fuzzy-tuned PID/PWM controller for closing the loop distally to enable closed-loop position-controlled trajectory execution using onboard actuation and sensing, realizing fully -distal loop closure in an endoscope-mounted robotic module with no proximal actuation or sensing component. Controller performance is validated on a fully-integrated module with on-board sensing, demonstrating the ability to execute pre-determined trajectories as well as real-time rate-based teleoperation.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We present semi-supervised deep learning approaches for traversability estimation from fisheye images. Our method, GONet, and the proposed extensions leverage Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to effectively predict whether the area seen in the input image(s) is safe for a robot to traverse. These methods are trained with many positive images of traversable places, but just a small set of negative images depicting blocked and unsafe areas. This makes the proposed methods practical. Positive examples can be collected easily by simply operating a robot through traversable spaces, while obtaining negative examples is time consuming, costly, and potentially dangerous. Through extensive experiments and several demonstrations, we show that the proposed traversability estimation approaches are robust and can generalize to unseen scenarios. Further, we demonstrate that our methods are memory efficient and fast, allowing for real-time operation on a mobile robot with single or stereo fisheye cameras. As part of our contributions, we open-source two new datasets for traversability estimation. These datasets are composed of approximately 24h of videos from more than 25 indoor environments. Our methods outperform baseline approaches for traversability estimation on these new datasets.",

In this paper, we consider the problem of planning a strategy for covering articulated environments where the robot also has to manipulate objects to inspect obstructed areas. This problem is particularly challenging due to the many degrees of freedom resulting from the articulation. We propose to exploit graphics processing units present in many embedded devices to parallelize the computations of a greedy next-best-view approach. We implemented algorithms for costmap computation, path planning, as well as simulation and evaluation of viewpoint candidates in OpenGL for Embedded Systems and benchmarked the implementations on multiple device classes ranging from smartphones to multi-GPU servers. We introduce a heuristic for estimating a utility map from images rendered with strategically placed spherical cameras and show in simulation experiments that robots can successfully explore complex articulated scenes with our system.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Soft microrobots based on photoresponsive materials and controlled by light fields can generate a variety of different gaits. This inherent flexibility can be exploited to maximize their locomotion performance in a given environment and used to adapt them to changing conditions. Albeit, because of the lack of accurate locomotion models, and given the intrinsic variability among microrobots, analytical control design is not possible. Common data-driven approaches, on the other hand, require running prohibitive numbers of experiments and lead to very sample-specific results. Here we propose a probabilistic learning approach for light-controlled soft microrobots based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Gaussian Processes (GPs). The proposed approach results in a learning scheme that is data-efficient, enabling gait optimization with a limited experimental budget, and robust against differences among microrobot samples. These features are obtained by designing the learning scheme through the comparison of different GP priors and BO settings on a semi-synthetic data set. The developed learning scheme is validated in microrobot experiments, resulting in a 115% improvement in a microrobot's locomotion performance with an experimental budget of only 20 tests. These encouraging results lead the way toward self-adaptive microrobotic systems based on light-controlled soft microrobots and probabilistic learning control.",

        "abstract": "Self-driving vehicles are being increasingly deployed in the wild. One of the most important next hurdles for autonomous driving is how such vehicles will optimally interact with one another and with their surroundings. In this paper, we consider the lane changing problem that is fundamental to road-bound multi-vehicle systems, and approach it through a combination of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and game theory. We introduce a proactive-passive lane changing framework and formulate the lane changing problem as a Markov game between the proactive and passive vehicles. Based on different approaches to carry out DRL to solve the Markov game, we propose an asynchronous lane changing scheme as in a single-agent RL setting and a synchronous cooperative lane changing scheme that takes into consideration the adaptive behavior of the other vehicle in a vehicle's decision. Experimental results show that the synchronous scheme can effectively create and find proper merging moment after sufficient training. The framework and solution developed here demonstrate the potential of using reinforcement learning to solve multi-agent autonomous vehicle tasks such as the lane changing as they are formulated as Markov games.",

We used Gaussian processes to model the motions a human user made in response to applied torques from an ungrounded control moment gyroscope haptic device. We then used Gaussian process dynamic programming to generate optimized haptic cues to guide the user to rotate the device toward 3D targets. We compared the performance of naive and optimized policies in simulations and with a human user, and found that dynamic programming can significantly improve haptic guidance in cases where human responses are highly variable or inconsistent with the cued haptic direction.",

This finger, inspired by previous GelSight sensing techniques (Johnson and Adelson 2009), features an integration that is slimmer, more robust, and with more homogeneous output than previous vision-based tactile sensors. To achieve a compact integration, we redesign the optical path from illumination source to camera by combining light guides and an arrangement of mirror reflections. We parameterize the optical path with geometric design variables and describe the tradeoffs between the finger thickness, camera depth of field, and size of the tactile sensing area. The sensor sustains the wear from continuous use - and abuse - in grasping tasks by combining tougher materials for the compliant gel, a textured fabric skin, a structurally rigid body, and a calibration process that maintains homogeneous illumination and contrast of the tactile images during use. Finally, we evaluate the sensor's durability along four metrics that track the signal quality during more than 3000 grasping experiments.",

        "abstract": "We propose a scalable, parallelizable policy synthesis framework intended for a robot presented with the decision of exploration or rescue, given some time-varying, stochastic mission conditions, referred to as context. We demonstrate the feasibility of such a solution using physics-based simulations to synthesize a policy in a computationally-efficient manner and exhibit superior performance with regards to the minimization of probability of mission failure when compared to two feasible baseline approaches. Furthermore, we present preliminary results that suggest our approach is robust to errors in the state estimation used to build mission context, which further supports the notion of real-world applicability.",

        "abstract": "Conventional deep learning classifiers are static in the sense that they are trained on a predefined set of classes and learning to classify a novel class typically requires re-training. In this work, we address the problem of Low-Shot network-expansion learning. We introduce a learning framework which enables expanding a pre-trained (base) deep network to classify novel classes when the number of examples for the novel classes is particularly small. We present a simple yet powerful hard distillation method where the base network is augmented with additional weights to classify the novel classes, while keeping the weights of the base network unchanged. We show that since only a small number of weights needs to be trained, the hard distillation excels in low-shot training scenarios. Furthermore, hard distillation avoids detriment to classification performance on the base classes. Finally, we show that low-shot network expansion can be done with a very small memory footprint by using a compact generative model of the base classes training data with only a negligible degradation relative to learning with the full training set.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a methodology for modeling and predicting human behavior in settings with N humans interacting in highly multimodal scenarios (i.e. where there are many possible highly-distinct futures). A motivating example includes robots interacting with humans in crowded environments, such as self-driving cars operating alongside human-driven vehicles or human-robot collaborative bin packing in a warehouse. Our approach to model human behavior in such uncertain environments is to model humans in the scene as nodes in a graphical model, with edges encoding relationships between them. For each human, we learn a multimodal probability distribution over future actions from a dataset of multi-human interactions. Learning such distributions is made possible by recent advances in the theory of conditional variational autoencoders and deep learning approximations of probabilistic graphical models. Specifically, we learn action distributions conditioned on interaction history, neighboring human behavior, and candidate future agent behavior in order to take into account response dynamics. We demonstrate the performance of such a modeling approach in modeling basketball player trajectories, a highly multimodal, multi-human scenario which serves as a proxy for many robotic applications.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we propose a purely geometrical approach for the robust matching of line segments for challenging stereo streams with severe illumination changes or High Dynamic Range (HDR) environments. To that purpose, we exploit the univocal nature of the matching problem, i.e. every observation must be corresponded with a single feature or not corresponded at all. We state the problem as a sparse, convex, \u21131-minimization of the matching vector regularized by the geometric constraints. This formulation allows for the robust tracking of line segments along sequences where traditional appearance-based matching techniques tend to fail due to dynamic changes in illumination conditions. Moreover, the proposed matching algorithm also results in a considerable speed-up of previous state of the art techniques making it suitable for real-time applications such as Visual Odometry (VO). This, of course, comes at expense of a slightly lower number of matches in comparison with appearance-based methods, and also limits its application to continuous video sequences, as it is rather constrained to small pose increments between consecutive frames. We validate the claimed advantages by first evaluating the matching performance in challenging video sequences, and then testing the method in a benchmarked point and line based VO algorithm.",

Unlike existing feature selection works that are focused on efficiency only, our method significantly improves the accuracy of pose tracking, while introducing little overhead. By studying the impact of feature selection towards least squares pose optimization, we demonstrate the applicability of improving accuracy via good feature selection. To that end, we introduce the Max-logDet metric to guide the feature selection, which is connected to the conditioning of least squares pose optimization problem. We then describe an efficient algorithm for approximately solving the NP-hard Max-logDet problem. Integrating Max-logDet feature selection into a state-of-the-art visual SLAM system leads to accuracy improvements with low overhead, as demonstrated via evaluation on a public benchmark.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the motion planning framework for a hexapod, based on advanced motions, for accessing challenging spaces, namely narrow pathways and large holes, both of which are surrounded by walls. The advanced motions, wall and chimney walking, utilise environment surfaces that are perpendicular to the ground plane to support the robot motion. Such techniques have not yet been studied in the literature. The hierarchical planning framework proposed here is an extension to existing approaches which have only considered ground walking where foothold contacts are confined to the ground plane. During the pre-processing phase of the 2.5D grid map, the motion primitives employed are assessed for each cell and stacked to the graph if valid. The A* algorithm is then used to find a path to the goal position. Following that, the path is post-processed to smoothen the motions and generate a continuous path. Footholds are then selected along the path. The framework has been evaluated in simulation on the custom-designed Corin hexapod. The resulting path enables access to areas that are previously thought to be inaccessible and reduces the travelling distance compared to previous studies.",

        "abstract": "Reducing material spillage by robotic mining mobile manipulators, such as front-end loaders, is necessary to improve mining operations. To this end, the present work proposes an approach to reduce disturbances on the end-effector induced by the terrain and propagated through the wheels and arm links of the machine. The proposed approach is based on an H\u221e control strategy that includes a feedforward action, computed using the pitch rate of the mobile base, and considers the hydraulic arm dynamics, as well as the reaction forces in the contact points of the mobile base, which is modeled as a floating body with non-permanent ground contacts. Alternative control schemes based on the classic proportional-derivative (PD) control, and the Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC), with and without feedforward action, were also implemented and experimentally evaluated using a semiautonomous Cat\u00ae 262C compact skid-steer loader equipped with inclination and inertial sensors. The proposed method reduces disturbances by at least 70% when climbing ramps at 25% of the machine's maximum speed, and by at least 20% when driving over speed bumps which produce disturbances similar to that caused by stones. The proposed disturbance attenuation strategy should help reducing the spillage of material when driving over mounds, inclines or spilled rocks, especially considering that even if existing autonomous machines are able to drive with little operator supervision along mining galleries, they are often unable to avoid disturbing material on the ground or the characteristic unevenness of mining terrains.",

General models and standard methods for emotion definition and recognition are briefly described, as well as strategies for computing the group global emotion, knowing the individual emotions of group members. This work is based on Ekman's extended \u201cBig Six\u201d emotional model, popular in Computer Science and Affective Computing. Emotion recognition via facial expression analysis is performed with a cloud-computing based solution, using Microsoft Azure Cognitive services. First, the performances of both the Face API to detect faces, and Emotion API, to compute emotion via face expression analysis, are tested. After that, a solution to compute the emotion of a group of people has been implemented and its performances compared to human perceptions. This work presents concepts and strategies which can be generalized for applications within the scope of assistive robotics and, more broadly, affective computing, wherever it will be necessary to determine the emotion of a group of people.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of coverage planning for a particular type of very simple mobile robot. The robot must be able to translate in a commanded direction (specified in a global reference frame), with bounded error on the motion direction, until reaching the environment boundary. The objective, for a given environment map, is to generate a sequence of motions that is guaranteed to cover as large a portion of that environment as possible, in spite of the severe limits on the robot's sensing and actuation abilities. We show how to model the knowledge available to this kind of robot about its own position within the environment, show how to compute the region whose coverage can be guaranteed for a given plan, and characterize regions whose coverage cannot be guaranteed by any plan. We also describe a heuristic algorithm that generates coverage plans for this robot, based on a search across a specially-constructed graph. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.",

Such a capability can be of particular relevance in the context of human-robot cooperation scenarios. This paper proposes a novel approach to utilize the natural brain responses to highlighted objects in the scene for object selection. By this, it circumvents the need for additional interfaces or user training. Our approach uses methods from information geometry to classify the target/non-target response of these event-related potentials. Online experiments carried out with a real robot demonstrate an accurate detection of target objects solely based on the user's attention.",

Motivated by the utilization of visual sensing on board the pursuer, we focus on the case when only bearing measurements are available to the pursuer. The resulting partially-observable interception problem is computationally challenging, and the separation principle does not hold in general. In this paper, we identify a set of maneuvers that improve observability, and we propose an algorithm that utilizes these maneuvers to move the pursuer so that the expected payoff of the differential game is maximized. The algorithm uses in-the-loop uncertainty propagation based on linear covariance analysis to assess the effect of the maneuvers. We evaluate the resulting guidance law in experiments involving a quadcopter in flight representing the pursuer, and a simulated evader.",

Observation of animal behavior such as communication of wild birds would be aided by a portable device implementing a real-time system that can localize sound sources, measure their timing, classify their sources, and visualize these factors of sources. The difficulty of such a system is an integration of these functions considering the real-time requirement. To realize such a system, we propose a cascaded approach, cascading sound source detection, localization, separation, feature extraction, classification, and visualization for bird song analysis. Our system is constructed by combining an open source software for robot audition called HARK and a deep learning library to implement a bird song classifier based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). Considering portability, we implemented this system on a single-board computer, Jetson TX2, with a microphone array and developed a prototype device for bird song scene analysis. A preliminary experiment confirms a computational time for the whole system to realize a real-time system. Also, an additional experiment with a bird song dataset revealed a trade-off relationship between classification accuracy and time consuming and the effectiveness of our classifier.",

Each finger module is powered by a single actuator through an under-actuated transmission and equipped with a sensory system for delicate and precise grasping, which includes absolute position measurements, contact pressure sensing at finger phalanxes and motor current readings. Finally, intrinsic elasticity integrated in the transmission system make the hand robust and adaptive to impacts when interacting with the objects and environment. This highly integrated hand (HERI II) was developed for the Centauro Robot to enable robust and resilient manipulation. A set of experiments demonstrating the hand's grasping performance were carried out and fully verified the design effectiveness of the proposed hand.",

With FPGA acceleration, the SLAM and motion planning tasks are performed 2\u20134 times faster on the HERO platform against fine-tuned software implementation. For CNN inference, it can process 20\u201330 images per second with the network of VGG-16 or ResNet-50.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a hybrid 3D-like grid-based mapping approach, that we called HMAP, used as a reliable and efficient 3D representation of the environment surrounding a mobile robot. Considering 3D point-clouds as input data, the proposed mapping approach addresses the representation of height-voxel (HVoxel) elements inside the HMAP, where free and occupied space is modeled through HVoxels, resulting in a reliable method for 3D representation. The proposed method corrects some of the problems inherent to the representation of complex environments based on 2D and 2.5D representations, while keeping an updated grid representation. Additionally, we also propose a complete pipeline for SLAM based on HMAPs. Indoor and outdoor experiments were carried out to validate the proposed representation using data from a Microsoft Kinect One (indoor) and a Velodyne VLP-16 LiDAR (outdoor). The obtained results show that HMAPs can provide a more detailed view of complex elements in a scene when compared to a classic 2.5D representation. Moreover, validation of the proposed SLAM approach was carried out in an outdoor dataset with promising results, which lay a foundation for further research in the topic.",

Hence, the Vive's off the shelf algorithm is poorly suited for robotics applications such as measuring ground truth poses, where accuracy and repeatability are key. Therefore we introduce a new open-source tracking algorithm and calibration procedure for Vive which address these problems. We also show that our approach improves the pose estimation repeatability and accuracy by up to two orders of magnitude.",

        "abstract": "Many mobile robots rely on 2D laser scanners for localization, mapping, and navigation. However, those sensors are unable to correctly provide distance to obstacles such as glass panels and tables whose actual occupancy is invisible at the height the sensor is measuring. In this work, instead of estimating the distance to obstacles from richer sensor readings such as 3D lasers or RGBD sensors, we present a method to estimate the distance directly from raw 2D laser data. To learn a mapping from raw 2D laser distances to obstacle distances we frame the problem as a learning task and train a neural network formed as an autoencoder. A novel configuration of network hyperparameters is proposed for the task at hand and is quantitatively validated on a test set. Finally, we qualitatively demonstrate in real time on a Care-O-bot 4 that the trained network can successfully infer obstacle distances from partial 2D laser readings.",

The knowledge of how the hand-impedance changes due to training might be useful to inform better training programs and to introduce co-manipulated robotic assistants for effective trainings. Ten novice subjects participated in a three weeks training program for a suturing activity in laparoscopy. The subjects have been instructed to set the needle, enter the skin, and tie knots by using laparoscopic tools within a Minimally Invasive Surgery training box. Variable admittance controlled robots, attached to the tools with force sensors, applied step vice velocity disturbances while subjects were trying to set the needle. Based on the interaction force and end-effector position information, impedances of the left and right hands were computed in four different directions. The computed results were compared with respect to the participants skill progression.",

Our goal is to provide a robust sensor front-end suitable for real-time human-robot interaction using face-engagement and gestures. Using hand-labelled videos obtained from real human-UAV interaction experiments, we re-trained the YOLOv2 Deep Convolutional Neural Network to detect only hands and faces. This model was then used to automatically label several much larger third-party datasets. After manual correction of these results, we modified and re-trained the model on all this labelled data. We obtain qualitatively good detection results at 60Hz on a commodity GPU: our simultaneous hand-and-face detector gives state of the art accuracy and speed in a hand detection benchmark and competitive results in a face detection benchmark. To demonstrate its effectiveness for human-robot interaction we describe its use as the input to a simple but practical gestural human-UAV interface for entertainment or industrial applications.

Studies show that the cognitive burden of interfacing with a robotic assistant decreases with increased robot autonomy. Incorporating modern advances in perception with augmented reality, this paper describes a framework for obtaining high-level intents from the user to specify manipulation tasks for execution. Augmented reality glasses provide an egocentric perspective to the robot. The glasses also provide visual feedback to users on a virtual menu showing a summary of robot affordances. The system processes the vision input to interpret the users environment. A Tongue Drive System serves as the input modality for triggering task execution by the robotic arm. Several manipulation experiments are performed with comparison to Cartesian control. The outcomes are also compared to reported state-of-the-art approaches. The results demonstrate competitive performance with minimal user input requirements.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Robotic and computer assistance can bring significant benefits to endovascular procedures in terms of precision and stability, reduced radiation doses, improved comfort and access to difficult and tortuous anatomy. However, the design of current commercially available platforms tends to alter the natural bedside manipulation skills of the operator, so that the manually acquired experience and dexterity are not well utilized. Furthermore, most of these systems lack of haptic feedback, preventing their acceptance and limiting the clinical usability. In this paper a new robotic platform for endovascular catheterization, the CathBot, is presented. It is an ergonomic master-slave system with navigation system and integrated vision-based haptic feedback, designed to maintain the natural bedside skills of the vascular surgeon. Unlike previous work reported in literature, dynamic motion tracking of both the vessel walls the catheter tip is incorporated to create dynamic active constraints. The system was evaluated through a combined quantitative and qualitative user study simulating catheterization tasks on a phantom. Forces exerted on the phantom were measured. The results showed a 70% decrease in mean force and 61% decrease in maximum force when force feedback is provided. This research provides the first integration of vision-based dynamic active constraints within an ergonomic robotic catheter manipulator. The technological advances presented here, demonstrates that vision-based haptic feedback can improve the effectiveness, precision, and safety of robot-assisted endovascular procedures.",

        "abstract": "Robotic wheelchairs with built-in assistive features, such as shared control, are an emerging means of providing independent mobility to severely disabled individuals. However, patients often struggle to build a mental model of their wheelchair's behaviour under different environmental conditions. Motivated by the desire to help users bridge this gap in perception, we propose a novel augmented reality system using a Microsoft Hololens as a head-mounted aid for wheelchair navigation. The system displays visual feedback to the wearer as a way of explaining the underlying dynamics of the wheelchair's shared controller and its predicted future states. To investigate the influence of different interface design options, a pilot study was also conducted. We evaluated the acceptance rate and learning curve of an immersive wheelchair training regime, revealing preliminary insights into the potential beneficial and adverse nature of different augmented reality cues for assistive navigation. In particular, we demonstrate that care should be taken in the presentation of information, with effort-reducing cues for augmented information acquisition (for example, a rear-view display) being the most appreciated.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In Japan, inspection of irrigation water canals has been mostly conducted manually. However, the huge demand for more regular inspections as infrastructure ages, coupled with the limited time window available for inspection, has rendered manual inspection increasingly insufficient. With shortened inspection time and reduced labor cost, automated inspection using a combination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground vehicles (cars) has emerged as an attractive alternative to manual inspection. In this paper, we propose a path planning framework that generates optimal plans for UAVs and cars to inspect water canals in a large agricultural area (tens of square kilometers). In addition to optimality, the paths need to satisfy several constraints, in order to guarantee UAV navigation safety and to abide by local traffic regulations. In the proposed framework, the canal and road networks are first modeled as two graphs, which are then partitioned into smaller subgraphs that can be covered by a given fleet of UAVs within one battery charge. The problem of finding optimal paths for both UAVs and cars on the graphs, subject to the constraints, is formulated as a integer quadratic program (IQP). The proposed framework can also quickly generate new plans when a current plan is interrupted. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated by simulation results showing the successful generation of plans covering all given canal segments, and the ability to quickly revise the plan when conditions change.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a hierarchical path planner consisting of two stages: a global planner that uses workspace information to create collision-free paths for the robot end-effector to follow, and multiple local planners running in parallel that verify the paths in the configuration space by expanding a task-space rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT). We demonstrate the practicality of our approach by comparing it with state-of-the-art planners in several challenging path planning problems. While using a single tree, our planner outperforms other single tree approaches in task-space or configuration space (C-space), while its performance and robustness are comparable to or better than that of parallelized bidirectional C-space planners.",

This video presents a novel multi-fingered robot hand for extreme environments without a sufficient electric supply. The robot hand has four fingers with 16 joints and 12 degrees of freedom. The finger has a retention mechanism using no electrical power supply and a fingertip force of 150 [N]. Holding without power supply shows that our robot hand can lift a heavy barbell and keep its posture without using electrical power. The high fingertip force shows that steel cans can be crushed by the robot hand. In addition, dexterous motion of our robot hand shows that each finger allows flexion/extension and adduction/abduction. High-power manipulation shows that the robot hand can grasp and manipulate a hammer drill for making a hole in a concrete plate. The robot hand has a high potential for performing various tasks by obtaining high power output and electrical power saving.",

This paper proposes a method for generating a high-speed stealth walking gait without including double-limb support phase, and discusses the effect of upper-body control and semicircular feet on the gait properties. First, we introduce a model of a 3-link planar underactuated biped with an upper body and semicircular feet, and derive the approximate target initial state of the upper body by using the linearized equation of motion. Second, we conduct numerical simulations of the nonlinear model to observe the typical stealth walking gaits, and analyze the changing tendency of the upper body motion with respect to the foot radius. Furthermore, we discuss the advantage of semicircular feet through parametric studies of the gait efficiencies.",

Previous researches have found that sensing from fingertips equipped with proximity sensors is available for the requirements, because it complements blind areas of vision sensors. In this paper, we develop a novel optical proximity sensor for robot fingertips which provides two levels of proximity information with different purposes, sampling rates, information quantity and quality. The lower-level information from the sensor is for high-speed feedback control of a robotic hand, and the higher-level information is for recognizing the shape and size of an object. A prototype of the sensor with 5 \u00d7 5 matrix of photo detectors is presented, and its availability is shown through basic characteristic tests. A motion experiment using a robotic hand equipped with the prototype sensors is also conducted. The result confirms that the robotic hand can adjust the position and orientation of the fingertips to various objects and then correct the grasping form according to the object size within 1s.",

        "abstract": "Many scenarios require a robot to be able to explore its 3D environment online without human supervision. This is especially relevant for inspection tasks and search and rescue missions. To solve this high-dimensional path planning problem, sampling-based exploration algorithms have proven successful. However, these do not necessarily scale well to larger environments or spaces with narrow openings. This paper presents a 3D exploration planner based on the principles of Next-Best Views (NBVs). In this approach, a Micro-Aerial Vehicle (MAV)equipped with a limited field-of-view depth sensor randomly samples its configuration space to find promising future viewpoints. In order to obtain high sampling efficiency, our planner maintains and uses a history of visited places, and locally optimizes the robot's orientation with respect to unobserved space. We evaluate our method in several simulated scenarios, and compare it against a state-of-the-art exploration algorithm. The experiments show substantial improvements in exploration time (2 \u2a2f faster), computation time, and path length, and advantages in handling difficult situations such as escaping dead-ends (up to 20 \u2a2f faster). Finally, we validate the on-line capability of our algorithm on a computational constrained real world MAV.",

        "abstract": "Gaze provides subtle informative cues to aid fluent interactions among people. Incorporating human gaze predictions can signify how engaged a person is while interacting with a robot and allow the robot to predict a human's intentions or goals. We propose a novel approach to predict human gaze fixations relevant for human-robot interaction tasks-both referential and mutual gaze-in real time on a robot. We use a deep learning approach which tracks a human's gaze from a robot's perspective in real time. The approach builds on prior work which uses a deep network to predict the referential gaze of a person from a single 2D image. Our work uses an interpretable part of the network, a gaze heat map, and incorporates contextual task knowledge such as location of relevant objects, to predict referential gaze. We find that the gaze heat map statistics also capture differences between mutual and referential gaze conditions, which we use to predict whether a person is facing the robot's camera or not. We highlight the challenges of following a person's gaze on a robot in real time and show improved performance for referential gaze and mutual gaze prediction.",

        "abstract": "In human-robot collaboration, the robot is required to provide assistance to the user by facilitating task execution. However, due to stability requirements, a well-damped admittance behavior of the robot is necessary during interaction, thus inducing fatigue in the operator. While available schemes involve variable impedance controllers to mitigate this effect, here we propose an alternative approach entailing a proactive robot behavior that assists in the cooperative execution of trajectories towards desired goals, by estimating the user intention. To this end, we make use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to predict and classify cooperative motions, on the basis of a set of predefined goals in the workspace and model-based generated data of human movements. Manual guidance validation experiments are conducted on a 6 d.o.f. ABB IRB140 industrial robot equipped with a force sensor.",

        "abstract": "Intuitive exoskeleton control is fundamental since it contributes to improved user acceptance and wearability comfort. This requires the detection of user's motion intention and its incorporation into the exoskeleton control system. In this work, we propose a classification system based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which facilitates the online classification of multi-modal sensor data acquired from a lower-limb exoskeleton based on previously defined motion patterns. For classification of these motion patterns at each time step, we consider the most recent sensor measurements by using a sliding window approach. We collected a training data set from a total number of 10 subjects performing 13 different motions with a passive exoskeleton equipped with 7 3D-force sensors and 3 inertial measurement units (IMUs). Our evaluation includes an analysis of the time needed for correct classification (latency), a validation for a training set containing all subjects and a leave-one-out validation to assess the generalization performance of the approach. The results indicate that our approach can classify motions of subjects included in the training set with an average accuracy of 92.80% and is able to achieve a generalization performance of 84.46%. With the selected parameters an average latency of 368.97 ms is achieved.",

        "abstract": "Accurate long-term prediction of human motion in populated spaces is an important but difficult task for mobile robots and intelligent vehicles. What makes this task challenging is that human motion is influenced by a large variety of factors including the person's intention, the presence, attributes, actions, social relations and social norms of other surrounding agents, and the geometry and semantics of the environment. In this paper, we consider the problem of computing human motion predictions that account for such factors. We formulate the task as an MDP planning problem with stochastic policies and propose a weighted random walk algorithm in which each agent is locally influenced by social forces from other nearby agents. The novelty of this paper is that we incorporate social grouping information into the prediction process reflecting the soft formation constraints that groups typically impose to their members' motion. We show that our method makes more accurate predictions than three state-of-the-art methods in terms of probabilistic and geometrical performance metrics.",

Co-bots can be equipped with vision sensors and cognitive software layers, allowing the robot to figure out human intentions. To make this level of perception possible, human pose estimation algorithms are required. Several techniques have been already proposed to tackle this problem, which however present some weaknesses in particular when occlusions occur. This work proposes an algorithm for human pose estimation in the situations of partial occlusion, based on particle filter techniques. We have proved its validity in a realistic human-robot coexistence scenario, where a human and a dual arm robot have to perform tasks in a shared workspace.",

This physical interaction system is designed to handle, transport, or manipulate large objects of different shapes in cooperation with a human. Unique points are the bi-manual physical cooperation, the sequential characteristic of the cooperation including contact changes, and a novel architecture combining force interaction cues, interactive search-based planning, and online trajectory and motion generation. The resulting system implements a mixed initiative collaboration strategy, deferring to the human when his intentions are unclear, and driving the task once understood. This results in an easy and intuitive human-robot interaction. It is evaluated in simulations and on a bi-manual mobile robot with 32 degrees of freedom.",

In order to solve this problem, motion planning framework has been proposed that adapts the robot's movement (path and speed)according to the human movement or any other dynamic obstacles in real time. Firstly, it defines the safety distance between robot and human or other obstacles. During run-time the 3D-Smart-Sensors capture the current position of human and other dynamic/static obstacles in human-robot shared workspace. The proposed framework plans and optimizes collision free robot trajectories with consideration for safety distance, path length and executing time. Once a new optimal trajectory is found, the framework controls the robot to adjust its movement paths. Moreover, the proposed framework can adjust the robot velocity based on the 3D-Zone Model of human-robot shared workspace.

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Humanoids' abilities to navigate stairs and uneven terrain make them well-suited for disaster response efforts. However, humanoid navigation in such environments is currently limited by the capabilities of navigation planners. Such planners typically consider only footstep locations, but planning with palm contacts may be necessary to cross a gap, avoid an obstacle, or maintain balance. However, considering palm contacts greatly increases the branching factor of the search, leading to impractical planning times for large environments. In previous work we explored using library-based methods to address difficult navigation planning problems requiring palm contacts, but such methods are not efficient when navigating an easy-to-traverse part of the environment. To maximize planning efficiency, we would like to use discrete planners when an area is easy to traverse and switch to the library-based method only when traversal becomes difficult. Thus, in this paper we present a method that 1) Plans a guiding torso path which accounts for the difficulty of traversing the environment as predicted by learned regressors; and 2) Decomposes the guiding path into a set of segments, each of which is assigned a motion mode (i.e. a set of feet and hands to use) and a planning method. Easily-traversable segments are assigned a discrete-search planner, while other segments are assigned a library-based method that fits existing motion plans to the environment near the given segment. Our results suggest that this segmentation approach greatly outperforms standard discrete planning and that using the library-based method for more difficult segments gives a benefit over using discrete planning.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a humanoid robot center of mass (COM) estimation framework based on the compliant inverted pendulum model and the robust estimator. Humanoids' limited structural stiffness and relatively long legs result in undesired flexibility, and this undesired motion hinders the state estimation. The models used in previous studies were either not suitable for estimation or too simple to express these key characteristics of humanoid robots. Here, to enhance the estimation performance, the compliant inverted pendulum model, which is developed by attaching a spring and damper to the original pendulum, is adopted. The additional elements can represent the mechanical deformation and undesired flexibility. This model can reflect the important characteristics of the humanoid robot while taking advantage of the merits of the sing-mass model. In addition, a robust state estimator that was proposed in our previous work is adopted to compensate for an estimation error caused by a modeling error. Using these two factors, an improved COM kinematics estimates could be obtained.",

The operator is given command over the humanoid's hands and is informed through haptic cues about the impact of her/his potential actions on the robot\u2019 stability. Moreover, a null-space autonomous controller acts in the operator's null-space to provide her/him with a wider workspace and help in the successful execution of the task.

Experiments on the humanoid robot TORO are reported to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach.",

One of the main challenges is how to automatically obtain a consistent and correct description of human context such as location, activities, emotions, etc. In this paper, a new hybrid approach for reasoning on the context is proposed. This approach focuses on human activity recognition and consists of machine-learning algorithms, an expressive ontology representation, and a reasoning system. The latter allows detecting the inconsistencies that may appear during the machine learning phase. The proposed approach can also correct automatically these inconsistencies by considering the context of the ongoing activity. The obtained results on the Opportunity dataset demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method to enhance the performance of human activity recognition.",

By combining both linear subspace methods and deep convolutional prediction, HBEOs efficiently learn nonlinear object representations without directly regressing into high-dimensional space. HBEOs also remove the onerous and generally impractical necessity of input data voxelization prior to inference. We experimentally evaluate the suitability of HBEOs to the challenging task of joint pose, class, and shape inference on novel objects and show that, compared to preceding work, HBEOs offer dramatically improved performance in all three tasks along with several orders of magnitude faster runtime performance.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The factor graph framework is a convenient modeling technique for robotic state estimation where states are represented as nodes, and measurements are modeled as factors. When designing a sensor fusion framework for legged robots, one often has access to visual, inertial, joint encoder, and contact sensors. While visual-inertial odometry has been studied extensively in this framework, the addition of a preintegrated contact factor for legged robots has been only recently proposed. This allowed for integration of encoder and contact measurements into existing factor graphs, however, new nodes had to be added to the graph every time contact was made or broken. In this work, to cope with the problem of switching contact frames, we propose a hybrid contact preintegration theory that allows contact information to be integrated through an arbitrary number of contact switches. The proposed hybrid modeling approach reduces the number of required variables in the nonlinear optimization problem by only requiring new states to be added alongside camera or selected keyframes. This method is evaluated using real experimental data collected from a Cassie-series robot where the trajectory of the robot produced by a motion capture system is used as a proxy for ground truth. The evaluation shows that inclusion of the proposed preintegrated hybrid contact factor alongside visual-inertial navigation systems improves estimation accuracy as well as robustness to vision failure, while its generalization makes it more accessible for legged platforms.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Visual servoing is a well-known task in robotics. However, there are still challenges when multiple visual sources are combined to accurately guide the robot or occlusions appear. In this paper we present a novel visual servoing approach using hybrid multi-camera input data to lead a robot arm accurately to dynamically moving target points in the presence of partial occlusions. The approach uses four RGBD sensors as Eye-to-Hand (EtoH) visual input, and an arm-mounted stereo camera as Eye-in-Hand (EinH). A Master supervisor task selects between using the EtoH or the EinH, depending on the distance between the robot and target. The Master also selects the subset of EtoH cameras that best perceive the target. When the EinH sensor is used, if the target becomes occluded or goes out of the sensor's view-frustum, the Master switches back to the EtoH sensors to re-track the object. Using this adaptive visual input data, the robot is then controlled using an iterative planner that uses position, orientation and joint configuration to estimate the trajectory. Since the target is dynamic, this trajectory is updated every time-step. Experiments show good performance in four different situations: tracking a ball, targeting a bulls-eye, guiding a straw to a mouth and delivering an item to a moving hand.

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on numerical methods that can be used to identify hydrodynamic parameters of submerged bodies, namely added mass, linear and quadratic friction coefficients. The mechanical setup is a free decay pendulum that is equipped with an encoder. The first contribution of this paper deals with the comparison of two estimation methods: one method that fits the acceleration of the dynamical model with the acceleration obtained from derivatives of the measured angular position, and another method that fits this position with the angle obtained by numerical integration. The second contribution consists of investigating to what extent estimated added mass and friction coefficient parameters of the dynamical model match the empirical or theoretical values in the case of a spherical object. The results obtained show that the numerical integration method allows to determine the added mass with a good accuracy and a single friction coefficient could be used for the dynamic model without loosing validity.",

We use a tool-mounted gaze tracking system, which, after modelling via a pilot study, we use as a proxy for estimating the attention of the user. This information is then used for cooperation with users in a task of selecting and engaging with objects on a dynamic screen. Via a video game setup, we test various degrees of robot autonomy from fully autonomous, where the robot knows what it has to do and acts, to no autonomy where the user is in full control of the task. Our results measure performance and subjective metrics and show how the attention model benefits the interaction and preference of users.",

The habit estimation system uses the information provided by an activity recognition module, which provides the sequence and the duration of the activities performed by the user. Based on those parameters, the activities are represented as a signal by using Fourier series representation. Several output signals from different users are clustered into groups using the k-means method, where each cluster corresponds to a specific habit from a group of people. The proposed system was tested with dataset from the experiment that took place in an environment similar to a smart house. The users were asked to perform a set of 6 activities in any desired orders. In total, twenty-four subjects took part in the experiments. All activities were successfully recognized by the system and three different habits were found. The proposed system along with its habit representation can be potentially used to trace the relationships between the habits observed and some aspects of the user personality traits.",

        "abstract": "Objects in space often exhibit a tumbling motion around the major inertial axis. In this paper, we address the image based visual servoing of a robotic system towards an uncooperative tumbling object. In contrast to previous approaches that require explicit reconstruction of the object and an estimation of its velocity, we propose a novel controller that is able to minimize the feature error directly in image space. This is achieved by observing that the feature points on the tumbling object follow a circular path around the axis of rotation and their projection creates an elliptical track in the image plane. Our controller minimizes the error between this elliptical track and the desired features, such that at the desired pose the features lie on the circumference of the ellipse. The effectiveness of our framework is exhibited by implementing the algorithm in simulation as well on a mobile robot.",

A thorough validation of the proposed controller has been conducted in simulated and real flight scenarios, demonstrating outstanding capabilities in object following applications. Moreover, we conduct a detailed comparison of the RL-IBVS controller with respect to classic and partitioned IBVS approaches.",

Force information is required for precise object manipulation but is difficult to obtain because the acting and reaction forces cannot be separated. To separate the forces, we proposed to introduce bilateral control, in which the acting and reaction forces are divided using two robots. In the proposed method, two models of neural networks learn a task; to draw a line along a ruler. We verify the possibility that force information is essential to imitate the human skill of object manipulation.",

        "abstract": "This paper demonstrates the experimental validation of canonical peg-in-hole manipulation task using an aerial robot. The robot consists of a multirotor platform equipped with a dual arm multi degree of freedom manipulator. The paper discusses the introduced kinematic constraints which make sure the robot holds a bolt with both arms. We build our peg-in-hole approach using impedance control which is the foundation of compliant interaction with the environment. We utilize a finite state automaton to plan a multi stage strategy which relies on tactile perception in order to pin point the target. Finally, the whole body locomotion is considered, meaning both the degrees of freedom of multirotor base and the dual arm manipulator are considered.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a 1-link robotic arm that is antagonistically driven by one pair of a high performance super-coiled polymer actuators with an embedded controller. The actuator which is made from Spandex and nylon fibers is low-cost, easy to fabricate and light-weight. Moreover, it can generate large displacement and provide Joule heating capability. The main contribution of the paper is the model-based impedance controller, which enables position control of the antagonistic joint with variable stiffness and damping. The impedance control is a torque-based law, which in turn depends on a proposed backstepping control law to control the force of each actuator. The control system is proved to be stable using dissipativity stability theory and verified through experiments. Experimental results show that our system can track the angular position reference with the worst position error of 0.43deg and root-mean squared error of 0.16deg at steady state for sinusoidal waveform tracking (with the frequency of 0.1Hz), and the worst position error of 0.2deg for set-point regulation.",

To address such practical challenges, this paper presents an enhanced teleoperator interface incorporating multi-modal augmented reality, and new method of telerobotic operation based on perceptual overlay - `virtual fixtures'. Rather than trying to devise complex robotic systems, innovation is directed to enhancement of teleoperator interface so as to draw more performance and intuition from the human operator. Particular enhancements were made over the current technology basis in 3D sensing and reconstruction, virtual fixture generation, and operator interface. The telerobotic system was developed using ROS (Robot Operating System) to streamline system integration and resource sharing. The presented innovation is expected to allow deployment of simple and rugged robots to perform dexterous manipulation of heavy objects.",

Many conventional position control-based legged robots have high gear ratios, but do not have joint torque sensors. In addition, some robots cannot generate current for controlling the motor torque. To apply torque control-based walking algorithms to a position control-based humanoid robot, we proposed current control using a motor thermal model and realized joint torque control by compensating for the joint dynamics and robot dynamics. We conducted experiments to verify the performance of the Hubo2 platform developed in 2008 by applying a full-body dynamics control framework. The results confirmed the possibility of using torque control algorithms with existing position-based robots.",

The novel vehicle has improved torque disturbance rejection capabilities compared to a standard quadcopter. An analysis of the vehicle dynamics shows that the effect of torque disturbances decreases monotonically with increasing angular momentum of the momentum wheel. A framework for choosing the mass moment of inertia and speed of the momentum wheel is given based on an upper bound on the allowable energy stored in the wheel. Theoretical results are experimentally validated by comparing responses to torque impulses applied to the vehicle with and without the momentum wheel spinning.",

        "abstract": "A common solution criterion for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is to maximize the expected sum of exponentially discounted rewards, for which a variety of approximate methods have been proposed. Those that plan in the belief space typically provide tighter performance guarantees, but those that plan over the state space (e.g., QMDP and FIB) often require much less memory and computation. This paper presents an encouraging result that shows that reducing the discount factor while planning in the state space can actually improve performance significantly when evaluated on the original problem. This phenomenon is confirmed by both a theoretical analysis as well as a series of empirical studies on benchmark problems. As predicted by the theory and confirmed empirically, the phenomenon is most prominent when the observation model is noisy or rewards are sparse.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has been very successful at learning control policies for robotic agents in order to perform various tasks, such as driving around a track, navigating a maze, and bipedal locomotion. One significant drawback of reinforcement learning methods is that they require a large number of data points in order to learn good policies, a trait known as poor data efficiency or poor sample efficiency. One approach for improving sample efficiency is supervised pre-training of policies to directly clone the behavior of an expert, but this suffers from poor generalization far from the training data. We propose to improve this by using Gaussian dropout networks with a regularization term based on variational inference in the pre-training step. We show that this initializes policy parameters to significantly better values than standard supervised learning or random initialization, thus greatly reducing sample complexity compared with state-of-the-art methods, and enabling an RL algorithm to learn optimal policies for high-dimensional continuous control problems in a practical time frame.",

Repeatability prescribes that experiments should involve several trials in order to guarantee that results are not achieved by chance, but are systematic, and statistically significant trends can be identified. In this paper, we propose an approach to improve the repeatability of experiments performed in robotics. In particular, we focus on the domain of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) and we introduce a system that exploits simulations to generate a large number of test data on which SLAM algorithms are automatically evaluated in order to obtain consistent results, according to the principle of repeatability.",

        "abstract": "We present an evaluation of several representative sampling-based and optimization-based motion planners, and then introduce an integrated motion planning system which incorporates recent advances in trajectory optimization into a sparse roadmap framework. Through experiments in 4 common application scenarios with 5000 test cases each, we show that optimization-based or sampling-based planners alone are not effective for realistic problems where fast planning times are required. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that presents such a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art motion planners, which are based on a significant amount of experiments. We then combine different stand-alone planners with trajectory optimization. The results show that the combination of our sparse roadmap and trajectory optimization provides superior performance over other standard sampling-based planners' combinations. By using a multi-query roadmap instead of generating completely new trajectories for each planning problem, our approach allows for extensions such as persistent control policy information associated with a trajectory across planning problems. Also, the sub-optimality resulting from the sparsity of roadmap, as well as the unexpected disturbances from the environment, can both be overcome by the real-time trajectory optimization process.",

        "abstract": "Behavior Trees (BTs) have become a popular framework for designing controllers of autonomous agents in the computer game and in the robotics industry. One of the key advantages of BTs lies in their modularity, where independent modules can be composed to create more complex ones. In the classical formulation of BTs, modules can be composed using one of the three operators: Sequence, Fallback, and Parallel. The Parallel operator is rarely used despite its strong potential against other control architectures such as Finite State Machines. This is due to the fact that concurrent actions may lead to unexpected problems similar to the ones experienced in concurrent programming. In this paper, we outline how to tackle the aforementioned problem by introducing Concurrent BTs (CBTs) as a generalization of BTs in which we include the notions of progress and resource usage. We show how CBTs allow safe concurrent executions of actions and we analyze the approach from a mathematical standpoint. To illustrate the use of CBTs, we provide a set of use cases in realistic robotics scenarios.",

We employ the DeepLab architecture, based on the ResNet deep network, which leverages multi-scale inputs to later fuse their responses to perform a precise pixel labeling of the scene. This semantic segmentation mask is used to localize the objects and to recognize the scene, following two simple yet effective strategies. We evaluate the benefits of our solutions, performing a thorough experimental evaluation on the NYU Depth V2 dataset. Our approach achieves a performance that beats the leading results by a significant margin, defining the new state of the art in this benchmark for the three tasks comprising the scene understanding: semantic segmentation, object detection and scene categorization.",

        "abstract": "The most widely used methods for toolpath planning in fused deposition 3D printing slice the input model into successive 2D layers in order to construct the toolpath. Unfortunately slicing-based methods can incur a substantial amount of wasted motion (i.e., the extruder is moving while not printing), particularly when features of the model are spatially separated. In recent work we have introduced a new paradigm that constructs the toolpath in 3D and prints local features to minimize wasted motion. Our algorithm is based on a local search and we have demonstrated substantial improvements in the efficiency of the resulting toolpaths. Our approach is amenable to incorporating physical constraints of the 3D printing process, and, in this paper we extend our approach to incorporate kinematic properties into toolpath optimization. With an accurate kinematic model of the extruder, our algorithm is able to model the real-world fabrication time of the model with a high degree of accuracy. To our knowledge, this toolpath optimization algorithm is the first to encode real-world fabrication time as the objective function. We demonstrate the real-world improvement in fabrication time that is possible with our algorithm on a benchmark of almost 600 models. We find improvement in nearly every toolpath generated for our benchmark set (with a mean of 3.2%), but substantially larger improvements for some models. To rationalize these results, we introduce a metric for model characterization that we call \u201coriented compactness\u201d and show that it correlates positively with our observations. We believe this metric can be an important tool in the setup of fabrication (e.g., by guiding an orientation search of the model).",

However, current systems have limited perceptual capabilities in the sense that they are not very well adaptable to unknown environments. Human operators, on the other hand, are experts in adapting to previously unknown information. Hence, human-robot teaming in which the human helps the robot to adapt to new environments and the robot assists in automated object recognition to efficiently feed the control environment of the operator is advantageous. In this work, we propose an object recognition and localization system for mobile robots, based on deep learning, and we study the adaptation of the resulting robotic perception to a new environment. We propose two methods to teach the robot a new object category: using prior knowledge and using limited operator input. We conducted several experiments to show the feasibility of proposed methods.",

We present a system that incrementally builds a database of objects as a mobile agent traverses a scene. Our approach requires no prior knowledge of the shapes present in the scene. Object-like segments are extracted from a global segmentation map, which is built online using the input of segmented RGB-D images. These segments are stored in a database, matched among each other, and merged with other previously observed instances. This allows us to create and improve object models on the fly and to use these merged models to reconstruct also unobserved parts of the scene. The database contains each (potentially merged) object model only once, together with a set of poses where it was observed. We evaluate our pipeline with one public dataset, and on a newly created Google Tango dataset containing four indoor scenes with some of the objects appearing multiple times, both within and across scenes.",

        "abstract": "The Label Propagation (LP) algorithm, first introduced by Zhu and Ghahramani [1], is a semi-supervised method used in transductive learning scenarios, where all data are available already in the beginning. In this work, we present a novel extension of the LP algorithm for applications where data samples are observed sequentially - as is the case in autonomous driving. Specifically, our \u201cIncremental Label Propagation\u201d algorithm efficiently approximates the so called harmonic solution on a nearest-neighbor graph that is regularly updated by new labeled and unlabeled nodes. We achieve this by reformulating the original algorithm based on an active set of nodes and by introducing a threshold to decide whether the label of a given node should be updated or not. Our method can also deal with graphs that are not fully connected, and we give a formal convergence proof for this general case. In experiments on the challenging KITTI benchmark data stream, we show superior performance in terms of both test accuracy and number of required training labels compared to state-of-the-art online learning methods.",

In the past decade, dynamical systems (DS) have arisen as a flexible and robust tool to represent learned skills and to generate motion trajectories. This work presents a novel approach to incrementally modify the dynamics of a generic autonomous DS when new demonstrations of a task are provided. A control input is learned from demonstrations to modify the trajectory of the system while preserving the stability properties of the reshaped DS. Learning is performed incrementally through Gaussian process regression, increasing the robot's knowledge of the skill every time a new demonstration is provided.

        "abstract": "Indoor localization for pedestrians has gained increasing popularity among the rich body of literature for the last decade. In this paper, a low-cost indoor mapping and localization solution is proposed using the opportunistic signals from ambient indoor environments with a smartphone. It is composed of GraphSLAM-based offline mapping and Bayesian filtering-based online localization using generated signal maps. The GraphSLAM front-end is constructed by motion constraints from pedestrian dead-reckoning (PDR), loop-closure constraints identified by magnetic sequence matching with WiFi signal similarity validation, and observation constraints from opportunistic magnetic headings after error rejection. Globally consistent trajectories are created by graph optimization, after which signal maps (e.g., WiFi, magnetic fields, lights) are generated by Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR) for later localization. We propose to use the pseudo-wall constraints from the GPR variance map of magnetic fields and the lights measurements as observations for particle filtering. The proposed method is evaluated on several datasets collected from both the in-compass office buildings and outside public areas. Real-time localization is demonstrated on a smartphone in an office building covering 2000 square meters with the 50- and 90-percentile accuracies being 2.30 m and 3.41 m, respectively.",

The velocity and attitude estimation is possible since the filter employs a linear drag model measuring the drag forces on the quadrotor through the IMU. These forces are functions of the robot's velocity and attitude. In addition, the filter estimates the linear drag parameters and thrust coefficient for the propellers. These parameters may be fed back into a controller to improve tracking performance. Experimental results are used to validate the proposed approach.",

While robot teleoperation is typically performed on low to medium levels of abstraction, automated planning has to take place on a higher abstraction level, i.e. by means of semantic reasoning. Accordingly, an abstract state of the world has to be maintained in order to enable an operator to switch seamlessly between both operational modes. We propose a novel approach that combines simulation based geometric tracking and semantic state inference by means of so called State Inference Entities to overcome this issue. We also demonstrate how Evolutionary Strategies can be employed to refine simulation parameters.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel approach to tightly couple visual and inertial measurements in a fixed-lag visual-inertial odometry (VIO) framework using information sparsification. To bound computational complexity, fixed-lag smoothers typically marginalize out variables, but consequently introduce a densely connected linear prior which significantly deteriorates accuracy and efficiency. Current state-of-the-art approaches account for the issue by selectively discarding measurements and marginalizing additional variables. However, such strategies are sub-optimal from an information-theoretic perspective. Instead, our approach performs a dense marginalization step and preserves the information content of the dense prior. Our method sparsifies the dense prior with a nonlinear factor graph by minimizing the information loss. The resulting factor graph maintains information sparsity, structural similarity, and nonlinearity. To validate our approach, we conduct real-time drone tests and perform comparisons to current state-of-the-art fixed-lag VIO methods in the EuRoC visual-inertial dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive and superior accuracy in almost all trials. We include a detailed run-time analysis to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is suitable for real-time applications.",

        "abstract": "Belt conveyors are transport systems composed by a plurality of belt lines. When those systems are used to transport fragile materials or liquid containers, it is necessary to minimize the oscillations of the transported objects in order to avoid damage, spillage and particle degradation. Those oscillations are regularly caused by steps (i.e. differences in level) at the joints of the belt lines, and for that reason, it is necessary to inspect those steps during installation and maintenance. Regular inspections involve the visual verification of the steps, which stops production, takes significant time, occasionally requires system disassembly and is subjected to human errors. In this paper, a novel belt conveyor inspection system which is able to detect and measure the steps at the joints of the belt lines is presented. This system consists in the acquirement of data of the belt conveyor with an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and the processing of this data with original algorithms for zero offset filtering, sensor progressing direction detection, step event detection and step height calculation. The presented system had successfully detected and measured the steps of a complex belt conveyor with an accuracy of \u00b10.3 mm. It is demonstrated that this cost-effective and ready to use system enables an automatic and prompt inspection of the whole belt conveyor system at once, thus reducing the workload, time and errors of the belt conveyor inspection.",

        "abstract": "We present a robotic system for picking a target from a pile of objects that is capable of finding and grasping the target object by removing obstacles in the appropriate order. The fundamental idea is to segment instances with both visible and occluded masks, which we call `instance occlusion segmentation'. To achieve this, we extend an existing instance segmentation model with a novel `relook' architecture, in which the model explicitly learns the inter-instance relationship. Also, by using image synthesis, we make the system capable of handling new objects without human annotations. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the relook architecture when compared with a conventional model and of the image synthesis when compared to a human-annotated dataset. We also demonstrate the capability of our system to achieve picking a target in a cluttered environment with a real robot.",

        "abstract": "In partially observed environments, it can be useful for a human to provide the robot with declarative information that represents probabilistic relational constraints on properties of objects in the world, augmenting the robot's sensory observations. For instance, a robot tasked with a search-and-rescue mission may be informed by the human that two victims are probably in the same room. An important question arises: how should we represent the robot's internal knowledge so that this information is correctly processed and combined with raw sensory information? In this paper, we provide an efficient belief state representation that dynamically selects an appropriate factoring, combining aspects of the belief when they are correlated through information and separating them when they are not. This strategy works in open domains, in which the set of possible objects is not known in advance, and provides significant improvements in inference time over a static factoring, leading to more efficient planning for complex partially observed tasks. We validate our approach experimentally in two open-domain planning problems: a 2D discrete gridworld task and a 3D continuous cooking task.

Commonly addressed as a separate step from the final execution, in-hand manipulation allows the robot to reorient an object within the end-effector for the successful outcome of the goal task. A joint achievement of repositioning the object and moving the manipulator towards its desired final pose saves time in the execution and introduces more flexibility in the system. We address this problem using a pivoting strategy (i.e. in-hand rotation)for repositioning the object and we integrate this strategy with a path planner for the execution of a complex task. This method is applied on a Baxter robot and its efficacy is shown by experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Search and rescue operations in the context of emergency response to human or natural disasters have the major goal of finding potential victims in the shortest possible time. Multi-agent teams, which can include specialized human respondents, robots and canine units, complement the strengths and weaknesses of each agent, like all-terrain mobility or capability to locate human beings. However, efficient coordination of heterogeneous agents requires specific means to locate the agents, and to provide them with the information they require to complete their mission. The major contribution of this work is an application of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) to gather information from a multi-agent team and to make it available to the rest of the agents while keeping coverage. In particular, a canine agent has been equipped with a mobile node installed on a harness, providing information about the dog's location as well as gas levels. The configuration of the mobile node allows for flexible arrangement of the system, being able to integrate static as well as mobile nodes. The gathered information is available at an external database, so that the rest of the agents and the control center can use it in real time. The proposed scheme has been tested in realistic scenarios during search and rescue exercises.",

There are two key features that separate IRIS from most of the state-of-the-art multi-robot testbeds. (1)Portability: IRIS does not require a costly static global positioning system such as a VICON system nor time-intensive vision-based SLAM for its operation. Designed with an inexpensive Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA)localization system with centimeter level accuracy, the IRIS testbed can be deployed in an arbitrary uncontrolled environment in a matter of minutes. (2)Programmable Wireless Communication Stack: IRIS comes with a modular programmable low-power IEEE 802.15.4 radio and IPv6 network stack on each node. For the ease of administrative control and communication, we also developed a lightweight publish-subscribe overlay protocol called ROMANO that is used for bootstrapping the robots (also referred to as the IRISbots), collecting statistics, and direct control of individual robots, if needed. We detail the modular architecture of the IRIS testbed design along with the system implementation details and localization performance statistics.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Establishing a symbiotic relationship between a human and a exoskeleton is the end goal in many applications in order to provide benefits to the user. However, the literature focusing on the human side of human-exoskeleton interaction has remained less exhaustive than the literature focusing on the design (hardware/software) of the exoskeleton device itself. It is, though, essential to understand how a human adapts his motor control when interacting with an exoskeleton. Motor adaptation is an implicit process carried out by the central nervous system when the body encounters a perturbation, a paradigm that has been extensively studied in the field of human motor control research. When wearing an exoskeleton, even \u201cas-transparent-as-possible\u201d, contact/interaction forces may impact well-known motor control laws in a way that may be detrimental to the user, and even compromise usability in real applications. The present paper investigates how interaction with a backdrivable upper-limb exoskeleton (ABLE) set in \u201ctransparent\u201d mode of control affects the kinematics/dynamics of human movement in a simple task. We find that important motor control features are preserved when moving with ABLE but an overall movement slowness occurs, likely as a response to increased inertia according to optimal control simulations. Such a human motor control approach illustrates one possible way to assess the degree of symbiosis between human and exoskeleton, i.e. by grounding on well-known findings in motor control research.",

The proposed system makes use of a social robot behavioral architecture already developed in our lab, which allows us to interchange developments between our robotic realizations and the 3D avatar. The overall system is divided into two parts: back projection subsystem and expression generator subsystem. The back projection subsystem projects a three-dimensional avatar onto a pyramidal structure in order to achieve a sensation of depth and realism. The expression generator subsystem carries out the avatar animations using shape keys and bones, following the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). The system consists in several nodes that are integrated in ROS middleware (Robotic Operating System), and includes a user interface that makes the avatar teleoperation easier (the package is avaible in github public respository). In order to evaluate the expressiveness of the system, two sets of experiments have been performed: one to analyze the avatar's gestural ability, that is, its capability to perform expressions that can be identified by an observer, and a second experiment to measure the emotion displaying ability in terms of valence and arousal.",

        "abstract": "Planning for autonomous driving in complex, urban scenarios requires accurate prediction of the trajectories of surrounding traffic participants. Their future behavior depends on their route intentions, the road-geometry, traffic rules and mutual interaction, resulting in interdependencies between their trajectories. We present a probabilistic prediction framework based on a dynamic Bayesian network, which represents the state of the complete scene including all agents and respects the aforementioned dependencies. We propose Markovian, context-dependent motion models to define the interaction-aware behavior of drivers. At first, the state of the dynamic Bayesian network is estimated over time by tracking the single agents via sequential Monte Carlo inference. Secondly, we perform a probabilistic forward simulation of the network's estimated belief state to generate the different combinatorial scene developments. This provides the corresponding trajectories for the set of possible, future scenes. Our framework can handle various road layouts and number of traffic participants. We evaluate the approach in online simulations and real-world scenarios. It is shown that our interaction-aware prediction outperforms interaction-unaware physics- and map-based approaches.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we address the challenge of robotic manipulation of elastically deforming objects. To this end, we model elastic objects using the Finite Element Method. Through a quasi-static assumption, we leverage sensitivity analysis to mathematically model how changes in the robot's configuration affect the deformed shape of the object being manipulated. This enables an interactive, simulation-based control methodology, wherein user-specified deformations for the elastic objects are automatically mapped to joint angle commands. The optimization formulation we introduce is general, operates directly within a robot's workspace and can readily incorporate joint limits as well as collision avoidance between the links. We validate our control methodology on a YuMi\u00ae IRB 14000, which we use to manipulate a variety of elastic objects.",

        "abstract": "For many robotic tasks, particularly those of service robots operating in human environments, the scope of object detection needs is greater than the available data. Either public datasets do not contain the entire set of objects needed for the task, and/or it is a commercial application that cannot use public datasets for training. Instead of hiring people to hand-label more data to support the integration of new objects into robot perception, we propose an interactive training process requiring zero hand labeling. With as little as 4 minutes of interaction with the robot per object, we demonstrate 99% precision and 57% recall in stationary object detection tasks.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In recent years the topic of combining motion and symbolic planning to perform complex tasks in the field of robotics has received a lot of attention. The underlying idea is to have access at once to the reasoning capabilities of a task planner and to the ability of the motion planner to verify that the plan is feasible from a physical and geometrical point of view. The present work describes a framework to perform manipulation tasks that require the use of two robotic manipulators. To do so we employ a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planner interleaved with geometric constraint verification. In this framework we also consider observation actions and handle noisy perceptions from a probabilistic perspective. These ideas are put into practice by means of an experimental set-up in which two Barrett WAM robots have to cooperatively solve a geometric puzzle. Our findings provide further evidence that considering explicitly physical constraints during task planning, rather than deferring their validation to the moment of execution, is advantageous in terms of execution time and breadth of situations that can be handled.",

To achieve the goal, we propose a method for estimating the homologous posture of the mammalian skeletal system corresponding to the human body posture. We hypothesize the homology of bone geometry between mammalian species implies that of biomechanical functions. The method relies on this homology and determines the homologous postures according to the anatomical landmarks of bone geometry. This paper shows the results of the analysis on homologous postures between the human and mouse skeletal models to validate our hypothesis. A pilot study also introduces comparison of mechanical functions between the two models by using the homologous postures.",

        "abstract": "An interval-based approach to cooperative localization for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is proposed. It computes a pose uncertainty domain for each robot, i.e., a set that contains the true robot pose, assuming bounded error measurements. The algorithm combines distances measurements to the ground station and between UAVs, with the tracking of known landmarks in camera images, and provides a guaranteed enclosure of the robots pose domains. Pose uncertainty domains are computed using interval constraint propagation techniques, thanks to a branch and bound algorithm. We show that the proposed method also provides a good point estimate, that can be further refined using nonlinear iterative weighted least squares. Results are presented for simulated two-robots configurations, for experimental data, and compared with a classical Extended Kalman Filter.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning has been successful in a variety of applications that have high-dimensional state spaces such as object recognition, video games, and machine translation. Deep neural networks can automatically learn important features from high-dimensional state given large training datasets. However, the success of deep learning in robot systems in the realworld is limited due to the cost of obtaining these large datasets. To overcome this problem, we propose an information-theoretic, intrinsically motivated, self-labeling mechanism using closed-loop control states. Taking this approach biases exploration to informative interactions-as such, a robot requires much less training to achieve reliable performance. In this paper, we explore the impact such an approach has on learning how to grasp objects. We evaluate different intrinsic motivators present in the literature applied appropriately in our framework and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each.",

A standard endoscope is robotized and a gaze control system based on eye-tracking is developed and implemented, allowing hands-free manipulation. The system characteristics and step response has been evaluated using visual servoing. Further, the robotized system has been compared with a manually controlled endoscope during a user study. The users (n=11) showed a preference for the gaze controlled endoscope and a lower task load when the task was performed with the gaze control. In addition, gaze control was related to a higher success rate and a lower time to perform the task. The results presented validate the system's technical performance and demonstrate the intuitiveness of hands-free gaze control in flexible endoscopy.",

But owing to the specific properties of the considered class of problems, the involved linearizations are proved to have a form of independence with respect to the current estimates, leveraged to avoid (partially or sometimes totally) the need to relinearize. The method is validated on a robot localization example, both in simulations and on real experimental data.",

This paper proposes to generate camera trajectories, with position and time constraints, that result in higher reconstructed image quality. The degradation in of an image captured during motion is known as motion blur. Three main methods exist for mitigating the effects of motion blur: (i) controlling optical parameters, (ii) controlling camera motion, and (iii) image reconstruction. Given control of a camera's motion, trajectories can be generated that result in an expected blur kernel or point-spread function. This work compares the motion blur effects and reconstructed image quality of three trajectories: (i) linear, (ii) polynomial, and (iii) inverse error.

Observing an agent, human or robotic, perform a task provides information and facilitates learning the task. We show how the agent's preferences learned using IRL can be incorporated in a subject robot's decision making and planning, to enable the robot to spontaneously collaborate with the previously observed agent on the task. We prioritize a real-world application, where a line robot will autonomously collaborate with another robot in sorting ripe and unripe fruit such as oranges. Toward this, our evaluations utilize a colored-ball sorting task as an analog using simulated TurtleBots equipped with Phantom X arms. Our method is comprehensive providing first answers to questions such as how should the robot acquire the complete model for the collaborative planning problem and how should it solve the problem to obtain a plan that permits collaboration without disrupting the line robot's behavior.",

        "abstract": "Robotics and Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) are well-established technologies for the rehabilitation of stroke and spinal cord injured (SCI) patients. We propose a hybrid solution that combines feedback-controlled FES of biceps and triceps as well as posterior and anterior deltoid with a cable-driven robotic system to support repetitive arm movements, like \u201cbreaststroke swimming\u201d exercises. The robotic system partially compensates the arm weight by controlling the cable tension forces, and the FES promotes motion in the transversal plane. To adjust the FES support to the needs of the individual patients we use an iterative learning vector field (ILVF) which encodes the stimulation intensities that are applied to guide the patient along a pre-specified reference trajectory in the joint angle space. In contrast to previous iterative learning control approaches, the ILVF allows the patient to perform the motion at self-selected cadence. The proposed learning algorithm explicitly takes the dynamics of the artificially activated muscles into account and assures smooth stimulation intensity profiles. The control algorithm is tested in simulations using a complex neuro-musculoskeletal model. For \u201cbreaststroke\u201d motions, the initial RMS error of purely volitional movements is reduced from 38\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 within 21 cycles by the adaptive FES support. After 50 iterations of the ILVF, the algorithm converges to a steady state RMS error of 4\u00b0. Changes in the patient's muscle activity and cadence were well tolerated by the control system and did not cause a noticable increase in the steady state RMS error.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic walking robots have the potential for efficient and lifelike locomotion, but computing efficient gaits and tracking them is difficult in the presence of under-modeling. Iterative Learning Control (ILC) is a method to learn the control signal to track a periodic reference over several attempts, augmenting a model with online data. Terminal ILC (TILC), a variant of ILC, allows other performance objectives to be addressed at the cost of ignoring parts of the reference. However, dynamic walking robot gaits are not necessarily periodic in time. In this paper, we adapt TILC to jointly optimize final foot placement and energy efficiency on dynamic walking robots by indexing by a phase variable instead of time, yielding \u201cphase-indexed TILC\u201d (\u03b8 - TILC). When implemented on a five-link walker in simulation, \u03b8- TILC learns a more energy-efficient walking motion compared to traditional time-indexed TILC.",

State-of-the-art robotic grasping methods perform prediction of object grasp locations based on deep neural networks. However, such networks require huge amount of labeled data for training making this approach often impracticable in robotics. In this paper, we propose a method to generate a large scale synthetic dataset with ground truth, which we refer to as the Jacquard grasping dataset. Jacquard is built on a subset of ShapeNet, a large CAD models dataset, and contains both RGB-D images and annotations of successful grasping positions based on grasp attempts performed in a simulated environment. We carried out experiments using an off-the-shelf CNN, with three different evaluation metrics, including real grasping robot trials. The results show that Jacquard enables much better generalization skills than a human labeled dataset thanks to its diversity of objects and grasping positions. For the purpose of reproducible research in robotics, we are releasing along with the Jacquard dataset a web interface for researchers to evaluate the successfulness of their grasping position detections using our dataset.",

Using these proposals, the second stage detection network performs accurate oriented 3D bounding box regression and category classification to predict the extents, orientation, and classification of objects in 3D space.

        "abstract": "Pose estimation and mapping are key capabilities of most autonomous vehicles and thus a number of localization and SLAM algorithms have been developed in the past. Autonomous robots and cars are typically equipped with multiple sensors. Often, the sensor suite includes a camera and a laser range finder. In this paper, we consider the problem of incremental ego-motion estimation, using both, a monocular camera and a laser range finder jointly. We propose a new algorithm, that exploits the advantages of both sensors-the ability of cameras to determine orientations well and the ability of laser range finders to estimate the scale and to directly obtain 3D point clouds. Our approach estimates the 5 degrees of freedom relative orientation from image pairs through feature point correspondences and formulates the remaining scale estimation as a new variant of the iterative closest point problem with only one degree of freedom. We furthermore exploit the camera information in a new way to constrain the data association between laser point clouds. The experiments presented in this paper suggest that our approach is able to accurately estimate the ego-motion of a vehicle and that we obtain more accurate frame-to-frame alignments than with one sensor modality alone.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a method of structure inspection using mixed-reality headsets to reduce the human effort in reporting accurate inspection information such as fault locations in 3D coordinates. Prior to every inspection, the headset needs to be localized. While external pose estimation and fiducial marker based localization would require setup, maintenance, and manual calibration; marker-free self-localization can be achieved using the onboard depth sensor and camera. However, due to limited depth sensor range of portable mixed-reality headsets like Microsoft HoloLens, localization based on simple point cloud registration (sPCR) would require extensive mapping of the environment. Also, localization based on camera image would face same issues as stereo ambiguities and hence depends on viewpoint. We thus introduce a novel approach to Joint Point Cloud and Image-based Localization (JPIL) for mixed-reality headsets that uses visual cues and headset orientation to register small, partially overlapped point clouds and save significant manual labor and time in environment mapping. Our empirical results compared to sPCR show average 10 fold reduction of required overlap surface area that could potentially save on average 20 minutes per inspection. JPIL is not only restricted to inspection tasks but also can be essential in enabling intuitive human-robot interaction for spatial mapping and scene understanding in conjunction with other agents like autonomous robotic systems that are increasingly being deployed in outdoor environments for applications like structural inspection.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Applying agrochemicals is the default procedure for conventional weed control in crop production, but has negative impacts on the environment. Robots have the potential to treat every plant in the field individually and thus can reduce the required use of such chemicals. To achieve that, robots need the ability to identify crops and weeds in the field and must additionally select effective treatments. While certain types of weed can be treated mechanically, other types need to be treated by (selective) spraying. In this paper, we present an approach that provides the necessary information for effective plant-specific treatment. It outputs the stem location for weeds, which allows for mechanical treatments, and the covered area of the weed for selective spraying. Our approach uses an end-to-end trainable fully convolutional network that simultaneously estimates stem positions as well as the covered area of crops and weeds. It jointly learns the class-wise stem detection and the pixel-wise semantic segmentation. Experimental evaluations on different real-world datasets show that our approach is able to reliably solve this problem. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our approach not only substantially improves the stem detection accuracy, i.e., distinguishing crop and weed stems, but also provides an improvement in the semantic segmentation performance.",

In this study, we aimed to realize a jumping motion that accumulates energy more appropriately in spring by combining active joint driving with spring behavior like human tendons and muscles. We proposed a countermovement jump method using the resonance with the leg's active pushing-off movement and leg stiffness. To achieve active pushing-off and joint stiffness, we developed a new joint mechanism using leaf springs and an actuator unit with a worm gear. We then performed experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism and methods. Finally, the robot achieved a countermovement jump using active kicking and leg's elasticity.",

        "abstract": "Emergency trajectories enable one to move faster through an environment while still moving safely. Having an emergency trajectory within an observed vacant space makes it possible to safely navigate through unknown territory or through a door without slowing down. Emergency trajectories allow for safe navigation of a vehicle into a safe system state, e.g. a stop, in the event of recognition of an obstacle. This work formally proves the benefit of using emergency trajectories to generate safe and faster motion controls as compared to vehicle operation without such trajectories. Furthermore, this work also presents a working integration of this formalism into a vehicle's low level control system in a Moving Horizon Trajectory Planner (MHTP) with an update rate of 10Hz. Using an MHTP along with a dynamic model of the environment and the proposed constraints, the system is able to derive emergency trajectory candidates which fulfill our safety requirements. This distinguishes the approach from that of others, which replans discrete paths that are then followed by the vehicle's local control system. This approach was implemented on a differential-drive mobile agent and tested using non-static environment assumptions. Simulated and real-robot experimental results illustrate the quality of our approach.",

        "abstract": "External force observer for humanoid robots has been widely studied in the literature. However, most of the proposed approaches generally rely on information from six-axis force/torque sensors, which the small or medium-sized humanoid robots usually do not have. As a result, those approaches cannot be applied to this category of humanoid robots, which is widely used nowadays in education or research. In this paper, we improve the external force observer in [1] to handle the case of an external force applied in any direction and at an arbitrary point of the robot structure. The new observer is based on Kalman filter formulation and it allows the estimation of the three force components. The observer is simple to implement and can easily run in real time using the embedded processor of a medium-sized humanoid robot such as Nao or Darwin-OP. Moreover, the observer does not require any change to the robot hardware as it only uses measurements from the available force-sensing resistors (FSR) inserted under the feet of the humanoid robot and from the robot inertial measurement unit (IMU). The proposed observer was extensively validated on a Nao humanoid robot. In all conducted experiments, the observer successfully estimated the external force within a reasonable margin of error.",

        "abstract": "Learning motion primitives from demonstration requires the human demonstrator to effectively relay the task intent to the robot controller. When the task intent is not reflected sufficiently by the demonstration, multiple iterations are required to recover the underlying intent of the demonstrations. However, a large number of iterations can be expensive and might not be practical for each new task. A challenge is that human-in-the-loop demonstrations can be affected by the human motor dynamics (e.g., from visual observation to hand motion), which can lead to differences between the demonstration and intent. The main contribution of this article is to correct for the human motor dynamics and infer the intended action (motion primitive) from the human demonstrations. The proposed approach uses a kernel-based regression approach to learn the inverse human-dynamics response. These models are then used to correct for human-motor-dynamics and infer the intent of the human-in-the-loop demonstrator. Experimental validation is performed with an assisted teleoperation setup where the underlying intent is specified using an augmented reality display. Results indicate that the proposed approach leads to more precise intent estimation as compared to the actual human demonstrations.",

        "abstract": "Many of today's Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO)frameworks work well under regular motion but have issues and need special treatment under special motion. Here, special does not imply bad or corrupted data but stands for increased difficulty to treat clean data. Common special motion for VIO are large feature displacement due to fast motion close to a scene and zero motion phases not providing sufficient baseline. In this paper we present a feature and frame selection approach which seamlessly handles all motion scenarios without the need of (error prone)motion case identification and subsequent case-specific heuristics. We further show that this approach allows to eliminate features in the state vector (persistent features)altogether while still being able to inherently handle zero motion phases. This reduces computational complexity while maintaining the ability to hover in place. We integrate our frame selection approach into our own VIO algorithm and compare its performance against three state-of-the-art algorithms with real data on a real platform. While our approach shows slightly higher global drift it is the only algorithm that can reliably estimate the pose over a large motion spectrum from fast scale change down to zero motion.",

Compared to traditional key-frame selection algorithms, this work makes use of the temporal and spatial relationship among objects on the pre-defined field to compute the information entropy. The selection ratio can be adjusted by two parameters: entropy threshold and the maximum moving distance. The experimental results show that the developed method can effectively detect the change of scene using selected key-frames.

        "abstract": "Finding the parameters of a vignetting function for a camera currently involves the acquisition of several images in a given scene under very controlled lighting conditions, a cumbersome and error-prone task where the end result can only be confirmed visually. Many computer vision algorithms assume photoconsistency, constant intensity between scene points in different images, and tend to perform poorly if this assumption is violated. We present a real-time online vignetting and response calibration with additional exposure estimation for global-shutter color cameras. Our method does not require uniformly illuminated surfaces, known texture or specific geometry. The only assumptions are that the camera is moving, the illumination is static and reflections are Lambertian. Our method estimates the camera view poses by sparse visual SLAM and models the vignetting function by a small number of thin plate splines (TPS) together with a sixth-order polynomial to provide a dense estimation of attenuation from sparsely sampled scene points. The camera response function (CRF) is jointly modeled by a TPS and a Gamma curve. We evaluate our approach on synthetic datasets and in real-world scenarios with reference data from a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) system. We show clear visual improvement on textured meshes without the need for extensive meshing algorithms. A useful calibration is obtained from a few keyframes which makes an on-the-fly deployment conceivable.",

        "abstract": "The transfer of a robot skill between different geometric environments is non-trivial since a wide variety of environments exists, sensor observations as well as robot motions are high-dimensional, and the environment might only be partially observed. We consider the problem of extracting a low-dimensional description of the manipulated environment in form of a kinematic model. This allows us to transfer a skill by defining a policy on a prototype model and morphing the observed environment to this prototype. A deep neural network is used to map depth image observations of the environment to morphing parameter, which include transformations and configurations of the prototype model. Using the concatenation property of affine transformations and the ability to convert point clouds to depth images allows to apply the network in an iterative manner. The network is trained on data generated in a simulator and on augmented data that is created with its own predictions. The algorithm is evaluated on different tasks, where it is shown that iterative predictions lead to a higher accuracy than one-step predictions.",

        "abstract": "As personal autonomous mobility is getting to be more widely adopted, it is more important to consider comfortability of stuffs and persons carried by such mobility. In this work, we define the comfort of a trajectory as forces, specifically, translational force, received to objects carried by a robot while following the trajectory by measuring impulse. To maximize such a comfort, we propose a novel, kinodynamic comfort path planning method based on our definition of comfort. Our work is based on direct collocation method for handling our nonconvex objective function. We also introduce Bidirectional Obstacle Detection(BOD)that identifies the distances along the perpendicular directions to the trajectory. This is mainly designed for avoiding obstacles while minimizing forces causing discomfort. Our experimental results show that our method can compute trajectories whose comfort measures can be up to 18 times higher than those computed by prior related objectives, e.g., squared velocity used for generating smooth trajectory.",

        "abstract": "Technological developments call for increasing perception and action capabilities of robots. Among other skills, vision systems that can adapt to any possible change in the working conditions are needed. Since these conditions are unpredictable, we need benchmarks which allow to assess the generalization and robustness capabilities of our visual recognition algorithms. In this work we focus on robotic kitting in unconstrained scenarios. As a first contribution, we present a new visual dataset for the kitting task. Differently from standard object recognition datasets, we provide images of the same objects acquired under various conditions where camera, illumination and background are changed. This novel dataset allows for testing the robustness of robot visual recognition algorithms to a series of different domain shifts both in isolation and unified. Our second contribution is a novel online adaptation algorithm for deep models, based on batch-normalization layers, which allows to continuously adapt a model to the current working conditions. Differently from standard domain adaptation algorithms, it does not require any image from the target domain at training time. We benchmark the performance of the algorithm on the proposed dataset, showing its capability to fill the gap between the performances of a standard architecture and its counterpart adapted offline to the given target domain.",

This abstract view does not suffice for the decision making capabilities required by robotic agents that are to accomplish manipulation tasks. Such robots have to reason about how to pour without spilling, where to grasp a pot, how to open different containers, and so on. To enable such reasoning it is necessary to consider how objects are perceived, how motions can be executed and parameterized, and how motion parameterization affects the physical effects of actions. To this end, we propose to complement and extend symbolic reasoning methods with KnowRobSIM, an additional reasoning infrastructure based on modern game engine technology, including the subsymbolic world modeling through data structures, action simulation based on physics engine, and world scene rendering. We demonstrate how KnowRobSIM can perform powerful reasoning, prediction, and learning tasks that are required for informed decision making in object manipulation.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present an extension of Direct Sparse Odometry (DSO) [1] to a monocular visual SLAM system with loop closure detection and pose-graph optimization (LDSO). As a direct technique, DSO can utilize any image pixel with sufficient intensity gradient, which makes it robust even in featureless areas. LDSO retains this robustness, while at the same time ensuring repeatability of some of these points by favoring corner features in the tracking frontend. This repeatability allows to reliably detect loop closure candidates with a conventional feature-based bag-of-words (BoW) approach. Loop closure candidates are verified geometrically and Sim(3) relative pose constraints are estimated by jointly minimizing 2D and 3D geometric error terms. These constraints are fused with a co-visibility graph of relative poses extracted from DSO's sliding window optimization. Our evaluation on publicly available datasets demonstrates that the modified point selection strategy retains the tracking accuracy and robustness, and the integrated pose-graph optimization significantly reduces the accumulated rotation-, translation- and scale-drift, resulting in an overall performance comparable to state-of-the-art feature-based systems, even without global bundle adjustment.",

        "abstract": "The growing popularity of autonomous systems creates a need for reliable and efficient metric pose retrieval algorithms. Currently used approaches tend to rely on nearest neighbor search of binary descriptors to perform the 2D-3D matching and guarantee realtime capabilities on mobile platforms. These methods struggle, however, with the growing size of the map, changes in viewpoint or appearance, and visual aliasing present in the environment. The rigidly defined descriptor patterns only capture a limited neighborhood of the keypoint and completely ignore the overall visual context. We propose LandmarkBoost - an approach that, in contrast to the conventional 2D-3D matching methods, casts the search problem as a landmark classification task. We use a boosted classifier to classify landmark observations and directly obtain correspondences as classifier scores. We also introduce a formulation of visual context that is flexible, efficient to compute, and can capture relationships in the entire image plane. The original binary descriptors are augmented with contextual information and informative features are selected by the boosting framework. Through detailed experiments, we evaluate the retrieval quality and performance of Landmark-Boost, demonstrating that it outperforms common state-of-the-art descriptor matching methods.",

        "abstract": "Measuring the quality of roads and ensuring they are ready for autonomous driving is important for future transportation systems. Here we focus on developing metrics and algorithms to assess lane marking (LM)qualities from an egocentric view of an inspection vehicle equipped with a global positioning system (GPS)receiver, a frontal-view camera, and a light detection and ranging (LIDAR)system. We propose three quality metrics for LMs: correctness, shape, and visibility. The correctness metric measures the divergence between the expected LMs based on prior map inputs and the actual sensor inputs. The shape metric evaluates smoothness in road curvature and width range. The visibility metric evaluates the contrast between LMs and background road surfaces. We propose a dual-modal algorithm to compute these metrics. We have implemented the algorithms and tested them under KITTI dataset. The results show that our metrics can successfully detect LM anomalies in all testing scenarios.",

In this paper we propose a novel visual inertial localization framework that localizes against the LiDAR-built map. Based on the geometry information of the laser map, a hybrid bundle adjustment framework is proposed, which estimates the poses of the cameras with respect to the prior laser map as well as optimizes the state variables of the online visual inertial odometry system simultaneously. For more accurate crossmodal data association, the laser map is optimized using multisession laser and visual data to extract the salient and stable subset for visual localization. To validate the efficiency of the proposed method, we collect data in south part of our campus in different seasons, along the same and opposite-direction route. In all sessions of localization data, our proposed method gives satisfactory results, and shows the superiority of the hybrid bundle adjustment and map optimization1.",

Traditional motion planning algorithms rely on precise maps of the environment, where re-adapting a generated path can be highly demanding in terms of computational cost. In this paper, we present a fast reactive navigation algorithm using Deep Reinforcement Learning applied to multi rotor aerial robots. Taking as input the 2D-laser range measurements and the relative position of the aerial robot with respect to the desired goal, the proposed algorithm is successfully trained in a Gazebo-based simulation scenario by adopting an artificial potential field formulation. A thorough evaluation of the trained agent has been carried out both in simulated and real indoor scenarios, showing the appropriate reactive navigation behavior of the agent in the presence of static and dynamic obstacles.",

LeGO-LOAM is lightweight, as it can achieve realtime pose estimation on a low-power embedded system. LeGO-LOAM is ground-optimized, as it leverages the presence of a ground plane in its segmentation and optimization steps. We first apply point cloud segmentation to filter out noise, and feature extraction to obtain distinctive planar and edge features. A two-step Levenberg-Marquardt optimization method then uses the planar and edge features to solve different components of the six degree-of-freedom transformation across consecutive scans. We compare the performance of LeGO-LOAM with a state-of-the-art method, LOAM, using datasets gathered from variable-terrain environments with ground vehicles, and show that LeGO-LOAM achieves similar or better accuracy with reduced computational expense. We also integrate LeGO-LOAM into a SLAM framework to eliminate the pose estimation error caused by drift, which is tested using the KITTI dataset.",

        "abstract": "Hand gestures are a natural component of human-human communication. Simple hand gestures are intuitive and can exhibit great lexical variety. It stands to reason that such a user input mechanism can have many benefits, including seamless interaction, intuitive control and robustness to physical constraints and ambient electrical, light and sound interference. However, while semantic and logical information encoded via hand gestures is readily decoded by humans, leveraging this communication channel in human-machine interfaces remains a challenge. Recent data-driven deep learning approaches are promising towards uncovering abstract and complex relationships that manual and direct rule-based classification schemes fail to discover. Such an approach is amenable towards hand gesture recognition, but requires myriad data which can be collected physically via user experiments. This process, however, is onerous and tedious. A streamlined approach with less overhead is sought. To that end, this work presents a novel method of synthetic hand gesture dataset generation that leverages modern gaming engines. Furthermore, preliminary results indicate that the dataset, despite being synthetic and requiring no physical data collection, is both accurate and rich enough to train a real-world hand gesture classifier that operates in real-time.",

We show that by doing so, we are now able to encode both position and velocity attributes significantly more accurately. We test the usefulness of this self-supervised approach in a reinforcement learning setting. We show that the representations learned by agents observing themselves take random actions, or other agents perform tasks successfully, can enable the learning of continuous control policies using algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) using only the learned embeddings as input. We also demonstrate significant improvements on the real-world Pouring dataset with a relative error reduction of 39.4% for motion attributes and 11.1% for static attributes compared to the single-frame baseline.

Compared to passive human models, active human models capable of reproducing the decision-making, as well as vehicle maneuver motion planning and control, will be able to support realistic simulation of human-vehicle interaction. In this paper, we propose an integrated human-vehicle interaction simulation framework which learns vehicle maneuver motion primitives from human drivers, and uses them to compose natural and contextual driving motions. Specifically, we recruited six experienced drivers and recorded their vehicle maneuver motions on a fixed-base driving simulation testbed. We further segmented and classified the collected data based on their similarity in joint coordination. Using a combination of imitation learning methods, we extracted the regularity and variability of vehicle maneuver motions across subjects, and learned the dynamic motion primitives to be used for motion reproduction in simulation. We present an implementation of the framework on lower-extremity joint coordination in pedal activation for longitudinal vehicle control. Our research efforts lead to a motion primitive library which enables planning natural driver motions, and will be integrated with the driving decision-making, motion control, and vehicle dynamics in the proposed framework for simulating human-vehicle interaction.",

        "abstract": "When learning forward and inverse kinematics maps of manipulators, usually little attention is paid to data-efficiency, i.e., the accuracy gained per action-outcome sample. This paper examines properties of popular (online) learning techniques and demonstrates that - regardless of the employed exploration strategy - the structure of kinematics mappings does not allow for a practically viable trade-off between the number of samples and the resulting approximation error for manipulators with more than a few DoFs - unless tailored parametric models are employed. We discuss suitable choices for these parametric models for both rigid and elastic discretely-actuated robots and compare their data -efficiency to that of popular exploratory learning approaches relying on non-parametric models. Our theoretical considerations are confirmed by various experimental results for inverse kinematics mappings of rigid and omnielastic manipulators.",

        "abstract": "Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a popular approach to endowing robots with skills without having to program them by hand. Typically, LfD relies on human demonstrations in clutter-free environments. This prevents the demonstrations from being affected by irrelevant objects, whose influence can obfuscate the true intention of the human or the constraints of the desired skill. However, it is unrealistic to assume that the robot's environment can always be restructured to remove clutter when capturing human demonstrations. To contend with this problem, we develop an importance weighted batch and incremental skill learning approach, building on a recent inference-based technique for skill representation and reproduction. Our approach reduces unwanted environmental influences on the learned skill, while still capturing the salient human behavior. We provide both batch and incremental versions of our approach and validate our algorithms on a 7-DOF JACO2 manipulator with reaching and placing skills.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The hardware compatibility of legged locomotion is often illustrated by Zero Moment Point (ZMP) that has been extensively studied for decades. One of the most popular models for computing the ZMP is the linear inverted pendulum (LIP) model that expresses ZMP as a linear function of the center of mass(COM) and its acceleration. In the real world, however, it may not accurately predict the true ZMP of hardware due to various reasons such as unmodeled dynamics and differences between simulation model and hardware. In this paper, we aim to improve the theoretical ZMP model by learning the real hardware dynamics from experimental data. We first optimize the motion plan using the theoretical ZMP model and collect COP data by executing the motion on a force plate. We then train a new ZMP model that maps the motion plan variable to the actual ZMP and use the learned model for finding a new hardware-compatible motion plan. Through various locomotion tasks of a quadruped, we demonstrate that motions planned for the learned ZMP model are compatible on hardware when those for the theoretical ZMP model are not. Furthermore, experiments using ZMP models with different complexities reveal that overly complex models may suffer from over-fitting even though they can potentially represent more complex, unmodeled dynamics.",

        "abstract": "Humans and mobile robots will be increasingly cohabiting in the same environments, which has lead to an increase in studies on human robot interaction (HRI). One important topic in these studies is the development of robot navigation algorithms that are socially compliant to humans navigating in the same space. In this paper, we present a method to learn human navigation behaviors using maximum entropy deep inverse reinforcement learning (MEDIRL). We use a large open dataset of pedestrian trajectories collected in an uncontrolled environment as the expert demonstrations. Human navigation behaviors are captured by a nonlinear reward function through deep neural network (DNN) approximation. The developed MEDIRL algorithm takes feature inputs including social affinity map (SAM) that are extracted from human motion trajectories. We perform simulation experiments using the learned reward function, and the performance is evaluated comparing it with the real measured pedestrian trajectories in the dataset. The evaluation results show that the proposed method has acceptable prediction accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods, and it can generate pedestrian trajectories similar to real human trajectories with natural social navigation behaviors such as collision avoidance, leader-follower, and split-and-rejoin.",

        "abstract": "Millirobots are a promising robotic platform for many applications due to their small size and low manufacturing costs. Legged millirobots, in particular, can provide increased mobility in complex environments and improved scaling of obstacles. However, controlling these small, highly dynamic, and underactuated legged systems is difficult. Hand-engineered controllers can sometimes control these legged millirobots, but they have difficulties with dynamic maneuvers and complex terrains. We present an approach for controlling a real-world legged millirobot that is based on learned neural network models. Using less than 17 minutes of data, our method can learn a predictive model of the robot's dynamics that can enable effective gaits to be synthesized on the fly for following user-specified waypoints on a given terrain. Furthermore, by leveraging expressive, high-capacity neural network models, our approach allows for these predictions to be directly conditioned on camera images, endowing the robot with the ability to predict how different terrains might affect its dynamics. This enables sample-efficient and effective learning for locomotion of a dynamic legged millirobot on various terrains, including gravel, turf, carpet, and styrofoam.

        "abstract": "Sampling-based motion planners have experienced much success due to their ability to efficiently and evenly explore the state space. However, for many tasks, it may be more efficient to not uniformly explore the state space, especially when there is prior information about its structure. Previous methods have attempted to modify the sampling distribution using hand selected heuristics that can work well for specific environments but not universally. In this paper, a policy-search based method is presented as an adaptive way to learn implicit sampling distributions for different environments. It utilizes information from past searches in similar environments to generate better distributions in novel environments, thus reducing overall computational cost. Our method can be incorporated with a variety of sampling-based planners to improve performance. Our approach is validated on a number of tasks, including a 7DOF robot arm, showing marked improvement in number of collision checks as well as number of nodes expanded compared with baseline methods.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a fully deep learning approach to monocular SLAM, which can perform simultaneous localization using a neural network for learning visual odometry (L-VO) and dense 3D mapping. Dense 2D flow and a depth image are generated from monocular images by sub-networks, which are then used by a 3D flow associated layer in the L-VO network to generate dense 3D flow. Given this 3D flow, the dual-stream L-VO network can then predict the 6DOF relative pose and furthermore reconstruct the vehicle trajectory. In order to learn the correlation between motion directions, the Bivariate Gaussian modeling is employed in the loss function. The L-VO network achieves an overall performance of 2.68 % for average translational error and 0.0143\u00b0/m for average rotational error on the KITTI odometry benchmark. Moreover, the learned depth is leveraged to generate a dense 3D map. As a result, an entire visual SLAM system, that is, learning monocular odometry combined with dense 3D mapping, is achieved.",

A reinforcement learning technique, i.e., PEPG, is employed to embed appropriate mechanosensor feedback to harness global entrainment among the controller, the body dynamics, and the environment without explicitly designing the interaction between the oscillators. Another reinforcement learning, actor-critic, was applied to train the controller for the simulation models to analyze the effectiveness of PEPG in the system. Furthermore, the gait controller was trained under different body dynamics, i.e., the physical model of a caterpillar and an earthworm. We found that PEPG is suitable for the system probably because it does not add exploration noise to actions and it conducts episode based parameter updates. The simulation results show the proposed method can acquire distinct behavior, i.e., caterpillars' crawling, inching and earthworms' crawling, under different body dynamics. The outcome implies, that by utilizing appropriate learning method, desired functionality can be achieved in soft-bodied robots without explicitly designing their behavior.",

        "abstract": "Given the description of an object, s physical attributes, humans can determine a proper strategy and grasp an object. This paper proposes an approach to determine grasping strategy for an anthropomorphic robotic hand simply based on natural-language descriptions of an object. A learning-based approach is proposed to help a robotic hand learn suitable grasp poses starting from the natural language description of the object. Object features are parsed from natural-language descriptions by using a customized natural-language processing technique. The most likely grasp type for the given object is learned from the human grasping taxonomy based on the parsed features. The grasping strategy generated by the proposed approach is evaluated both by simulation study and execution of the grasps on an AR10 robotic hand.",

The dependency on the global information is eliminated by providing only sparse range-finder measurements to the robot. The partially observable planning problem is addressed by splitting it into a hierarchical process. We use convolutional networks to plan locally, and a differentiable memory to provide information about past time steps in the trajectory. These modules, combined in our network architecture, produce globally consistent plans. The sparse reward problem is mitigated by our modified policy gradient algorithm. We model the robots uncertainty with unsupervised tasks to force exploration. The novel architecture we propose with the modified version of the policy gradient algorithm allows our robot to reach the goal in a sample efficient manner, which is orders of magnitude faster than the current state of the art policy gradient algorithm. Simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "A critical capability required for generally intelligent robot behavior is the ability to sequence motor skills to reach a goal. This requires a (typically abstract) representation that supports goal-directed planning, which raises the question of how to construct such a representation. Previous work has addressed this question in the context of simple black-box motor skills, which are insufficiently flexible to support the wide range of behavior required of intelligent robots. We now extend that work to include parametrized motor skills, where a robot must both select an action to execute and also decide how to parametrize it. We show how to construct a representation suitable for planning with parametrized motor skills, and specify conditions which are sufficient to separate the selection of motor skills from the parametrization of those skills. Our method results in a simple discrete abstract representation for planning followed by a parameter selection process that operates on a fixed plan. We first demonstrate learning this representation in a virtual domain based on Angry Birds and then learn an abstract symbolic representation for a robot manipulation task.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Skilled robotic manipulation benefits from complex synergies between non-prehensile (e.g. pushing) and prehensile (e.g. grasping) actions: pushing can help rearrange cluttered objects to make space for arms and fingers; likewise, grasping can help displace objects to make pushing movements more precise and collision-free. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to discover and learn these synergies from scratch through model-free deep reinforcement learning. Our method involves training two fully convolutional networks that map from visual observations to actions: one infers the utility of pushes for a dense pixel-wise sampling of end-effector orientations and locations, while the other does the same for grasping. Both networks are trained jointly in a Q-learning framework and are entirely self-supervised by trial and error, where rewards are provided from successful grasps. In this way, our policy learns pushing motions that enable future grasps, while learning grasps that can leverage past pushes. During picking experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we find that our system quickly learns complex behaviors even amid challenging cases of tightly packed clutter, and achieves better grasping success rates and picking efficiencies than baseline alternatives after a few hours of training. We further demonstrate that our method is capable of generalizing to novel objects.

This paper introduces a trajectory optimization approach that achieves realtime performance by combining machine learning to predict optimal trajectories with refinement by quadratic optimization. First, a library of optimal trajectories is calculated offline and used to train a neural network. Online, the neural network predicts a trajectory for a novel initial state and cost function, and this prediction is further optimized by a sparse quadratic programming solver. We apply this approach to a fly-to-target movement problem for an indoor quadrotor. Experiments demonstrate that the technique calculates near-optimal trajectories in a few milliseconds, and generates agile movement that can be tracked more accurately than existing methods.",

Traditionally, handcrafted feature descriptors were used for these problems but recently learned descriptors have been shown to perform more robustly. In this work, we propose a local feature descriptor for 3D LiDAR scans. The descriptor is learned using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our proposed architecture consists of a Siamese network for learning a feature descriptor and a metric learning network for matching the descriptors. We also present a method for estimating local surface patches and obtaining ground-truth correspondences.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to learn and generalize robotic skills from a demonstration using deep reinforcement learning (deep RL). Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) formulate a nonlinear differential equation and produce the observed movement from a demonstration. However, it is hard to generate new behaviors from using DMPs. Thus, we apply DMPs framework into deep RL as an initial setting for learning the robotic skills. First, we build a network to represent this differential equation, and learn and generalize the movements by optimizing the shape of DMPs with respect to the rewards up to the end of each sequence of movement primitives. In order to do this, we consider a deterministic actor-critic algorithm for deep RL and we also apply a hierarchical strategy. This drastically reduces the search space for a robot by decomposing the task, which allows to solve the sparse reward problem from a complex task. In order to integrate DMPs with hierarchical deep RL, the differential equation is considered as temporal abstraction of option. The overall structure is mainly composed of two controllers: meta-controller and sub-controller. The meta-controller learns a policy over intrinsic goals and a sub-controller learns a policy over actions to accomplish the given goals. We demonstrate our approach on a 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) arm with a I-DOF gripper and evaluate our approach through a pick-and-place task.",

For robots to act autonomously in a real environment, it is necessary to define the appropriate actions for the environment. However, it is difficult to define these actions manually. Therefore, body motions that are common to multiple actions are defined as motion primitives. Complex actions can then be learned by combining these motion primitives. For learning motion primitives, we propose a reference-point and object-dependent Gaussian process hidden semi-Markov model (RPOD-GP-HSMM). For verification, a robot is teleoperated to perform the actions included in several domestic household chores. The robot then learns the associated motion primitives from the robot's body information and object information.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents, for the first time, a method for learning in-contact tasks from a teleoperated demonstration with a hydraulic manipulator. Due to the use of extremely powerful hydraulic manipulator, a force-reflected bilateral teleoperation is the most reasonable method of giving a human demonstration. An advanced subsystem-dynamic-based control design framework, virtual decomposition control (VDC), is used to design a stability-guaranteed controller for the teleoperation system, while taking into account the full nonlinear dynamics of the master and slave manipulators. The use of fragile force/torque sensor at the tip of the hydraulic slave manipulator is avoided by estimating the contact forces from the manipulator actuators' chamber pressures. In the proposed learning method, it is observed that a surface-sliding tool has a friction-dependent range of directions (between the actual direction of motion and the contact force) from which the manipulator can apply force to produce the sliding motion. By this intuition, an intersection of these ranges can be taken over a motion to robustly find a desired direction for the motion from one or more demonstrations. The compliant axes required to reproduce the motion can be found by assuming that all motions outside the desired direction is caused by the environment, signalling the need for compliance. Finally, the learning method is incorporated to a novel VDC-based impedance control method to learn compliant behaviour from teleoperated human demonstrations. Experiments with 2-DOF hydraulic manipulator with a 475kg payload demonstrate the suitability and effectiveness of the proposed method to perform learning from demonstration (LfD) with heavy-duty hydraulic manipulators.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Recent physics-based models of concentric tube continuum robots are able to describe pose of the tip, given the preformed translation and rotation in joint space of the robot. However, such model-based approaches are associated with high computational load and highly non-linear modeling effort. A data-driven approach for computationally fast estimation of the kinematics without requiring the knowledge and the uncertainties in the physics-based model would be an asset. This paper introduces an approach to solve the forward kinematics as well as the inverse kinematics of concentric tube continuum robots with 6-DOF in three dimensional space SE(3). Two artificial neural networks with ReLU (rectified linear unit) activation functions are designed in order to approximate the respective kinematics. Measured data from a robot prototype are used in order to train, validate, and test the proposed approach. We introduce a representation of the rotatory joints by trigonometric functions that improves the accuracy of the approximation. The results with experimental measurements show higher accuracy for the forward kinematics compared to the state of the art mechanics modeling. The tip error is less then 2.3 mm w.r.t. position (1 % of total robot length) and 1.1\u00b0 w.r.t. orientation. The single artificial neural network for the inverse kinematics approximation achieves a translation and rotation actuator error of 4.0 mm and 8.3 0, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)are becoming increasingly popular facilitated by their extensive availability. Autonomous navigation methods can act as an enabler for the safe deployment of drones on a wide range of real-world civilian applications. In this work, we introduce a self-supervised CNN-based approach for indoor robot navigation. Our method addresses the problem of real-time obstacle avoidance, by employing a regression CNN that predicts the agent's distance-to-collision in view of the raw visual input of its on-board monocular camera. The proposed CNN is trained on our custom indoor-flight dataset which is collected and annotated with real-distance labels, in a self-supervised manner using external sensors mounted on an UAV. By simultaneously processing the current and previous input frame, the proposed CNN extracts spatio-temporal features that encapsulate both static appearance and motion information to estimate the robot's distance to its closest obstacle towards multiple directions. These predictions are used to modulate the yaw and linear velocity of the UAV, in order to navigate autonomously and avoid collisions. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach learns a navigation policy that achieves high accuracy on real-world indoor flights, outperforming previously proposed methods from the literature.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We present a robot model of early reach and grasp learning, inspired by infant learning without prior knowledge of the geometry, kinematics, or dynamics of the arm. Human infants at reach onset are capable of using a sequence of jerky submotions to bring the hand to the position of a nearby object. A robotic learning agent can produce qualitatively similar behavior by using a graph representation to encode a set of safe, potentially useful arm states and feasible moves between them. These observations show that the Peri-Personal Space (PPS) Graph model is sufficient for early reaching and suggest that infants may use analogous models during this phase. In this paper, we show that the PPS Graph, with a simulated Palmar reflex (a reflex in infants that closes the fingers when the palm is touched), allows accidental grasps to occur during continued reaching practice. Given these occasional events, the agent can bootstrap to a simple deliberate grasp action. In particular, the agent must learn three new necessary conditions for a grasp: the hand should be open as the grasp begins, the final motion of the hand should be led by the gripper opening so that it reaches the target first, and the wrist must be oriented such that the gripper fingers may close around the target object, often requiring the opening to be perpendicular to the object's major axis. Combined with the existing capability to reach and interact with target objects, knowledge of these conditions allows the agent to learn increasingly reliable purposeful grasps. The first two conditions are addressed in this paper, and allow 45% of grasps to succeed. This work contributes toward the larger goal of foundational robot learning after the model of infant learning, with minimal prior knowledge of its own anatomy or its environment. The ability to grasp will allow the agent to control the motion and position of objects, providing a richer representation for its environment and new experiences to learn from. Show More",

Ideally, a robot should be able to pour with high accuracy to specific, pre-defined heights and without spilling. However, due to the complex dynamics of liquids, it is difficult to learn how to pour to achieve these goals. In this paper we present an approach to learn a policy for pouring using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG). We remove the need for collecting training experiences on a real robot, by using a state-of-the-art liquid simulator, which allows for learning the liquid dynamics. We show through our experiments, performed with a PR2 robot, that it is possible to successfully transfer the learned policy to a real robot and even apply it to different liquids.",

        "abstract": "Learning complex behaviors through reinforcement learning is particularly challenging when reward is only available upon successful completion of the full behavior. In manipulation robotics, so-called shaping rewards are often used to overcome this problem. However, these usually require human engineering or (partial)world models describing, e.g., the kinematics of the robot or high-level modules for perception. Here we propose an alternative method to learn an object palm-touching task through a weakly-supervised and stagewise learning of simpler tasks. First, the robot learns to fixate the object with its cameras. Second, the robot learns eye-hand coordination by learning to fixate its end effector. Third, using the previously acquired skills an informative shaping reward can be computed which facilitates efficient learning of the object palm-touching task. We demonstrate in simulation that learning the full task with this shaping reward is comparable to learning with an informative supervised reward.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Assessing grasp stability is essential to prevent the failure of robotic manipulation tasks due to sensory data and object uncertainties. Learning-based approaches are widely deployed to infer the success of a grasp. Typically, the underlying model used to estimate the grasp stability is trained for a specific task, such as lifting, hand-over, or pouring. Since every task has individual stability demands, it is important to adapt the trained model to new manipulation actions. If the same trained model is directly applied to a new task, unnecessary grasp adaptations might be triggered, or in the worst case, the manipulation might fail. To address this issue, we divide the manipulation task used for training into seven sub-tasks, defined as modular tasks. We deploy a learning-based approach and assess the stability for each modular task separately. We further propose analytical features to reduce the dimensionality and the redundancy of the tactile sensor readings. A main task can thereby be represented as a sequence of relevant modular tasks. The stability prediction of the main task is computed based on the inferred success labels of the modular tasks. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed feature set lowers the prediction error up to 5.69% compared to other sets used in state-of-the-art methods. Robotic experiments demonstrate that our modular task-oriented stability assessment avoids unnecessary grasp force adaptations and regrasps for various manipulation tasks.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Lower exoskeleton has gained considerable interests in walking assistance applications for both paraplegia and hemiplegia patients. In walking assistance of hemiplegia patients, the exoskeleton should have the ability to control the affected leg to follow the unaffected leg's motion naturally. One critical issue of walking assistance for hemiplegia patients is how to adapt the controller of both lower limbs with different patients. This paper presents a novel learning-based walking assistance control strategy for lower exoskeleton with hemiplegia patients. In the proposed control strategy, we modeled the control system of lower exoskeleton with hemiplegia patient as a Leader-Follower Multi-Agent System (LF -MAS). In order to adapt different patients with different conditions, reinforcement learning framework is utilized to adapt controllers online. In reinforcement learning framework with LF-MAS, we employed a Policy Iteration Adaptive Dynamic Programming (PI-ADP) algorithm, which aims to achieve better tracking control performance for lower exoskeleton with hemiplegia patient. We demonstrate the efficiency of proposed learning-based walking assistance control strategy in an exoskeleton system with healthy subjects who simulate hemiplegia patients. Experimental results indicate that the proposed control strategy can adapt different pilots with good tracking performance.",

The benefit of leveraging on the CPMs (which we apply anyway for other purposes like tracking) is that we can design highly efficient models for practical usage.

        "abstract": "Motion planning through optimization is largely based on locally improving the cost of a trajectory until an optimal solution is found. Choosing the initial trajectory has therefore a significant effect on the performance of the motion planner, especially when the cost landscape contains local minima. While multiple heuristics and approximations may be used to efficiently compute an initialization online, they are based on generic assumptions that do not always match the task at hand. In this paper, we exploit the fact that repeated tasks are similar according to some metric. We store solutions of the problem as a library of initial seed trajectories offline and employ a problem encoding to retrieve near-optimal warm-start initializations on-the-fly. We compare how different initialization strategies affect the global convergence and runtime of quasi-Newton and probabilistic inference solvers. Our analysis on the 38-DoF NASA Valkyrie robot shows that efficient and optimal planning in high-dimensional state spaces is possible despite the presence of globally non-smooth and discontinuous constraints, such as the ones imposed by collisions.",

Whereas other calibrations require the LiDAR reflectance data and an initial extrinsic parameter, the proposed method requires only the three-dimensional point cloud and the camera image. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated in experiments using several sensor configurations in indoor and outdoor scenes. Our method achieved higher accuracy than comparable state-of-the-art methods.",

Despite the availability of precise contour measurements, most state-of-the-art tracking systems still represent object geometry as bounding boxes. However, there are objects operating in public traffic for which the box assumption is highly inappropriate. We therefore propose to represent object contours using 2D polylines. Taking into account the mutual dependence of object poses and shape, our tracking framework targets at a simultaneous estimation of both states. Moreover, we propose to augment scan segments with free-space information at their boundaries and show how this knowledge can be incorporated into the tracking framework and beyond. Evaluation with real scan data shows that our method produces accurate dynamic estimates and consistent shape reconstructions.",

There has been, however, a growing interest in supplementing such maps with semantic information (e.g., object detections) using computer vision algorithms. Unfortunately, there is a disconnect between the relatively heavy computational requirements of these computer vision solutions, and the limited computation capacity available on mobile autonomous platforms. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap with a novel Markov Decision Process framework that adapts the parameters of the vision algorithms to the incoming video data rather than fixing them a priori. As a concrete example, we test our framework on a object detection and tracking task, showing significant benefits in terms of energy consumption without considerable loss in accuracy, using a combination of publicly available and novel datasets.",

In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight collision avoidance strategy that can be implemented as a low level motion control to achieve safe motion while simultaneously tracking the robot's reference control input. This strategy is designed to be general so that it can be easily integrated with most control designs, with the primary target of resource-constrained robot swarms that act in real-time, dynamic environments. The main advantages of our approach are a very simple structure and low computational requirements. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed collision avoidance strategy through two simulated scenarios and with physical robots.

        "abstract": "The proximity between the multirotor blades and the environmental obstacles restricts the application of aerial manipulators in inspection tasks due to the risk of impacts, the limitation in the reach of the arm, and the physical interactions. This paper presents a long reach aerial manipulator consisting of a hexarotor platform equipped with a 2-DOF compliant joint arm attached at the tip of a one-meter-length link in passive pendulum configuration. The arm integrates magnetic encoders for force/torque estimation-control based on joint deflection, a range sensor in the forearm link for measuring the distance to the contact point, and a camera for visual inspection. A 2-DOF wearable exoskeleton interface has been developed, allowing the teleoperation of the arm with visual feedback in a more intuitive way. The paper also covers the kinematics and dynamics of the aerial manipulator, including the dynamics of the flexible long reach link. The developed system has been evaluated in test-bench and in outdoor flight tests.",

        "abstract": "Progress in soft robotics depends on the integration of electronics for sensing, power regulation, and signal processing. Commercially available microelectronics satisfy these functions and are small enough to preserve the natural mechanics of the host system. Here, we present a method for incorporating microelectronic sensors and integrated circuits (ICs) into the elastomeric skin of a soft robot. The thin stretchable skin contains various solid-state electronics for orientation, pressure, proximity, and temperature sensing, and a microprocessor. The components are connected by thin-film copper traces wetted with eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn), a room temperature liquid metal alloy that allows the circuit to maintain conductivity as it deforms under mechanical loading. In this paper, we characterize the function of the individual sensors in air and water, discuss the integration of the microelectronic skin with a shape-memory actuated soft gripper, and demonstrate the sensorized soft gripper in conjunction with a 4 degree-of-freedom (DOF) robot arm.",

        "abstract": "Traditional Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) approaches build maps based on points, lines or planes. These maps visually resemble the environment but without any semantic or information about the objects in the environment. Recent advancements in machine learning have made object detection highly accurate and reliable with large set of objects. Object detection can effectively help SLAM to incorporate semantics in the mapping process. One of the main obstacles is data association between detected objects over time. We demonstrate a nonparametric statistical approach to solve the data association between detected objects over consecutive frames. Then we use an unsupervised clustering method to identify the existence of objects in the map. The complete process can be run in parallel with SLAM. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated on several public datasets, which shows promising results in locating objects in SLAM.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the source localization problem of an acoustic fish-tag using the Time-of-Arrival measurement of an acoustic signal, transmitted by the fish-tag. The Time-of-Arrival measurements denote the pseudo-range information between the acoustic receiver and the fish-tag, except that the Time-of-Transmission of the acoustic signal is unknown. Starting with the pseudo-range measurement equation, a globally valid quasi-linear time-varying measurement model is presented that is independent of the Time-of-Transmission of the acoustic signal. Using this measurement model, an Uniformly Globally Asymptotically Stable (UGAS), three stage estimation strategy (eXogenous Kalman Filter) is designed to estimate the position of an acoustic fish-tag and evaluated against a benchmark Extended Kalman Filter based estimator. The efficacy of the developed estimation method is demonstrated experimentally, in presence of intermittent observations using an array of receivers mounted on three Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs).",

        "abstract": "Many unmanned aerial vehicle surveillance and monitoring applications require observations at precise locations over long periods of time, ideally days or weeks at a time (e.g. ecosystem monitoring), which has been impractical due to limited endurance and the requirement of humans in the loop for operation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a fully autonomous small rotorcraft UAS that is capable of performing repeated sorties for long-term observation missions without any human intervention. We address two key technologies that are critical for such a system: full platform autonomy including emergency response to enable mission execution independently from human operators, and the ability of vision-based precision landing on a recharging station for automated energy replenishment. Experimental results of up to 11 hours of fully autonomous operation in indoor and outdoor environments illustrate the capability of our system.",

To overcome dynamic challenges when operating within an outdoors construction site, MAP incorporates a high-DoF 3D printing system connected to a mobile platform with novel features designed to enable disturbance rejection and live adaption to the robot's pose. In doing so, we demonstrate the benefits of designing construction robots with a focus on agility, a compact working volume and ability to operate within a potentially unlimited workspace. Performance tests were conducted showing smooth omni-directional motion as a key requirement for maintaining low 3D printing trajectory deviations over a large volume. In doing so, we show that MAP has the ability to construct in new ways more sensitive to its environment, context and concurrent on-site operations.",

Like its predecessor, the Cheetah 3 exploits tailored mechanical design to enable simple control strategies for dynamic locomotion and features high-bandwidth proprioceptive actuators to manage physical interaction with the environment. A new leg design is presented that includes proprioceptive actuation on the abduction/adduction degrees of freedom in addition to an expanded range of motion on the hips and knees. To make full use of these new capabilities, general balance and locomotion controllers for Cheetah 3 are presented. These controllers are embedded into a modular control architecture that allows the robot to handle unexpected terrain disturbances through reactive gait modification and without the need for external sensors or prior environment knowledge. The efficiency of the robot is demonstrated by a low Cost of Transport (CoT) over multiple gaits at moderate speeds, with the lowest CoT of 0.45 found during trotting. Experiments showcase the ability to blindly climb up stairs as a result of the full system integration. These results collectively represent a promising step toward a platform capable of generalized dynamic legged locomotion.",

        "abstract": "Some electric-powered wheelchairs are recently redefined as personal mobility devices. Their users are not only elderly or handicapped people, but also passengers with large baggage or pedestrians going from station to destination, i.e., last-mile transport. Consequently, people with different operation skills and expectations on personal mobility would become new users of this kind of devices. Safe and comfort travel in human co-existing environment such as sidewalks and airports is a social expectation for personal mobility. In order to realize this, understanding the operation skill of each user by a practical and simple method is essential. This paper thus introduced a skill level classification method by machine learning using only joystick data as input. In order to determine the number of skill level clusters, basic 26 features of joystick operation data are used for unsupervised clustering (single-linkage). We then made evaluation indexes by using speed, speed control, and direction control. For a five-level classification by using gradient boosting as supervised learning, we achieved a 67% accuracy (tolerance: 0) and a 98% accuracy (tolerance: 1). Further analysis of the feature importance of gradient boosting revealed key features to a good operation. Results also show that skill level differed among people with different driving experiences.",

        "abstract": "Microrobots are considered as promising tools for biomedical applications. However, the imaging of them becomes challenges in order to be further applied on in vivo environments. Here we report the magnetic navigation of a paramagnetic nanoparticle-based swarm using ultrasound images. The swarm can be generated using simple rotating magnetic fields, resulting in a region containing particles with a high area density. Ultrasound images of the swarm shows a periodic changing of imaging contrast. The reason for such dynamic contrast has been analyzed and experimental results are presented. Moreover, this swarm exhibits enhanced ultrasound imaging in comparison to that formed by individual nanoparticles with a low area density, and the relationship between imaging contrast and area density is testified. Furthermore, the microrobotic swarm can be navigated near a solid surface at different velocities, and the imaging contrast show negligible changes. This method allows us to localize and navigate a microrobotic swarm with enhanced ultrasound imaging indicating a promising approach for imaging of microrobots.",

In this study, we propose a fully dense, non-rigidly deformable, strictly real-time, intraoperative map fusion approach for actively controlled endoscopic capsule robot applications which combines magnetic and vision-based localization, with non-rigid deformations based frame-to-model map fusion. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using four different ex-vivo porcine stomach models. Across different trajectories of varying speed and complexity, and four different endoscopic cameras, the root mean square surface reconstruction errors vary from 1.58 to 2.17 cm.",

Simulations for the kinematic model of a soft continuum manipulator and preliminary experiments with a 2-segments soft continuum arm are performed, showing promising results and the potential for our approach to be applied widely.",

By exploiting its high degrees of freedom, Magneto is able to deform its body shape to squeeze through gaps of 23cm, which is smaller than standard human entry portholes of industrial confined spaces. Its compact foot design of footprint 4cm allows Magneto to walk on narrow beams of thickness less than 5cm, even at varying separation. The inherent high dimensional system design enables the body to be positioned in a wide range of orientations and seamlessly switch a limb function from locomotion to manipulation mode mid-climb. This capability enables access to confined space openings and occluded pockets and navigation through complex 3-D structures previously not demonstrated on legged climbing robots.",

        "abstract": "This article studies imitation learning policies that encode task compliance to provide teleoperation assistance for remote manufacturing. The central challenge is how to handle off-nominal situations, such as out-of-sequence work or unplanned obstacles, since the assistance has not been trained to handle such scenarios. In such cases, there is potential for the assistance to degrade-rather than improve-operator performance. This work proposes a method that exploits the learned task compliance to classify persistent human actions as off-nominal, and attenuate assistance in these regions. Applied to a hole-cleaning task with n = 11 subjects, the proposed method shows up to 17% reduction in task completion time and up to 68% reduction in forces in off-nominal situations as compared to assistance without the method. Additionally, the method retains the performance improvements of assistance in nominal operating regimes.",

        "abstract": "We present a manipulation planning algorithm for a robot to keep an object stable under changing external forces. We particularly focus on the case where a human may be applying forceful operations, e.g. cutting or drilling, on an object that the robot is holding. The planner produces an efficient plan by intelligently deciding when the robot should change its grasp on the object as the human applies the forces. The planner also tries to choose subsequent grasps such that they will minimize the number of regrasps that will be required in the long-term. Furthermore, as it switches from one grasp to the other, the planner solves the problem of bimanual regrasp planning, where the object is not placed on a support surface, but instead it is held by a single gripper until the second gripper moves to a new position on the object. This requires the planner to also reason about the stability of the object under gravity. We provide an implementation on a bimanual robot and present experiments to show the performance of our planner.",

        "abstract": "Making an optimal decision to avoid obstacles while heading to the goal is one of the fundamental challenges for mobile robots equipped with limited computational resources. In this paper, we present a deep imitation learning algorithm that develops a computationally efficient obstacle avoidance policy based on egocentric local occupancy maps. The trained model embedded with a variant of the value iteration networks is able to provide near-optimal continuous action commands through fast feed-forward inferences and generalize well to unseen planning-based scenarios. To improve the policy robustness, we augment the training data set with artificially generated maps, which effectively alleviates the shortage of catastrophic samples in normal demonstrations. Extensive experiments on a Segway robot show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of solution optimality, robustness as well as computation time.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Currently, the manufacturing of self-actuating and self-sensing robots requires non-standard manufacturing techniques and assembly steps to integrate electrical and mechanical systems. In this work, we developed a novel manufacturing technique, where such robots can be produced at a flexible electronics factory. We developed the technique using standard industrial machines, processes, and materials. Using a lamination process, we were able to integrate air pouches or shape memory alloy (SMA) inside a polyamide-based flexible circuit to produce bending actuators. The bend angle of the actuators is sensed with a chain of inertial measurement units integrated on the actuator. Air-pouch actuators can produce a force of a 2.24N, and a maximum bend angle of 74 degrees. To demonstrate, we manufactured a five-legged robot with the developed actuators and bend sensors, with all the supporting electronics (e.g., microcontrollers, radio) directly integrated into the flexible printed circuit. Such robots are flat and lightweight (15 grams) and thus conveniently compact for transportation and storage. We believe that our technique can allow inexpensive and fast prototyping and deployment of self-actuating and self-sensing robots.",

By variating the spatial resolution and the exciter frequency during the measurement in mutual capacitive mode, information about the dielectrical properties of different objects was captured and provided as data frames. For material recognition an artificial neural network was set up and fed with various data sets of different electrode combinations and exciter frequencies. The influence of the electrode combinations and shapes on the recognition accuracy was investigated. It is shown that seven objects of conductive and non-conductive dielectric materials have been ranged with an overall accuracy of about 71%-94%.",

We present the construction details, list the key performance characteristics and demonstrate an example application of finding the end of an adhesive tape roll using the signals captured by the sensors integrated in the nail.

        "abstract": "A new robotic system for Search And Rescue (SAR) operations based on the automatic wristband placement on the victims' arm, which may provide identification, beaconing and remote sensor readings for continuous health monitoring. This paper focuses on the development of the automatic target localization and the device placement using an unmanned aerial manipulator. The automatic wrist detection and localization system uses an RGB-D camera and a convolutional neural network based on the region faster method (Faster R-CNN). A lightweight parallel delta manipulator with a large workspace has been built, and a new design of a wristband in the form of a passive detachable gripper, is presented, which, under contact, automatically attaches to the human, while disengages from the manipulator. A new trajectory planning method has been used to minimize the torques caused by the external forces during contact, which cause attitude perturbations. Experiments have been done to evaluate the machine learning method for detection and location, and for the assessment of the performance of the trajectory planning method. The results show how the VGG-16 neural network provides a detection accuracy of 67.99%. Moreover, simulation experiments have been done to show that the new trajectories minimize the perturbations to the aerial platform.",

We propose a miniature robot finger driven by a new micro linear ultrasonic motor as a key component for micro robot hands. It enables dexterous and multiple motions for micro hands used in limited spaces. In this paper, we build a new micro linear ultrasonic motor involving a cuboid stator with a side length of approximately 2 mm, making it one of the smallest linear motors. The micro linear ultrasonic motor prototype shows an output torque of approximately 7.75 mN at low voltage operation, which is sufficient force to handle tiny objects. The miniature finger, a closed-loop six-bar-linkage mechanism, is built by micro fabrication and connected to the motor prototype. The first demonstration of the miniature finger is shown under a high-speed camera with a high power lens.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "With the advent of polygonal maps finding their way into the navigational software of mobile robots, the Visibility Graph can be used to search for the shortest collision-free path. The nature of the Visibility Graph-based shortest path algorithms is such that first the entire graph is computed in a relatively time-consuming manner. Then, the graph can be searched efficiently any number of times for varying start and target state combinations with the A* or the Dijkstra algorithm. However, real-world environments are typically too dynamic for a map to remain valid for a long time. With the goal of obtaining the shortest path quickly in an ever changing environment, we introduce a rapid path finding algorithm-Minimal Construct-that discovers only a necessary portion of the Visibility Graph around the obstacles that actually get in the way. Collision tests are computed only for lines that seem heuristically promising. This way, shortest paths can be found much faster than with a state-of-the-art Visibility Graph algorithm and as our experiments show, even grid-based A* searches are outperformed in most cases with the added benefit of smoother and shorter paths.",

        "abstract": "Multistage decision policies provide useful control strategies in high-dimensional state spaces, particularly in complex control tasks. However, they exhibit weak performance guarantees in the presence of disturbance, model mismatch, or model uncertainties. This brittleness limits their use in high-risk scenarios. We present how to quantify the sensitivity of such policies in order to inform of their robustness capacity. We also propose a minimax iterative dynamic game framework for designing robust policies in the presence of disturbance/uncertainties. We test the quantification hypothesis on a carefully designed deep neural network policy; we then pose a minimax iterative dynamic game (iDG) framework for improving policy robustness in the presence of adversarial disturbances. We evaluate our iDG framework on a mecanum-wheeled robot, whose goal is to find a ocally robust optimal multistage policy that achieve a given goal-reaching task. The algorithm is simple and adaptable for designing meta-learning/deep policies that are robust against disturbances, model mismatch, or model uncertainties, up to a disturbance bound.

        "abstract": "Typical continuum robots, such as pneumatic and tendon-driven robots, have a restricted section length and require a large external component for pulleys and a compressor, making them unsuitable for locomotion. This paper presents a new mobile continuum robot design with virtually unlimited extensible sections. A driving unit, which has a mechanism similar to the rack-and-pinion, consists of three DC motors with gears, each of which moves each flexible tube. The rotation of the motor translates the flexible tube, which has a helical groove on the surface that meshes with the gear. The long flexible tube provides a large traveling distance as long as it does not buckle. The elongation and bending motion of each section may be controlled during operation by varying the speed of each flexible tube. This design not only allows the expansion of the robot to otherwise unreachable work areas but also improves the locomotion velocity by generating a large traveling distance of the flexible tubes. The most important point in this paper is to use multiple driving units for locomotion. Since all the driving units can be mounted on the same tubes, by increasing the number of them, the robot can take various forms without expanding its diameter. A preliminary prototype was built, and its crawling locomotion performance was tested using two operating sequences. The results indicate that earthworm-like locomotion can be achieved with good performance by elongating the sections even when the ground is slippery. The proposed design can be easily be rebuilt by anyone with access to a basic 3D printer.",

A basic method of improving the robustness of a robot is considering the sensor observations obtained from mapped obstacles and using them for localizing the robot's pose. This study proposes an observation model that considers the class of sensor observations, where \u201cclass\u201d categorizes the sensor observations as those obtained from mapped and unmapped obstacles. In the proposed approach, the robot's pose and the class are estimated simultaneously. As a result, the robot's pose can be localized using the sensor observations obtained only from mapped obstacles. First, we evaluated the performance of the proposed approach using simulations. Further, we tested the proposed approach in a real-world mobile robot navigation competition, called \u201cTsukuba Challenge,\u201d held in Japan. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach against environment dynamics were verified from the experimental results.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel approach for optimal trajectory tracking for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), using a linear model predictive controller (MPC) in combination with non-linear state feedback. The solution relies on fast onboard simulation of the translational dynamics of the UAV, which is guided by a linear MPC. By sampling the states of the virtual UAV, we create a control command for fast non-linear feedback, which is capable of performing agile maneuvers with high precision. In addition, the proposed pipeline provides an interface for a decentralized collision avoidance system for multi-UAY scenarios. Our solution makes use of the long prediction horizon of the linear MPC and allows safe outdoors execution of multi-UAV experiments without the need for in-advance collision-free planning. The practicality of the tracking mechanism is shown in combination with priority-based collision resolution strategy, which performs sufficiently in experiments with up to 5 UAVs. We present a statistical and experimental evaluation of the platform in both simulation and real-world examples, demonstrating the usability of the approach.",

        "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has achieved great strides in solving challenging motion control tasks. Recently, there has been significant work on methods for exploiting the data gathered during training, but there has been less work on how to best generate the data to learn from. For continuous action domains, the most common method for generating exploratory actions involves sampling from a Gaussian distribution centred around the mean action output by a policy. Although these methods can be quite capable, they do not scale well with the dimensionality of the action space, and can be dangerous to apply on hardware. We consider learning a forward dynamics model to predict the result, (xt+1), of taking a particular action, (u), given a specific observation of the state, (xt). With this model we perform internal lookahead predictions of outcomes and seek actions we believe have a reasonable chance of success. This method alters the exploratory action space, thereby increasing learning speed and enables higher quality solutions to difficult problems, such as robotic locomotion and juggling.",

        "abstract": "A concept consisting of a new configurable vacuum gripper system and a corresponding method for determining optimal grasp configurations solely based on 3D vision is introduced. The robot system consists of a dynamically configurable vacuum gripper, a visual sensor, and a robot arm that are used in combination with a new grasp planner to robustly grasp unknown objects in arbitrary positions. For this purpose, formalized aspects of selecting contact surfaces for arbitrary suction cups are described; the concept involves visual detection of the objects, segmentation, iterative grasp planning, and action execution. The approach allows for a fast and efficient, yet precise execution of grasps. The core idea is a two-step 3D data acquisition approach and grasp point computation that takes advantage of the fact that the suction cups of the gripper can all be aligned axis-parallel. Therefore, an adequate sensor-based surface acquisition is done from a single viewpoint with respect to the gripper. Results of realworld experiments show that the proposed concept is suitable for a wide range of different and unknown objects in our setup.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of grasping arbitrarily shaped objects, observed as partial point-clouds, without requiring: models of the objects, physics parameters, training data, or other a-priori knowledge. A grasp metric is proposed based on Local Contact Moment (LoCoMo). LoCoMo combines zero-moment shift features, of both hand and object surface patches, to determine local similarity. This metric is then used to search for a set of feasible grasp poses with associated grasp likelihoods. LoCoMo overcomes some limitations of both classical grasp planners and learning-based approaches. Unlike force-closure analysis, LoCoMo does not require knowledge of physical parameters such as friction coefficients, and avoids assumptions about fingertip contacts, instead enabling robust contacts of large areas of hand and object surface. Unlike more recent learning-based approaches, LoCoMo does not require training data, and does not need any prototype grasp configurations to be taught by kinesthetic demonstration. We present results of real-robot experiments grasping 21 different objects, observed by a wrist-mounted depth camera. All objects are grasped successfully when presented to the robot individually. The robot also successfully clears cluttered heaps of objects by sequentially grasping and lifting objects until none remain.",

To this end, two human performers fist perform social interactions according to the Learning from Demonstration paradigm. Then, the relative relevance of all joints of both performers should be reasonably modeled based on human demonstrations. However, among all possible combinations of relative joints, it is necessary to select only some of the combinations that play key roles in social interaction. We select such significant features based on the joint motion significance, which is a metric to measure the significance degree by calculating both temporal entropy and spatial entropy of all human joints from a Gaussian mixture model. To evaluate our proposed method, we performed experiments on five social interactions: hand shaking, hand slapping, shoulder holding, object passing, and target kicking. In addition, we compared our method to existing modeling methods using different metrics, such as principal component analysis and information gain.",

        "abstract": "When a human supervisor collaborates with a team of robots, the human's attention is divided, and cognitive resources are at a premium. We aim to optimize the distribution of these resources and the flow of attention. To this end, we propose the model of an idealized supervisor to describe human behavior. Such a supervisor employs a potentially inaccurate internal model of the the robots' dynamics to judge safety. We represent these safety judgements by constructing a safe set from this internal model using reachability theory. When a robot leaves this safe set, the idealized supervisor will intervene to assist, regardless of whether or not the robot remains objectively safe. False positives, where a human supervisor incorrectly judges a robot to be in danger, needlessly consume supervisor attention. In this work, we propose a method that decreases false positives by learning the supervisor's safe set and using that information to govern robot behavior. We prove that robots behaving according to our approach will reduce the occurrence of false positives for our idealized supervisor model. Furthermore, we empirically validate our approach with a user study that demonstrates a significant (p = 0.0328) reduction in false positives for our method compared to a baseline safety controller.",

Here, we extend this result of [1] to the case of load manipulation with flexibility, which is crucial for long/slender object manipulation, yet, not considered in [1]. We first provide a rigorous modeling of the load flexibility and its effects on the MAGMaS dynamics. We then propose a novel collaborative control framework for flexible load-tip pose tracking, where the ground manipulator provides slower nominal pose tracking with overall load weight holding, whereas the aerial robot allows for faster vibration suppression with some load weight sharing. We also discuss the issue of controllability stemming from that the aerial robot provides less number of actuation than the modes of the load flexibility; and elucidate some peculiar conditions for this vibration suppression controllability. Simulations are also performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theory.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents dynamic modeling and control of an articulated robotic tail to maneuver and stabilize a reduced degree-of-freedom (DOF) quadruped robot. Conventional legged robotic systems consist of leg mechanisms that provide simultaneous propulsion, maneuvering and stabilization. However, in nature animals have been observed to utilize their tails to assist the legs in multiple tasks. Similarly, by incorporating an articulated tail onboard a quadruped robot, dynamic tail motions can be used to aid maneuvering. Therefore, tail implementation can potentially lead to simplifications in design and control of the legged robot since the legs will be responsible for only propulsion tasks. In this paper, a robotic system design consisting of an articulated tail and quadruped robot system is presented. Dynamic models are derived to analyze an optimal tail mass and length ratio to enhance inertial adjustment applications and develop an outer loop controller to plan tail trajectories for desired maneuvering applications. Results of analytical optimization are corroborated with measured data from biological animals. To decouple the dynamics of the articulated tail mechanism an inner loop controller using feedback linearization maps the desired behavior to the actuator inputs. This approach is validated using hardware-in-the-loop experiments with tail prototype in conjunction with simulated quadruped platform. Results demonstrate the capabilities of the articulated tail in enabling precise left and right turning (maneuvering).",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Research on legged robots has developed rapidly in the recent decades. One-legged robots, unlike multi-legged ones, have only one type of motion, called hopping. Hopping motion is generally divided into stance and flight phases. Switching between these two phases represents a hybrid dynamic model. Dynamic stabilization of hopping motion is a challenging control issue. Most of one-legged hopping robots studied in the past are able to hop with their one springy leg. In this paper, a novel one-legged robot is introduced and studied with two springs on the two sides. The one-legged somersaulting robot is able to hop with both springy sides. This ability causes lower energy consumption in passing obstacles and a longer step length in comparison with well-known SLIP robots with hopping motion stemming from the fact that it only has one rotary actuator. Fuzzy logic control is applied to achieve a stable limit cycle in the robot's somersaulting motion.",

        "abstract": "A completely new compliant lightweight robot is presented with a kinematic loop and a highly flexible link. It is explained how to model such parallel robots accurately but still computationally efficient. The elastic deformations are described with the floating frame of reference approach. For the flexible components this allows to use linear finite element models, which can represent arbitrary geometries. These models are further reduced by modal truncation and a Component Mode Synthesis minimizing the number of elastic degrees of freedom, which is necessary for real-time control purposes. The obtained model of the underactuated robot is non-minimum phase for the end-effector as output. Thus, for the applied trajectory tracking controller which is based on servo constraints, the concept of stable inversion is used. The performance is compared to a relocated minimum phase output. Corresponding simulations are validated by first experimental results showing the need for and high accuracy of the flexible model and the trajectory tracking control.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents modeling of robotic fish propelled by a hybrid tail with Servo and IPMC actuated two joints. The first joint is driven by a servo motor, which generates flapping motion for main propulsion. The second joint is actuated by a soft actuator, or ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) artificial muscle, which directs the propelled fluid for steering. A dynamic model is developed to capture the 2D motion dynamics of the robotic fish. The model fully captures the actuation dynamics of the IPMC soft actuator, two-link tail motion dynamics, and body motion dynamics. Experimental results have shown that the robotic fish is capable of swimming forward (up to 0.45 body length/second) and turning left and right (up to 40 degree/sec) with a small turning radius (less than half a body length). Finally, the dynamic model has been validated with experimental data, in terms of steady-state forward speed and turning speed versus the flapping frequency.",

        "abstract": "Precise actuation of continuum surfaces in combination with continuum robotic arms that undergo large deformation is of high interest in soft robotics but of limited model-based study to date. This work develops this area towards enabling the robust design and control of large deformation continuum surfaces (LDCS) across multiple industrial applications in the healthcare, aerospace, manufacturing, and automotive domains. It introduces an actuation based dynamic model of LDCSs to accurately determine their deflection due to application of concentrated external forces while maintaining many physical characteristics and constraints on actuation elements and surface structure such as gravity, inertia, damping, elasticity, and interactive forces between actuators and LDCS. Using the lumped-mass methodology, a 3D integrated surface-arm model is developed, simulated and then validated experimentally where a pair of parallel arms are attached to the surface to actuate and deform it. The surface is then simultaneously subjected to a concentrated constant external force at its top center between the two arms. Comparing measured displacements between the experimental and modelling results over actuation time yielded the maximum error is less than 1% of the length of the surface's side at its final deflected profile despite the limited number of nodes (masses) used in the LDCS model while it is exposed to a significant external force.",

Unlike most classical model-based controllers, the proposed controller does not require any prior estimation of the system's model parameters. The AAFO system is actively driven by the residual human torque delivered by muscles spanning the ankle joint and the AAFO's actuator's torque. The ankle reference trajectory is updated online based on the self-selected walking speed of the wearer. The input-to-state stability of the AAFO-wearer system with respect to a bounded human muscular torque is proved in closed-loop based on a Lyapunov analysis. Experimental results, obtained from one healthy subject and one paretic patient, show satisfactory results in terms of tracking performance and ankle joint assistance throughout the full gait cycle.",

        "abstract": "Sensor fusion is a fundamental process in robotic systems as it extends the perceptual range and increases robustness in real-world operations. Current multi-sensor deep learning based semantic segmentation approaches do not provide robustness to under-performing classes in one modality, or require a specific architecture with access to the full aligned multi-sensor training data. In this work, we analyze statistical fusion approaches for semantic segmentation that overcome these drawbacks while keeping a competitive performance. The studied approaches are modular by construction, allowing to have different training sets per modality and only a much smaller subset is needed to calibrate the statistical models. We evaluate a range of statistical fusion approaches and report their performance against state-of-the-art baselines on both realworld and simulated data. In our experiments, the approach improves performance in IoU over the best single modality segmentation results by up to 5%. We make all implementations and configurations publicly available.",

The tracking performance of piezoelectric actuator is mainly affected by the hysteresis nonlinearity. Sliding mode control is a possible solution to achieve better tracking performance. However, conventional sliding mode control generates discontinuous control signal which results in chattering. Hence, the hysteresis nonlinearity is first compensated with a hysteresis model, and an uncertainty and disturbance estimator is designed and included to devise a smooth control action. The stability of the proposed method is demonstrated via Lyapunov analysis. Both simulation and experiment are also conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results are compared with a conventional sliding mode controller and a proportional-integral control with notch filter (PIC-NF).",

        "abstract": "Task level programming based on skills has often been proposed as a mean to decrease programming complexity of industrial robots. Several models are based on encapsulating complex motions into self-contained primitive blocks. A semantic skill is then defined as a deterministic sequence of these primitives. A major limitation is that existing frameworks do not support the coordination of concurrent motion primitives with possible interference. This decreases their reusability and scalability in unstructured environments where a dynamic and reactive adaptation of motions is often required. This paper presents a novel framework that generates adaptive behaviors by modeling skills as concurrent motion primitives activated dynamically when conditions trigger. The approach exploits the additive property of motion generators to superpose multiple contributions. We demonstrate the applicability on a real assembly use-case and discuss the gained benefits.",

        "abstract": "Robots that navigate among pedestrians use collision avoidance algorithms to enable safe and efficient operation. Recent works present deep reinforcement learning as a framework to model the complex interactions and cooperation. However, they are implemented using key assumptions about other agents' behavior that deviate from reality as the number of agents in the environment increases. This work extends our previous approach to develop an algorithm that learns collision avoidance among a variety of types of dynamic agents without assuming they follow any particular behavior rules. This work also introduces a strategy using LSTM that enables the algorithm to use observations of an arbitrary number of other agents, instead of previous methods that have a fixed observation size. The proposed algorithm outperforms our previous approach in simulation as the number of agents increases, and the algorithm is demonstrated on a fully autonomous robotic vehicle traveling at human walking speed.",

This involves solving a multitude of problems, including goal assignment, motion planning, and coordination, while maximizing some performance criterion. While methods for solving these sub-problems have been studied, they address only a facet of the overall problem, and make strong assumptions on the use-case, on the environment, or on the robots in the fleet. In this paper, we formulate the overall fleet management problem in terms of Optimal Control. We describe a scheme for solving this problem in the particular case of fleets of non-holonomic robots navigating in an environment with obstacles. The method is based on a two-phase approach, whereby the first phase solves for fleet-wide boolean decision variables via Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming, and the second phase solves for real-valued variables to obtain an optimized set of trajectories for the fleet. Examples showcasing the features of the method are illustrated, and the method is validated experimentally.",

        "abstract": "A motion planner is developed for guiding a small aerobatic fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle to a desired goal region in a highly constrained, three-dimensional, known environment with static obstacles. The planner is based on the Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithm, and pieces together feasible trajectories from a library of motion primitives. Among other more conventional motion primitives, the library includes three extreme maneuvers: a cruise-to-hover transition, a hover-to-cruise transition, and an aggressive turn-around. The algorithm is efficient; it can be run in real-time to rapidly generate a plan starting from the aircraft's configuration at run-time. The motion planner is closely coupled to a feedback controller. Simulations using an aircraft dynamics model demonstrate the effectiveness of the system to guide and control the aircraft to a desired goal region. Preliminary flight test results are also presented.",

        "abstract": "This paper develops and compares two motion planning algorithms for a tethered UAV with and without the possibility of the tether contacting the confined and cluttered environment. Tethered aerial vehicles have been studied due to their advantages such as power duration, stability, and safety. However, the disadvantages brought in by the extra tether have not been well investigated by the robotic locomotion community, especially when the tethered agent is locomoting in a non-free space occupied with obstacles. In this work, we propose two motion planning frameworks that (1) reduce the reachable configuration space by taking into account the tether and (2) deliberately plan (and relax) the contact point(s) of the tether with the environment and enable an equivalent reachable configuration space as the non-tethered counterpart would have. Both methods are tested on a physical robot, Fotokite Pro. With our approaches, tethered aerial vehicles could find their applications in confined and cluttered environments with obstacles as opposed to ideal free space, while still maintaining the advantages from the usage of a tether. The motion planning strategies are particularly suitable for marsupial heterogeneous robotic teams, such as visual servoing/assisting for another mobile, tele-operated primary robot.",

        "abstract": "Intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicle or I-AUV has recently started to grab researchers attention in the last 20 years. Only three I-AUVs have demonstrated autonomous manipulation skills: ALIVE, SAUVIM and GIRONA 500. While prior systems rely on variations of the task-priority redundancy control framework, our recent research showed preliminary results using motion planning for floating-based intervention in the presence of obstacles. With the increasing need for autonomously performing more complex manipulation tasks, two main challenges need to be addressed: the high-dimensionality of the system, and the motion coordination between the mobile base and the working arm. The latter challenge is of high importance if accurate execution is required, especially considering the floating nature of the AUV and the control challenges that come with it. Our approach relies on exploiting the loose coupling between the AUV and the arm. In particular we present an approach based on MR-MHA * (Multi-Representation, Multi-Heuristic A*), and we show how it can generate efficient trajectories by exploiting decoupling. We show for the first time the use of a search-based planner on a high-dimensional underwater manipulator. In addition, we support our claims with experimental analysis of the generated trajectories with respect to various metrics in different environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our approach to conduct a full intervention mission in a realistic simulated underwater intervention environment.",

        "abstract": "Simulation is an appealing option for validating the safety of autonomous vehicles. Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) has recently been shown to learn representative human driver models. These human driver models were learned through training in single-agent environments, but they have difficulty in generalizing to multi-agent driving scenarios. We argue these difficulties arise because observations at training and test time are sampled from different distributions. This difference makes such models unsuitable for the simulation of driving scenes, where multiple agents must interact realistically over long time horizons. We extend GAIL to address these shortcomings through a parameter-sharing approach grounded in curriculum learning. Compared with single-agent GAIL policies, policies generated by our PS-GAIL method prove superior at interacting stably in a multi-agent setting and capturing the emergent behavior of human drivers.",

The goal of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of coordination strategies for improving the weeding performance of autonomous agricultural robots. We show that, given a sufficient number of agents, the algorithm can successfully weed fields with various initial seed bank densities, even when multiple days are allowed to elapse before weeding commences. Furthermore, the use of coordination between agents is demonstrated to strongly improve system performance as the number of agents increases, enabling the system to eliminate all the weeds in the field, as in the case of full environmental information, when the planner without coordination failed to do so. As a domain to test our algorithms, we have developed an open source simulation environment, Weed World, which allows real-time visualization of coordinated weeding policies, and includes realistic weed generation. In this work, experiments are conducted to determine the required number of agents and their required transit speed, for given initial seed bank densities and varying allowed days before the start of the weeding process.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a model-based approach for creating robust control policies for rolling locomotion with a spherical tensegrity topology. Utilizing the structured dynamics of Class-1 tensegrity systems, we turn to model predictive control (MPC) to generate optimal multi-cable actuation trajectories for dynamic rolling. Although the resulting multi-cable state-action trajectories successfully outperform the benchmark single-cable policy performance in speed, computational constraints prevent MPC from being applied in real-time. To address this, we demonstrate that a contextual policy trained using supervised deep learning on the generated optimal MPC trajectories can be used as an end-to-end feedback policy for real-time directed rolling locomotion.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel 3D coverage path planning method, which is efficient and practical for inspection of high-rise structures such as buildings or towers, using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is presented. Our approach basically focuses on developing a model-based path planner for structural inspection with a prior map, which is opposite to a non-model based exploration. The proposed method uses a volumetric map which is made before the path planning. With the map, the whole structure is divided into several layers for efficient path planning. Firstly, in each layer, a set of the normal vectors of the center point of every voxel is calculated, and then the opposing vectors become viewpoints. Due to too many viewpoints and an overlapped inspection surface, we down-sample them with a voxel grid filter. Then, the shortest tour connecting the reduced viewpoints must be computed with the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solver. Lastly, all the paths in each layer are combined to form the complete path. The results are verified using simulations with a rotary wing UAV and compared with other state-of-the-art algorithm. It is proven that our method performs much better for structural inspection with respect to computation time as well as the coverage completeness.",

In addition to the details given about the main modules (and their interactions) composing the proposed MCA, an important focus of the paper is made on the definition of a robust Two-Sequential Level Decision Network (TSLDN), which uses both: Extended Time-To-Collision (ETTC) metric and a new definition of a specific Predicted Inter-Distance Profile (PIDP, between vehicles during lane changes maneuvers) in order to estimate the maneuvers risks. The TSLDN is utilized for: the driving situation assessment, decision-making and for safety retrospection over the current maneuver risk. It allows us to have the best decision to achieve the vehicle navigation task while maximizing its safety. Several simulation results show the good performance of the overall proposed control architecture, mainly in terms of efficiency to handle probabilistic decision-making even for very risky scenarios.",

Current wall climbing robots in literature overlook statically indeterminate forces, causing an incapability to estimate climbing failure under certain circumstances. Accounting for these forces, robot deformation can be approximated, paving the way for the proposed two-wall climbing approach. During a wall climb, two failure modes, slide and over-torque, are identified to compute feasible climbing region. A hexapod robot is used to verify the proposed technique by climbing between walls with pure friction end effectors.",

        "abstract": "Robot learning by demonstration gives robots the ability to learn tasks which they have not been programmed to do before. The paradigm allows robots to work in a greater range of real-world applications in our daily life. However, this paradigm has traditionally been applied to learn tasks from a single demonstration modality. This restricts the approach to be scaled to learn and execute a series of tasks in a real-life environment. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal learning approach using DMP+ with linear decay integrated in a dialogue system with speech and ontology for the robot to learn seamlessly through natural interaction modalities (like an apprentice) while learning or re-learning is done on the fly to allow partial updates to a learned task to reduce potential user fatigue and operational downtime in teaching. The performance of new DMP+ with linear decay system is statistically benchmarked against state-of-the-art DMP implementations. A gluing demonstration is also conducted to show how the system provides seamless learning of multiple tasks in a flexible manufacturing set-up.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a switching strategy of a region-based shape controller for a swarm-robotic framework to overcome the traditional obstacle-avoidance problem in the virtual structure methodology. In this control approach, initially, the robots move as a group inside a circular region which we conceive to be the initial virtual structure, while preserving a specific pattern, say a triangular formation, among them. In order to avoid static/dynamic obstacles, while approaching towards the target without any prior knowledge about the environment, the virtual-circle is allowed to shrink up to a certain limit. The shrinking phenomena of the virtual circle will depend upon the number of agents within the circle and the distance between two the nearest obstacles sensed by the agents through which the swarm should be able to pass. If the situation demands, the structure may assume the shape of an ellipse of equivalent area continually throughout the path described by the swarm encapsulated within the variable structure. To achieve this, two-layer hierarchical control strategy has been proposed. Moreover, if the shape of the virtual structure changes, the formation of the swarm inside the region may also change. To make the inter-agent formation flexible inside the newly formed virtual structure, a spanning-tree-assisted-shape-matching algorithm has been employed for accommodating all the agents inside the virtual region which helps in the formation change in the agents as well. Finally, simulation results and stability analysis of the controllers are provided to demonstrate our proposed technique.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Recently, self-supervised approach is common for robot grasping. Although this approach improves success rate, it requires a long time to execute a number of grasp trials, and single-arm grasping is only considered. However, robots can grasp more various objects with two arms, and dual-arm robots such as humanoid robots are expected to execute dual-arm manipulation and overcome the single-arm limitation. In this paper, we introduce dual-arm grasping as another possible strategy and propose a multi-stage learning method for selective dual-arm grasping using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)for grasping point prediction and semantic segmentation. In the first stage, the network learns grasping points with the automatic annotation. Although a robot learns both single-arm and dual-arm grasping efficiently with the annotation, the robot may not be able to grasp it because the annotation algorithm is designed by human. Therefore, for the second stage, the robot samples various grasping points with both grasping strategies and learns how to grasp in the real world. In this stage, the robot obtains new possible grasping points and prunes unsuccessful ones for both grasping strategies through the robot experience. In the experiments in the real world, the adapted network achieved high success rate 76.7% in 90 trials. Since the network trained with no adaptation stage resulted in lower success rate 56.7%, this result also shows the network was refined with less than 250 times of grasp sampling. As an application of our method, we demonstrated that our system worked well in warehouse picking task.",

Exploiting the longer context of raw speech signals seems useful in improving recognition accuracy. However, naive use of longer contexts results in the loss of short-term patterns; thus, recognition accuracy degrades. We propose a multi-timescale feature-extraction architecture of DNNs with blocks of different time scales, which enable capturing long- and short-term patterns of speech signals. Each block consists of complex-valued networks that correspond to Fourier and filterbank transformations for analysis. Experiments showed that the proposed multi-timescale architecture reduced the word error rate by about 3% compared with those only with the longterm context. Analysis of the extracted features revealed that our architecture efficiently captured the slow and fast changes of speech features.",

        "abstract": "From archaeology to the inspection of subsea structures, underwater mapping has become critical to many applications. Because of the balanced trade-off between range and resolution, multibeam sonars are often used as the primary sensor in underwater mapping platforms. These sonars output an image representing the intensity of the received acoustic echos over space, which must be classified into free and occupied regions before range measurements are determined and spatially registered. Most classifiers found in the underwater mapping literature use local thresholding techniques, which are highly sensitive to noise, outliers, and sonar artifacts typically found in these images. In this paper we present an overview of some of the techniques developed in the scope of our work on sonar-based underwater mapping, with the aim of improving map accuracy through better segmentation performance. We also provide experimental results using data collected with a DIDSON imaging sonar that show that these techniques improve both segmentation accuracy and robustness to outliers.",

        "abstract": "Interactive robots offer improved performance in tasks with environmental uncertainty, but accommodating environment input weakens predictions of contact force or position trajectories, making the identification of subtask completion or faults difficult. This paper develops a task monitoring approach for complex assembly tasks that involve transitions between discrete environment dynamic modes. In semi-structured environments, these dynamic modes and their transitions are approximately known a priori, allowing task monitoring through estimation of the current mode and fault detection as a deviation from expected, desired dynamic mode transitions. This allows a more natural description of many interactive tasks, improving robustness to variations in force or position trajectories that impedance control seeks to address. The ability of impedance and admittance controlled robots to identify their environment is investigated, making consideration of joint and end-effector physical compliance. Prior information on environment dynamics and mode transitions allow recursive estimates of dynamic mode suitable for online use, under both full state knowledge and only force/position measurements. Experiments with an admittance controlled robot in a gear assembly task validate the approach.",

        "abstract": "Estimating motion from images is a well-studied problem in computer vision and robotics. Previous work has developed techniques to estimate the motion of a moving camera in a largely static environment (e.g., visual odometry) and to segment or track motions in a dynamic scene using known camera motions (e.g., multiple object tracking). It is more challenging to estimate the unknown motion of the camera and the dynamic scene simultaneously. Most previous work requires a priori object models (e.g., tracking-by-detection), motion constraints (e.g., planar motion), or fails to estimate the full SE (3) motions of the scene (e.g., scene flow). While these approaches work well in specific application domains, they are not generalizable to unconstrained motions. This paper extends the traditional visual odometry (VO) pipeline to estimate the full SE (3) motion of both a stereo/RGB-D camera and the dynamic scene. This multimotion visual odometry (MVO) pipeline requires no a priori knowledge of the environment or the dynamic objects. Its performance is evaluated on a real-world dynamic dataset with ground truth for all motions from a motion capture system.",

        "abstract": "Human detection and tracking is an essential task for service robots, where the combined use of multiple sensors has potential advantages that are yet to be fully exploited. In this paper, we introduce a framework allowing a robot to learn a new 3D LiDAR-based human classifier from other sensors over time, taking advantage of a multisensor tracking system. The main innovation is the use of different detectors for existing sensors (i.e. RGB-D camera, 2D LiDAR) to train, online, a new 3D LiDAR-based human classifier based on a new \u201ctrajectory probability\u201d. Our framework uses this probability to check whether new detection belongs to a human trajectory, estimated by different sensors and/or detectors, and to learn a human classifier in a semi-supervised fashion. The framework has been implemented and tested on a real-world dataset collected by a mobile robot. We present experiments illustrating that our system is able to effectively learn from different sensors and from the environment, and that the performance of the 3D LiDAR-based human classification improves with the number of sensors/detectors used.",

However, selective muscle activation extraction is difficult because of the complexity of muscle structures. This study investigated muscle activation source model-based sEMG signal decomposition that considers the anatomical factors of muscle structures. The main advantage of the proposed model-based signal decomposition is that sEMG interface rotation can be recognized by comparing source parameters identified before and after rotation. To assess the performance of the proposed model-based decomposition method, hand motion estimation and rotation recognition were conducted. Additionally, two-dimensional simultaneous control was conducted with an inertial measurement unit to verify the usability of the proposed model. The results indicate that the proposed model decomposes an sEMG signal based on motion with good performance and demonstrate feasibility of motion estimation independent of sEMG interface rotation.",

This interesting point encourages us to exploit its flying natural dynamics so as to control the flying robots on energy efficient and robust gaits. In doing so, we study the albatross dynamic soaring from analytical and biological perspectives and realize that to generate the dynamic soaring instead of trajectory control, the mechanical energy should be regulated. Accordingly, the control objective is set to mechanical energy regulation, and the bank angle and lift coefficient are computed to satisfy this objective. The presented method is simulated on a standard albatross model and generates two different types of dynamic soaring; O-shaped and a-shaped patterns. In addition, by means of simulations, it is investigated that the presented method is robust in face of variations in initial conditions and unexpected disturbances in the environment's model; i.e., they cannot disturb the stability and cyclic behavior of the system. Moreover, the simulation results are compared with pieces of natural evidence from albatross and interesting similarities are observed.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel concept for teach-and-repeat visual navigation. The proposed concept is based on a mathematical model, which indicates that in teach-and-repeat navigation scenarios, mobile robots do not need to perform explicit localisation. Rather than that, a mobile robot which repeats a previously taught path can simply \u201creplay\u201d the learned velocities, while using its camera information only to correct its heading relative to the intended path. To support our claim, we establish a position error model of a robot, which traverses a taught path by only correcting its heading. Then, we outline a mathematical proof which shows that this position error does not diverge over time. Based on the insights from the model, we present a simple monocular teach-and-repeat navigation method. The method is computationally efficient, it does not require camera calibration, and it can learn and autonomously traverse arbitrarily-shaped paths. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the method can reliably guide mobile robots in realistic indoor and outdoor conditions, and can cope with imperfect odometry, landmark deficiency, illumination variations and naturally-occurring environment changes.

        "abstract": "To generate dynamic motions such as hopping and running on legged robots, model-based approaches are usually used to embed the well studied spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model into the whole-body robot. In producing controlled SLIP-like behaviors, existing methods either suffer from online incompatibility or resort to classical interpolations based on lookup tables. Alternatively, this paper presents the application of a data-driven approach which obviates the need for solving the inverse of the running return map online. Specifically, a deep neural network is trained offline with a large amount of simulation data based on the SLIP model to learn its dynamics. The trained network is applied online to generate reference foot placements for the humanoid robot. The references are then mapped to the whole-body model through a QP-based inverse dynamics controller. Simulation experiments on the WALK-MAN robot are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in generating bio-inspired and robust running motions.",

        "abstract": "Motor functions of the biological system has been forged through 4 billion years evolution. From a neurorobotics view, it is important not only to know how well it works, but also how it fails. To quantitatively describe early onset symptoms of a neurodegenerative disease, we analyzed phenotypes of genetically engineered Huntington disease (HD) model mice, which reveal progressive impaired motor functions. We devised a simple yet sensitive paradigm called the crystalized motion profile (CMP), by which we successfully detected subtle difference between normal and abnormal mice in terms of whole-body level motor coordination. Our long-term objective is to remodel human mind and body to regain impaired motor and cognitive functions with ageing. To do so, we are developing a soft neurorobotic suit that provides integrated cognitive and physical interventions to users. Our analysis on the HD model mice is important as the first step to bridge between molecular mechanisms (altered genetic code) and the macroscopic neuro-musculoskeletal model. With this, we can extrapolate from knowledge of non-human mammals to human to derive the remodeling.",

        "abstract": "The present study highlights the benefits of using well-controlled experimental designs, grounded in experimental psychology research and objective neuroscientific methods, for generating progress in human-robot interaction (HRI) research. More specifically, we aimed at implementing a well-studied paradigm of attentional cueing through gaze (the so-called \u201cjoint attention\u201d or \u201cgaze cueing\u201d) in an HRI protocol involving the iCub robot. Similarly to documented results in gaze-cueing research, we found faster response times and enhanced event-related potentials of the EEG signal for discrimination of cued, relative to uncued, targets. These results are informative for the robotics community by showing that a humanoid robot with mechanistic eyes and human-like characteristics of the face is in fact capable of engaging a human in joint attention to a similar extent as another human would do. More generally, we propose that the methodology of combining neuroscience methods with an HRI protocol, contributes to understanding mechanisms of human social cognition in interactions with robots and to improving robot design, thanks to systematic and well-controlled experimentation tapping onto specific cognitive mechanisms of the human, such as joint attention.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The dynamics of quadrotors are affected by time-varying torque latency, which can greatly alter the stability robustness and performance of the closed-loop control schemes employed for flight; this issue is especially relevant during the execution of aerobatic maneuvers such as high-speed multi-flips. To address this problem, we propose two controller synthesis methods associated with two different modeling approaches. In the first approach, we describe torque latency with a linear time-invariant (LTI)model, identified through ground experiments, which is then used to design a backstepping-based nonlinear controller. In the second approach, we employ an improved linear time-varying (LTV)model with a priori unknown parameters, which is used to synthesize and implement a novel nonlinear adaptive control scheme updated in real time using the recursive least-squares (RLS)algorithm. Empirical observations suggest that the torque delay affecting the system depends on the time-varying angular speed of the flyer and its derivative. This phenomenon is explained by the fact that the aerodynamic forces produced by, and acting on, the rotating propellers vary with the local velocity of the incident flows. Hence, in the proposed adaptive structure, we define the parameters of the LTV latency model as linear functions of the angular speed reference and its derivative. Experimental results compellingly demonstrate the efficacy of the methods introduced in this paper; compared to the highperformance linear controller in [1]-[3], the backstepping-based control scheme and adaptive controller decrease the average root mean square (RMS)value of the control error by 17.82 % and 38.42 %, respectively.",

In this paper, we deepen the analysis of the mechanism of the indirectly controlled sliding locomotion for further optimization and generalization. First, we derive the equations of dynamics and control. Second, we estimate the natural frequency of the robot, the moving speed and energy efficiency are also evaluated with respect to forcing amplitude and frequency of the wobbling mass. Third, the Arnol'd tongue is introduced to analyze the relationship between achieving efficient locomotion and being entrained. In addition, phase oscillation and synchronization phenomenon are analyzed via hysteresis plot to further interpret the unusual shapes of the Arnol'd tongues. Finally, we analyze the entrained, however, inefficient locomotion by reconfirming the rolling constraints from the mechanical energy dissipation point of view. Our results help better understanding of the indirectly controlling mechanism, and the methods can be applied to other indirectly controlled locomotion robots.",

The tracker consists of two stages: the first performs a tracking-by-detection scheme on the color stream, to locate the objects on the image plane, while the second uses a particle filter that operates on the depth data stream to refine the first stage output and infer the objects' rotations. Given the six degrees-of-freedom of the assembly part poses, the system is able to recognize which connections have been completed at any given time. This information is then used to select an appropriate verbal or gestural response for the robot. Experimental results show that (a) the tracking algorithm is accurate, fast and robust to severe occlusions and fast movements, (b) the proposed method of assembly state estimation is indeed effective, and (c) the resulting Child-Robot Interaction scenario is educational and enjoyable for the children involved.",

        "abstract": "Instance-based object detection and fine pose estimation is an active research problem in computer vision. While the traditional interest-point-based approaches for pose estimation are precise, their applicability in robotic tasks relies on controlled environments and rigid objects with detailed textures. CNN-based approaches, on the other hand, have shown impressive results in uncontrolled environments for more general object recognition tasks like category-based coarse pose estimation, but the need of large datasets of fully-annotated training images makes them unfavourable for tasks like instance-based pose estimation. We present a novel approach that combines the robustness of CNNs with a fine-resolution instance-based 3D pose estimation, where the model is trained with fully-annotated synthetic training data, generated automatically from the 3D models of the objects. We propose an experimental setup in which we can carefully examine how the model trained with synthetic data performs on real images of the objects. Results show that the proposed model can be trained only with synthetic renderings of the objects' 3D models and still be successfully applied on images of the real objects, with precision suitable for robotic tasks like object grasping. Based on the results, we present more general insights about training neural models with synthetic images for application on real-world images.",

Active object sensing is used to gather time-series training and testing data. A simple feedforward, a recurrent, and a convolutional neural network are used for recognizing objects. Evaluations with different number of employed measurements, static vs. time series data and force vector vs. only normal force vector measurements show that the high-dimensional information provided by the sensors is indeed beneficial.

Obstacle detection is cast as a scene semantic segmentation problem in which pixels are assigned a probability of belonging to water or non-water regions. We extend a single-view model to a stereo system by adding a constraint which prefers consistent class labels assignment to pixels in the left and right camera images corresponding to the same parts of a 3D scene. Our approach jointly fits a semantic model to both images, leading to an improved class-label posterior map from which obstacles and water edge are extracted. In overall F-measure, our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art monocular approach by 0.495, a monocular CNN by 0.798 and their stereo extensions by 0.059 and 0.515, respectively on the task of obstacle detection while running real-time on a single CPU.",

A high level contextual understanding of the surroundings is necessary to execute accurate driving maneuvers. This paper presents a novel approach to build three dimensional semantic octree maps from lidar scans and the output of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to obtain the labels of the environment. We present a heuristic method to associate uncertainties to the labels from the images based on a combination of the labels themselves, score maps retrieved by the CNN and the raw images. These uncertainties and the camera-lidar calibration parameters for multiple cameras are considered in the projection of the labels and their uncertainties into the point cloud. Every labeled lidar scan works as an input to an octree map building algorithm that calculates and updates the label probabilities of the voxels in the map. This paper also presents a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of accuracy, analyzing projection in single lidar scans and complete maps built with our probabilistic octree framework.",

The workspace is designed for sensorless operation, using a fixed set of open-loop force-field inputs that move a polyomino from an inlet port to an outlet port that corresponds to the polyomino's shape, and reset the workspace to classify the next polyomino. This paper proves that static workspaces can classify all orthoconvex polyominoes of width w and height h, and provides a motion sequence and required size of workspace as a function of wand h. By allowing moving polyomino cams that assist in the sorting, we can design dynamic works paces that can sort all polyomi-noes that are \u201ccompletely filled\u201d using a constant number of force-field inputs. Hardware experiments using magnetic and gravity-based actuation demonstrate these static and dynamic sensorless classifiers at the millimeter scale.",

        "abstract": "Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has recently enabled humans with motor complete spinal cord injury (SCI) to independently stand and recover some lost autonomic function. However, the nature of the recovered motor activity and the interplay between SCS and motor training are not well understood. Understanding the effect of stand training and spinal stimulation on motor activity during bipedal standing is important for designing spinal rehabilitation therapies that seek to combine spinal stimulation and rehabilitative robots. In this study, we examined electromyography (EMG) data gathered from two SCI patients and six healthy subjects as they attempted standing. We analyzed the muscle activation patterns and EMG waveform shape to quantify both the changes in SCI patient motor activity with training, and the differences between healthy motor activity and SCI patient motor activity under stimulation. We also looked for correlations between the similarity in SCI patients' motor activity to healthy subjects and their overall standing ability. We found that good standing in SCI patients does not emulate healthy standing muscle activity. Furthermore, patient stand training heavily influenced motor activation patterns, but not in ways that improved standing ability. These results indicate that current training techniques do not optimally influence motor activity, and robotic rehabilitation strategies for SCI patients should target essential features of motor activity to optimize functional performance, rather than emulate healthy activity.",

Due to this hybrid mobility skill, they can excel in many application scenarios where other mobile platforms are not suitable for. However, their versatile mobility increases the number of constraints in their motion control where both the properties of legged and wheeled systems need to be considered. Relevant schemes for legged-wheeled platforms so far have been developed exploiting separate motion control of the wheeled and legged functionalities. This paper discusses the legged-wheeled motion kinematics without constraining the camber angles of the wheels, and it proposes a first-order inverse kinematics scheme that stabilizes the legged-wheeled system in the wheeled motion. Furthermore, the work adopts a floating base model that allows to easily incorporate the legged motion to the scheme. The developed controller is tested in simulation and experiments on a legged-wheeled centaur-like robot - CENTAURO.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents orientation planning algorithms respecting the requirements of task space trajectory generation, particularly in robotics applications. The proposed algorithms fulfill the following conditions: (i) permitting to impose constraints at angular velocity and acceleration in addition to orientation at endpoints; (ii) rendering continuous acceleration profiles even when interpolating multiple orientations; and (iii) being computationally fast enough for realtime implementation. The generated spline trajectories are essentially a concatenation of polynomial in time curves parameterized by quaternion coefficients. To impose the unitariness condition critically required for quaternion representation of orientation, we develop an on-line update mechanism which successively reparameterizes the polynomials constructing the spline, towards suppressing distortions that the normalization operation might incur. Experiments on an anthropomorphic robot upper-body are carried out to demonstrate the efficacy and real-time compatibility of the proposed algorithms in comparison with a standard spherical interpolation method.",

        "abstract": "Speech emotion recognition (SER) is an important aspect of effective human-robot collaboration and received a lot of attention from the research community. For example, many neural network-based architectures were proposed recently and pushed the performance to a new level. However, the applicability of such neural SER models trained only on in-domain data to noisy conditions is currently under-researched. In this work, we evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art neural acoustic emotion recognition models in human-robot interaction scenarios. We hypothesize that a robot's ego noise, room conditions, and various acoustic events that can occur in a home environment can significantly affect the performance of a model. We conduct several experiments on the iCub robot platform and propose several novel ways to reduce the gap between the model's performance during training and testing in real-world conditions. Furthermore, we observe large improvements in the model performance on the robot and demonstrate the necessity of introducing several data augmentation techniques like overlaying background noise and loudness variations to improve the robustness of the neural approaches.",

        "abstract": "This video presents a microfluidic phenomenon called \u201cVirtual Vortex Gear (VVG)\u201d and an application of it. The video contains 4 parts and is described as follows: The 1st part shows an application of VVG as a controllable valve in a micro fluidic system and the on and off of the valve are controlled by different flow speeds. The valve is turned on when the flow speed is high enough, and vice versa. The 2nd part shows the generation of VVG and its mechanism. When the flow speed, which is proportional to Reynolds Number, is gradually increased, the flow pattern evolves in the order as (1)parallel streamlines, (2)one vortex, (3)two vortices and eventually (4)three vortices including the last vortex inside the circular chamber. The evolution indicates the transmission of flow energy from the main stream to the inside of the chamber when the flow speed is over a certain range. In addition, every two adjacent vortices rotate in opposite directions which is just like a set of gears, and that is why we named it \u201cVVG\u201d. In the 3rd part, an application of VVG for chemical injection is demonstrated. A colored liquid is represented for the chemical and is surrounded by different sheath flow for the control of injection locations. It is found that only the fluid in a particular pinpoint can be injected into the target chamber. Furthermore, the complex but stable 3D flow patterns are visualized from the video. The last part of the video shows that different amount of chemical injection can be performed in different chambers along the same main stream and the distribution of the color is gradually become uniform by spontaneous diffusing.",

        "abstract": "Pushing is a common task in robotic scenarios. In real-world environments, robots need to manipulate various unknown objects without previous experience. We propose a data-driven approach for learning local inverse models of robot-object interaction for push manipulation. The robot makes observations of the object behaviour on the fly and adapts its movement direction. The proposed model is probabilistic, and we update it using maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. We test our method by pushing objects with a holonomic mobile robot base. Validation of results over a diverse object set demonstrates a high degree of robustness and a high success rate in pushing objects towards a fixed target and along a path compared to previous methods. Moreover, based on learned inverse models, the robot can learn object properties and distinguish between different object behaviours when they are pushed from different sides.",

In this work, we propose to utilize inertial data in the detection of the contact between the leg and the terrain during the stride phase of the leg. We show that relatively cheap accelerometers can be utilized to reliably detect a foot-strike, and thus allow the robot to crawl irregular terrains. The continuous data processing is compared with the interrupt mode in which data are provided only around the foot-strike event. The interrupt mode exhibits significantly better performance, and it also supports generalization of the foot-strike event detector learned from data collected in slow locomotion to faster locomotion where the signals slightly change. The proposed solution is experimentally validated using a real hexapod walking robot for which the walking speed has been improved in comparison to the previous adaptive motion gait based on a force threshold-based position controller for the foot-strike detection.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel method for selective management of muscle fatigue in human-robot co-manipulation. The proposed framework enables the detection of excessive fatigue levels of an individual muscle group while executing a certain task, and provides anticipatory robotic responses to distribute the effort among less-fatigued muscles of human arm. Our approach uses a machine learning technique to enable online predictions of muscle forces in different arm configurations and endpoint interaction forces. The estimated muscle forces are then used for the model-based estimation of muscle fatigue levels. Through optimisation, the fatigue management system can alter the task execution in a way that specific fatigued muscles are offloaded, while at the same time enables the production of task force using muscles with lower levels of fatigue. The main advantage of the proposed method is that it can operate online, and that all the measurements are performed by the robot sensory system, which can significantly increase the applicability in real-world scenarios. To validate the proposed method, we performed proof-of-concept experiments where the task of the human operator was to use a tool to polish an object that was manipulated by the robot.",

        "abstract": "How can high dimensional robots learn general sets of skills from experience in the real world? Many previous approaches focus on maximizing a single utility function and require large datasets of experience to do this, something that is not possible to collect outside of simulation as every data point is expensive both in time and in a potential wear down of the robot. This paper addresses this question using a newly developed framework called Finite Element Goal Babbling (FEGB). FEGB is an online learning method that aims at providing general control over some measurable feature, in contrast to optimizing it to some given utility function. It generalizes standard goal babbling by breaking down the full learning problem into local sub-problems, and combining it with a planner that learns how to navigate between these subproblems. We test FEGB using a real humanoid robot Nao, and find that it could quickly learn to robustly control its body orientation. After only 20-30 minutes of training, the robot could freely move into any body orientation between lying on either side and on its back. Rapid learning of body orientation control in high dimensional real robots is largely an unexplored field of robotics, and although many challenges remain, FEGB shows a feasible approach to the problem.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the path planning and coordinated control of a space robot with a manipulator for capturing a rotating large object. As the grasping point on a rotating large object is translationally moving fast, an appropriate strategy and coordinated motion control of the spacecraft base and robotic arm must be employed for approaching and tracking such a grasping point. In this paper, we propose a robust control scheme including the online path planning and compliance control for grasping such a target. The path planning is derived in a simple form that allows the desired end-effector trajectory to be easily modified in real-time using the newly updated states without complex numerical calculation. In addition, the compliance control allows the end-effector to track the planned trajectory or the moving grasping point, while using contact force feedback to reduce the end-effector position error from the grasping point when capturing the target. This end-effector motion is implemented by coordinated control on the spacecraft base and robotic arm, which can suitably alter their distribution of motion according to scenes using a weighted pseudoinverse matrix. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed path planning and compliance control.",

        "abstract": "Recently, there have been numerous advances in the development of payload and power constrained lightweight Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). As these robots aspire for highspeed autonomous flights in complex dynamic environments, robust scene understanding at long-range becomes critical. The problem is heavily characterized by either the limitations imposed by sensor capabilities for geometry-based methods, or the need for large-amounts of manually annotated training data required by data-driven methods. This motivates the need to build systems that have the capability to alleviate these problems by exploiting the complimentary strengths of both geometry and data-driven methods. In this paper, we take a step in this direction and propose a generic framework for adaptive scene segmentation using self-supervised online learning. We present this in the context of vision-based autonomous MAV flight, and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed system through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and realworld field tests.",

At the same time, because of its body complexity, there are problems in controllability. First, due to the large difference between the actual robot and its geometric model, it cannot move as intended and large internal muscle tension may emerge. Second, movements which do not appear as changes in muscle lengths may emerge, because of the muscle route changes caused by softness of body tissue. To solve these problems, we construct two models: ideal joint-muscle model and muscle-route change model, using a neural network. We initialize these models by a man-made geometric model and update them online using the sensor information of the actual robot. We validate that the tendon-driven musculoskeletal humanoid Kengoro is able to obtain a correct self-body image through several experiments.",

So far, visual sensing has been mostly used to solve this issue, but vision sensors are sensitive to occlusions, which might be inevitable when manipulating an object with robot. To address this issue, we present a modular pipeline to track the shape of a soft object in an online manner by coupling tactile sensing with a deformation model. Using a model of a tactile sensor, we compute the magnitude and location of a contact force and apply it as an external force to the deformation model. The deformation model then updates the nodal positions of a mesh that describes the shape of the deformable object. The proposed sensor model and pipeline, are evaluated using a Shadow Dexterous Hand equipped with BioTac sensors on its fingertips and an RGB-D sensor.",

        "abstract": "Accurate state estimation is a fundamental module for various intelligent applications, such as robot navigation, autonomous driving, virtual and augmented reality. Visual and inertial fusion is a popular technology for 6-DOF state estimation in recent years. Time instants at which different sensors' measurements are recorded are of crucial importance to the system's robustness and accuracy. In practice, timestamps of each sensor typically suffer from triggering and transmission delays, leading to temporal misalignment (time offsets) among different sensors. Such temporal offset dramatically influences the performance of sensor fusion. To this end, we propose an online approach for calibrating temporal offset between visual and inertial measurements. Our approach achieves temporal offset calibration by jointly optimizing time offset, camera and IMU states, as well as feature locations in a SLAM system. Furthermore, the approach is a general model, which can be easily employed in several feature-based optimization frameworks. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the high accuracy of our calibration approach even compared with other state-of-art offline tools. The VIO comparison against other methods proves that the online temporal calibration significantly benefits visual-inertial systems. The source code of temporal calibration is integrated into our public project, VINS-Mono1.",

        "abstract": "For human-robot cooperation, inferring a hu-man's cognitive state is very important for an efficient and natural interaction. Similar to human-human cooperation, understanding what the partner plans and knowing, if he is situation aware, is necessary to prevent collisions, offer support at the right time, correct mistakes before they happen or choose the best actions for oneself as early as possible. We propose a model-based belief filter to extract relevant aspects of a human's mental state online during cooperation. It performs inference based on human actions and its own task knowledge, modeling cognitive processes like perception and action selection. In contrast to most prior work, we explicitly estimate the human belief instead of inferring only a single mode or intention. Since this is a double inference process, we focus on representing the human estimates of environmental state and task as well as corresponding uncertainties. We designed a human-robot cooperation experiment that allowed for a variety of cognitive states of both agents and collected data to test and evaluate the proposed belief filter. The results are promising, as our system can be used to provide reasonable predictions of the human action and insights into his situation awareness. At the same time it is inferring interpretable information about the underlying cognitive states - A belief about the human's belief about the environment.",

        "abstract": "Fasteners assembly automation in different industries require flexible systems capable of dealing with faulty situations. Fault detection and isolation (FDI) techniques are used to detect failure and deal with them, avoiding losses on parts, tools or robots. However, FDI usually deals with the faults after or at the moment they occur. Thus, we propose a method that predicts potential failures online, based on the forces and torques signatures captured during the task. We demonstrate the approach experimentally using an industrial robot, equipped with a force-torque sensor and a pneumatic gripper, used to align and thread nuts into bolts. All effort information is fed into a supervised machine learning algorithm, based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier. The network was able to predict and classify the threading task outcomes in 3 groups: mounted, not mounted or jammed. Our approach was able to reduce in 10.9% the threading task execution time when compared to a reference without FDI, but had problem to predict jammed cases. The same experiment was also performed with other two additional learning algorithms, and the results were systematically compared.",

We show, how our knowledge based approach to end-user programming of synchronized motions and other generalizable, robot-agnostic skills can support such specification of coordinated actions between two robot arms and explain how that could be extended to include coordination with a human user. We describe the underlying ontologies and possibilities to populate those with an interface for intuitive programming, and show the generality of our approach through a task transfer between different kinematics (different robots), where the user is supported through underlying reasoning about the fulfillment of certain parameters or constraints for the involved skills.",

        "abstract": "Visually recognising a traversed route - regardless of whether seen during the day or night, in clear or inclement conditions, or in summer or winter - is an important capability for navigating robots. Since SeqSLAM was introduced in 2012, a large body of work has followed exploring how robotic systems can use the algorithm to meet the challenges posed by navigation in changing environmental conditions. The following paper describes OpenSeqSLAM2.0, a fully open-source toolbox for visual place recognition under changing conditions. Beyond the benefits of open access to the source code, OpenSeqSLAM2.0 provides a number of tools to facilitate exploration of the visual place recognition problem and interactive parameter tuning. Using the new open source platform, it is shown for the first time how comprehensive parameter characterisations provide new insights into many of the system components previously presented in ad hoc ways and provide users with a guide to what system component options should be used under what circumstances and why.",

Compared to existing methods which rely on polynomial splines or time optimal control techniques, our method systematically addresses the issue of axes-coupled and interval-wise constraints. These constraints can be used to construct safe flying zones and satisfy vehicle's physical limits. The proposed approach has also been extended to generate trajectories from the nominal plan which consists of not only points but also lines and planes, opening a door for new improvements and applications. Moreover, a closed-form solution can be obtained for cases without inequality constraints. Such a solution is numerically stable for the large-scale fitting problem, which allows us to directly fit the human sketching input from the touch device and capture all subtle details. Our approach is verified by various real flight experiments..",

Thus far, it has been reported that these robots can achieve high adaptability to environments despite their extremely simple controllers. However, because these robots are difficult to model mathematically, there is still no systematic design policy, in which control theory has been playing a role in conventional robotics, for constituting simple controllers. To tackle this problem, we propose a new approach using a neural network to obtain mathematical models. In particular, with this method, the control theory is applied to linear system models extracted from a network trained to express the forward dynamics of a robot. Through simulations, the validity and advantage of the proposed method was successfully confirmed.",

        "abstract": "Precisely manipulating the center of mass (CoM) of the underactuated locomotion robot can't be easily achieved by common control mechanisms which apply only joint torques. A novel and indirect method has been recently introduced using an active wobbling mass attached to limit cycle walkers. The next important issue is to design an optimal control input to reduce the forcing energy. In this paper, we use combined rimless wheels as a simplified example to apply our method, which is based on the theory of phase oscillators. First, we introduce the typical modeling and control of this underactuated robot. Second, we obtain the phase response curve by numerically applying perturbations at different phases of the walker's gait interval and calculating the deviations from the unperturbed. Third, we analytically derive an optimal forcing waveform for the wobbling mass to entrain the combined rimless wheel based on the phase response curve. As an ecological extension, an ideal forcing waveform for m: 1 entrainment was further generated. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated by locking range of the Arnold tongues. The results show that the optimal forcing waveform we derived achieves the best performance for 1:1 entrainment among all the candidates. One of the strongest advantages of our method is the easiness of its implementation, prompting its applicability to a wide variety of locomotion systems.",

This problem is relevant in numerous scenarios where humans and robots are jointly deployed for tasks like urban search and rescue, surveillance, and the like. In this case, as the humans move in the environment, connectivity may be broken, and consequently, robots need to reposition themselves to restore it. We study the computational complexity of the problem, also in terms of approximation hardness, and present an Integer Linear Programming formulation to compute optimal solutions. We then analyze the performance of the proposed resolution approach against a heuristic algorithm taken from the literature, and we demonstrate how our method favorably compares in terms of solution quality and scalability.",

Using this method, we can generate minimum-time piecewise polynomial trajectories for quadrotor flights. We decouple the quadrotor trajectory generation problem into two folds. Firstly we generate a smooth and safe curve which is parameterized by a virtual variable. This curve named spatial trajectory is independent of time and has fixed spatial properties. Then a mapping function which decides how the quadrotor moves along the spatial trajectory respecting kinodynamic limits is found by minimizing total trajectory time. The mapping function maps the virtual variable to time is named temporal trajectory. We formulate the minimum-time temporal trajectory generation problem as a convex program which can be efficiently solved. We show that the proposed method can corporate with various types of previous trajectory generation method to obtain the optimal time allocation. The proposed method is integrated into a customized light-weight quadrotor platform and is validated by presenting autonomous flights in indoor and outdoor environments. We release our code for time optimization as an open-source ros-package.",

        "abstract": "Robustness of indirect SLAM techniques to light changing conditions remains a central issue in the robotics community. With the change in the illumination of a scene, feature points are either not extracted properly due to low contrasts, or not matched due to large differences in descriptors. In this paper, we propose a multi-layered image representation (MLI) in which each layer holds a contrast enhanced version of the current image in the tracking process in order to improve detection and matching. We show how Mutual Information can be used to compute dynamic contrast enhancements on each layer. We demonstrate how this approach dramatically improves the robustness in dynamic light changing conditions on both synthetic and real environments compared to default ORB-SLAM. This work focalises on the specific case of SLAM relocalisation in which a first pass on a reference video constructs a map, and a second pass with a light changed condition relocalizes the camera in the map.",

        "abstract": "Current ergonomic assessment procedures require observation and manual annotation of postures by an expert, after which ergonomic scores are inferred from these annotations. Our aim is to automate this procedure and to enable robots to optimize their behavior with respect to such scores. A particular challenge is that ergonomic scoring requires accurate biomechanical simulations which are computationally too expensive to use in robot control loops or optimization. To address this, we learn Contextual Ergonomics Models, which are Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models that have been trained with full musculoskeletal simulations for specific tasks contexts. Contextual Ergonomics Models enable search in a low-dimensional latent space, whilst the cost function can be defined in terms of the full high-dimensional musculoskeletal model, which can be quickly reconstructed from the latent space. We demonstrate how optimizing Contextual Ergonomics Models leads to significantly reduced muscle activation in an experiment with eight subjects performing a drilling task.",

        "abstract": "Multi-beam lidar (MBL) scanners are compact, light, and accessible 3D sensors with high data rates, but they offer limited vertical resolution and field of view (FOV). Some recent robotics research has profited from the addition of a degree-of-freedom (DOF) to an MBL to build rotating multibeam lidars (RMBL) that can achieve high-resolution scans with full spherical FOV. In a previous work, we offered a methodology to analyze the complex 3D scan measurement distributions produced by RMBLs with a rolling DOF and no pitching. In this paper, we investigate the effect of introducing constant pitch angles in the construction of the RMBLs with the purpose of finding a kinematic configuration that optimizes scan homogeneity with a spherical FOV. To this end, we propose a scalar index of 3D sensor homogeneity that is based on the spherical formulation of Ripley's K function. The optimization is performed for the widely used Puck (VLP-16) and HDL-32 sensors by Velodyne.",

        "abstract": "In many robotics tasks successful execution requires high precision pose estimates of the objects in the workcell. When the object pose is provided by a computer vision system it is therefore crucial that the vision system is configured such that the required precision is achieved. An important part of the configuration is the sensor placement, however, most work in the field of sensor placement does not take the random, semi-constrained nature of the initial object pose into account. This paper presents a framework which uses an analysis of object stable poses together with dynamic simulation to predict the probability distribution of initial object poses. The framework is highly modular and uses precomputed pose uncertainties and a mixture model to make the integration over all possible stable poses feasible. This makes the framework applicable to a wide range of sensors and uncertainty models. The framework is evaluated in simulation for a concrete example: A single PrimeSense Carmine to be placed at an optimal elevation angle in a table picking scenario where pose uncertainties are modeled using Gaussians.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel method to enable fast autonomous flight in cluttered environments. Typically, autonomous navigation through a complex environment requires a continuous heuristic search on a graph generated by a k-connected grid or a probabilistic scheme. As the vehicle progresses, modification of the graph with data from onboard sensors is expensive as is search on the graph, especially if the paths must be kino-dynamically feasible. We suggest that computation needed to find safe paths during fast flight can be greatly reduced if we precompute and carefully arrange a dense set of alternative paths before the flight. Any prior map information can be used to prune the alternative paths to come up with a data structure that enables very fast online computation to deal with obstacles that are not on the map but only detected by onboard sensors. To test this idea, we have conducted a large number of flight experiments in structured (large industrial facilities) and unstructured (forests-like) environments. We show that even in the most unstructured environments, this method enables flight at a speed up to 10m/s while avoiding obstacles detected from onboard sensors.",

        "abstract": "We present the first perception-aware model predictive control framework for quadrotors that unifies control and planning with respect to action and perception objectives. Our framework leverages numerical optimization to compute trajectories that satisfy the system dynamics and require control inputs within the limits of the platform. Simultaneously, it optimizes perception objectives for robust and reliable sensing by maximizing the visibility of a point of interest and minimizing its velocity in the image plane. Considering both perception and action objectives for motion planning and control is challenging due to the possible conflicts arising from their respective requirements. For example, for a quadrotor to track a reference trajectory, it needs to rotate to align its thrust with the direction of the desired acceleration. However, the perception objective might require to minimize such rotation to maximize the visibility of a point of interest. A model-based optimization framework, able to consider both perception and action objectives and couple them through the system dynamics, is therefore necessary. Our perception-aware model predictive control framework works in a receding-horizon fashion by iteratively solving a non-linear optimization problem. It is capable of running in real-time, fully onboard our lightweight, small-scale quadrotor using a low-power ARM computer, together with a visual-inertial odometry pipeline. We validate our approach in experiments demonstrating (I) the conflict between perception and action objectives, and (II) improved behavior in extremely challenging lighting conditions.",

        "abstract": "Point cloud registration is a popular research topic and has been widely used in many tasks, such as robot mapping and localization. It is a challenging problem when the overlap is small, or the rotation is large. The problem has not been well solved by existing methods such as the iterative closest point (ICP) and its variants. In this paper, a novel method named principal coordinate alignment with overlap tuning (PCAOT) is proposed based on the Manhattan world assumption. It solves two key problems together, the transformation estimation and the overlap estimation. The overlap is represented by a 3D cuboid and the transformation is computed only within the overlap region. Instead of finding point correspondence as in traditional methods, we estimate the rotation by principal coordinates alignment, which is faster and less sensitive than ICP and its variants to small overlaps and large rotations. Evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves much better results than the ICP and its variants when the overlap ratio is smaller than 50%, or the rotation angle is larger than 60\u00b0. Especially, it is effective when the overlap ratio is less than 30%, or the rotation angle is larger than 90\u00b0.",

        "abstract": "Many robotics applications involve navigating to positions specified in terms of their semantic significance. A robot operating in a hotel may need to deliver room service to a named room. In a hospital, it may need to deliver medication to a patient's room. The Building-Wide Intelligence Project at UT Austin has been developing a fleet of autonomous mobile robots, called BWIBots, which perform tasks in the computer science department. Tasks include guiding a person, delivering a message, or bringing an object to a location such as an office, lecture hall, or classroom. The process of constructing a map that a robot can use for navigation has been simplified by modern SLAM algorithms. The attachment of semantics to map data, however, remains a tedious manual process of labeling locations in otherwise automatically generated maps.

The main challenge is the absence of actuation along body-planar directions of the aerial vehicle which might be required during the interaction to preserve passivity. The controller proposed in this paper guarantees passivity of the manipulator through a proper choice of end-effector coordinates, and that of vehicle fuselage is guaranteed by exploiting time domain passivity technique. Simulation studies validate the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) pose significant communication challenges: vehicles are submerged for periods of time in which speed-of-light communication is impossible. This is a particular problem on low-cost AUV platforms, on which acoustic modems are not available to get vehicle state or provide re-deploy commands. We investigate one possible method of providing operators with a communication line to these vehicles by using noise underwater to both classify behavior of submerged vehicles and to command them. In this scheme, processing of data from hydrophone arrays provide operators with AUV mode estimates and AUVs with surface vehicle behavior updates. Simulation studies were used to characterize trajectories for simple transect versus loiter behaviors based on the bearing and time to intercept (TTI). A classifier based on K-nearest-neighbor with dynamic time warping as a distance metric was used to classify simulation data. The simulation-based classifier was then applied to classify bearing tracking data from passive tracking of a loitering AUV and bearing and TTI data from passive tracking of a transecting boat based on field array data. Experiment data was classified with 76 % accuracy using bearing-only data, 96% accuracy for TTI -only data and 99 % accuracy for combined classification. The techniques developed here could be used for AUV cuing by surface vessels and monitoring of AUV behavior.",

        "abstract": "Encoding desired motions into dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) is a common way for generating compact task representations that are able to handle sensor-based goal adaptations. At the same time, a robot should not only express adaptive motion capabilities at planning level, but use also contact wrench feedback in the adaptation and learning process of the DMP. Despite first approaches exist in this direction, no fully integrated approach has been proposed so far. In this paper, we introduce a new class of admittance-coupled DMPs that addresses environmental changes by including contact wrench feedback dynamics into the DMP formalism. Moreover, a novel iterative learning approach is devised that is based on monitoring the overall system passivity analysis in terms of reference power tracking. Simulations and experimental results with the Kuka LWR robot maintaining a non-rigid contact with the environment (wiping a surface) are shown for supporting the validity of our approach.",

Synthesizing controllers to \u201crobustly\u201d follow a reference trajectory is a fundamental problem for autonomous vehicles. Robustness, in this context, requires our controllers to handle a specified amount of deviation from the desired trajectory. Our approach considers a timing law that describes how fast to move along a given reference trajectory and a control feedback law for reducing deviations from the reference. We synthesize both feedback laws using \u201ccontrol funnel functions\u201d that jointly encode the control law as well as its correctness argument over a mathematical model of the vehicle dynamics. We adapt a previously described demonstration-based learning algorithm to synthesize a control funnel function as well as the associated feedback law. We implement this law on top of a 1/8th scale autonomous vehicle called the Parkour car. We compare the performance of our path following approach against a trajectory tracking approach by specifying trajectories of varying lengths and curvatures. Our experiments demonstrate the improved robustness obtained from the use of control funnel functions.",

        "abstract": "Despite growing attention in autonomy, there are still many open problems, including how autonomous vehicles will interact and communicate with other agents, such as human drivers and pedestrians. Unlike most approaches that focus on pedestrian detection and planning for collision avoidance, this paper considers modeling the interaction between human drivers and pedestrians and how it might influence map estimation, as a proxy for detection. We take a mapping inspired approach and incorporate people as sensors into mapping frameworks. By taking advantage of other agents' actions, we demonstrate how we can impute portions of the map that would otherwise be occluded. We evaluate our framework in human driving experiments and on real-world data, using occupancy grids and landmark-based mapping approaches. Our approach significantly improves overall environment awareness and outperforms standard mapping techniques.",

        "abstract": "In order to accurately reach a target position while executing a task which imposes occlusion or constraints of the posture, a humanoid robot requires an adaptive locomotion system, which can comprehensively integrate localization, environmental mapping, global locomotion planning and local error correction. In this paper, we propose a method of constructing a perception based locomotion system for a humanoid robot. The major contribution of this paper is solving a problem of the locomotion error caused by the task constraints, by locally compensating footsteps and assessing the need for global footstep re-planning online based on environmental measurements. The proposed system provides an accurate and dense ground point cloud, called HeightField, using plane estimation and space interpolation, and obstacle point cloud for frequent collision avoidance by accumulating laser scans. This environmental perception enables a humanoid robot to plan footsteps globally even in the situation where the sight of the robot is limited and compensate footsteps while estimating landing state during locomotion online with the localization result. We evaluated the practicality of the proposed system by applying it to our humanoid robot carrying a heavy object in a construction site and confirmed that the proposed system contributed to improved locomotion abilities of a humanoid robot engaging in heavy-duty or dangerous tasks.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Most existing motion planning algorithms assume that a map (of some quality) is fully determined prior to generating a motion plan. In many emerging applications of robotics, e.g., fast-moving agile aerial robots with constrained embedded computational platforms and visual sensors, dense maps of the world are not immediately available, and they are computationally expensive to construct. We propose a new algorithm for generating plan graphs which couples the perception and motion planning processes for computational efficiency. In a nutshell, the proposed algorithm iteratively switches between the planning sub-problem and the mapping sub-problem, each updating based on the other until a valid trajectory is found. The resulting trajectory retains a provable property of providing an optimal trajectory with respect to the full (unmapped) environment, while utilizing only a fraction of the sensing data in computational experiments.",

        "abstract": "The direct kinematics problem of the Stewart-Gough platform can be solved by measuring the manipulator platform's orientation and two of the linear actuators' orientations instead of the six linear actuators' lengths. In this paper, the effect of measurement errors on the calculated manipulator platform's pose is investigated using the Cramer-Ran lower bound and extensive experiments on a state-of-the-art Stewart-Gough platform. Furthermore, different algorithms and filters for one-time as well as continuous pose determinations are investigated. Finally, possible sensor fusion concepts for the one-time pose determination are presented to increase the robustness against noise and measurement errors.",

Our approach is based on a Random Forest classifier that can be trained incrementally. This has the major benefit that semantic information from new data samples can be incorporated without retraining the entire model. Even if new samples from a previously unseen class are presented, our method is able to perform efficient updates and learn a sustainable representation for this new class. Further features of our method include a very fast and memory-efficient implementation, as well as the ability to interrupt the learning process at any time without a significant performance degradation. Experiments on benchmark data for robotic applications show the clear benefits of our incremental approach and its competitiveness with standard offline methods in terms of classification accuracy.",

In this work, we consider a heterogeneous team of aerial and ground robots that are tasked with monitoring a terrain along a given path. Both types of robots are equipped with cameras that can monitor the terrain within their fields-of-view. We also consider the ability of the aerial robots to land occasionally on the terrain to recharge. The objective is to find a path for all the robots to reduce the time required. Determining optimal routes for the robots is a challenging problem because of constrained visibility due to the terrain and fuel limitations of the robots. We devise an MILP formulation for the problem using a 1.5 dimensional representation model. A branch-and-cut framework is used to implement the MILP and involves the design of a separation algorithm to compute valid inequalities. We report results from extensive simulations and proof-of-concept field experiments to show the efficacy of our approach.",

In a period of three months, data from five different persons driving the robotic PMV in an outdoor environment while facing pedestrians were collected. 2465 clean tracks around the vehicle together with PMVs trajectories were collected. We performed an analysis of the parameters involved for human-driven smooth navigation. Relevant parameters regarding PMV-Human interaction included distance to moving objects, passing side and velocities. Moreover, data suggests the existence of a social navigational distance for the PWv. For autonomous navigation we implemented a Frenet planner to achieve safe and smooth navigation for the passenger and pedestrians around. Experimental results in real pedestrian paths show that the PMV is capable of smoothly following its path while facing pedestrians and bicycles.",

In this device, each pixel is capable of storing data and performing computation, enabling a variety of computer vision tasks to be carried out directly upon the sensor itself. In this work the PPA performs HDR edge detection, perspective correction and image alignment based odometry, allowing the position and heading of a MAV to be tracked at several hundred frames per second. We evaluate our PPA based approach by direct comparison with a motion capture system for a variety of trajectories. These include rapid accelerations that would incur significant motion blur at low frame rates, and lighting conditions that would typically lead to under or over exposure of image detail. Such challenging conditions would often lead to unusable images when relying on traditional image sensors.",

        "abstract": "The use of robots, as a social stimulus, provides several advantages over using another animal. In particular, for rat-robot studies, robots can produce social behaviour that is reproducible across trials. In the current work, we outline a framework for rat-robot interaction studies, that consists of a novel rat-sized robot (PiRat), models of robotic behavior, and a position tracking system for both robot and rat. We present the design of the framework, including constraints on autonomy, latency, and control. We pilot tested our framework by individually running the robot rat with eight different rats, first through a habituation stage, and then with PiRat performing two different types of behaviour - avoiding and frequently approaching. We evaluate the performance of the framework on latency and autonomy, and on the ability to influence the behaviour of individual rats. We find that the framework performs well on its constraints, engages some of the rats (according to the number of meetings), and features a control scheme that produces reproducible behaviour in rats. These features represent a first demonstration of a closed-loop rat-robot framework.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of obtaining human-like motions on hand-arm robotic systems performing grasping actions. The focus is set on the coordinated movements of the robotic arm and the anthropomorphic mechanical hand, with which the arm is equipped. For this, human movements performing different grasps are captured and mapped to the robot in order to compute the human hand synergies. These synergies are used to both obtain human-like movements and to reduce the complexity of the planning phase by reducing the dimension of the search space. In addition, the paper proposes a sampling-based planner, which guides the motion planning following the synergies and considering different types of grasps. The introduced approach is tested in an application example and thoroughly compared with a state-of-the-art planning algorithm, obtaining better results.",

        "abstract": "The ability to move around the environment is one of the most important capabilities of a mobile robot. Although navigation is considered an already achieved capacity, there is still much work to be done to integrate navigation with high level reasoning and acting. Navigate in indoor environments also involve complex actions, such as opening doors, use elevators, and many others. We propose a topological navigation system based on Artificial Intelligence (AI)Planning. Starting from a symbolic representation of the environment, navigation tasks are divided into phases, in which different actions are required. This approach has demonstrated to be very effective to plan the operations of a robot at indoor environments. The final result is method compact, efficient and scalable. Our system has been successfully tested at European Robotics League in the humanoid robot Pepper.",

Translucency poses several open challenges in the form of transparent objects (e.g., drinking glasses), refractive media (e.g., water), and diffuse partial occlusions (e.g., objects behind stained glass panels). This paper presents Plenoptic Monte Carlo Localization (PMCL)as a method for localizing object poses in the presence of translucency using plenoptic (light-field)observations. We propose a new depth descriptor, the Depth Likelihood Volume (DLV), and its use within a Monte Carlo object localization algorithm. We present results of localizing and manipulating objects with translucent materials and objects occluded by layers of translucency. Our PMCL implementation uses observations from a Lytro first generation light field camera to allow a Michigan Progress Fetch robot to perform grasping.",

        "abstract": "Indoor localization is critical to many location-aware applications, however, a low-cost solution with guaranteed accuracies has not yet come. Visible Light Communication (VLC-) based localization techniques are very promising to fill this gap. In this paper, we propose Plugo, a novel VLC system with random multiple access towards low-cost indoor localization. Compared to conventional RF-based approaches that rely on dedicated wireless access points as location beacons, the proposed system has the potential to deliver better accuracies with reduced cost. Specifically, we build a handful of compact VLC-compatible LED bulbs out of low-cost offthe-shelf components (around $10 total cost for each assembly) and recover VLC signals using a cheap photodiode receiver. The basic framed slotted Additive Links On-line Hawaii Area (ALOHA) is exploited to achieve random multiple access over the shared optical medium. We show its effectiveness in beacon broadcasting by experiments, and further, demonstrate a preliminary localization result with sound accuracy by using fingerprinting-based methods in a customized testbed.",

        "abstract": "Skin impedance should be minimized to obtain reliable and precise surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. High skin impedance decreases sensitivity to muscular activation and makes sEMG signals vulnerable to external noise. Microneedle-based electrodes have been proposed to achieve low skin impedance and high spatial resolution. However, unstable skin contact can occur during dynamic motion due to the electrodes small contact area, and the signal is easily influenced by motion artifacts. In this study, a pneumatic microneedle-based high-density sEMG sleeve is proposed that guarantees stable sEMG signal measurement by pressing the electrodes to the skin. Pneumatic air control, sEMG signal processing, and wireless signal transmission are processed in a single processor. The proposed interface automatically controls the air volume according to sEMG signal quality and is comfortable for users. The usability of the proposed interface was compared to conventional Velcro armbands by examining acquired sEMG signals. The results indicated that the proposed pneumatic sleeve guarantees reliable sEMG signal measurement during dynamic motion. Additionally, optimal pneumatic pressure and needle length were investigated.",

        "abstract": "Robots deployed for long periods of time need to be able to explore and learn from their environment. One approach to this problem has been reinforcement learning (RL), in which robots receive rewards from the environment that allow them to choose optimal actions. To speed learning when human supervision is available, interactive reinforcement learning solicits feedback from a human teacher. However, this approach typically assumes that learning takes place under continuous supervision, which is unlikely to hold in long-term scenarios. We propose an extension to a method of interactive reinforcement learning, policy shaping, that takes into account human attention. Our approach enables better performance while unattended by favoring information-gathering actions when attended and actions that have received positive feedback when unattended. We test our approach in both simulation and on a robot, finding that our method learns faster than policy shaping and performs more safely than policy shaping while no one is paying attention to the robot.",

        "abstract": "Characterisation of nuclear environments is critical for long term operation and decommissioning. Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) is an example of a scientific instrument that could be deployed to aid in characterisation of unknown environments. LIBS consists of a high intensity pulsed laser being focussed down onto a target to create a plasma, and optical emission from the plasma is then used to determine elemental composition of unknown materials. For robots deployed with these instruments in extreme environments, mission time can be limited by hazards present such as radiation. Once deployed a robot must be able to collect the best data possible whilst maximising operational runtime. We present a data quality based probabilistic approach to robot pose estimation to maximise data quality, by considering optimum sensor placement whilst avoiding harmful environmental features such as radiation for a fixed-focus laser diagnostic such as LIBS. This approach is able to determine optimum robot poses for arbitrary targets in 3D for arbitrary diagnostic mounting with respect to the robot. The approach is able to avoid obstacles and avoid occlusion of the target by said obstacles. This can be used as part of autonomous investigation and characterisation performed by mobile robots in hazardous environments.",

        "abstract": "Pose estimation is a widely explored problem, enabling many robotic tasks such as grasping and manipulation. In this paper, we tackle the problem of pose estimation for objects that exhibit rotational symmetry, which are common in man-made and industrial environments. In particular, our aim is to infer poses for objects not seen at training time, but for which their 3D CAD models are available at test time. Previous work has tackled this problem by learning to compare captured views of real objects with the rendered views of their 3D CAD models, by embedding them in a joint latent space using neural networks. We show that sidestepping the issue of symmetry in this scenario during training leads to poor performance at test time. We propose a model that reasons about rotational symmetry during training by having access to only a small set of symmetry-labeled objects, whereby exploiting a large collection of unlabeled CAD models. We demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms a naively trained neural network on a new pose dataset containing images of tools and hardware.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Reliable long-term localization is key for robotic systems in dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for long-term localization using 3D LiDARs, coined PoseMap. In essence, we extract distinctive features from range measurements and bundle these into local views along with observation poses. The sensor's trajectory is then estimated in a sliding window fashion by matching current and old features and minimizing the distances in-between. The map representation facilitates finding a suitable set of old features, by selecting the closest local map(s) for matching. Similarly to a visibility analysis, this procedure provides a suitable set of features for localization but at a fraction of the computational cost. PoseMap also allows for updates and extensions of the map at any time by replacing and adding local maps when necessary. We evaluate our approach using two platforms both equipped with a 3D LiDAR and an IMU, demonstrating localization at 8 Hz and robustness to changes in the environment such as moving vehicles and changing vegetation. PoseMap was implemented on an autonomous vehicle allowing it to drive autonomously over a period of 18 months through a mix of industrial and unstructured off-road environments, covering more than 100 kms without a single localization failure.",

Our formulation represents the configuration of the articulated body using position variables and then uses those variables to model the friction forces between the articulated body and the environment. Our approach corresponds to a Newton-type optimization scheme that is guaranteed to converge so that it is stable with large timestep sizes. We evaluate the accuracy and stability of our time-integrator by comparing it with a conventional formulations based on the Newton-Euler equation and demonstrate the benefits on standard controller-optimization applications. We achieve 3-5 times speedup over a Newton-Euler-based simulator on a CPU. Our approach can be easily parallelized on a GPU and results in additional 4-15 times performance improvement.",

The UHP rehabilitation robot is a multifunctional device that allows to execute robotized therapies for the upper-limb using a simple pantograph based reconfigurable structure and the implementation of advanced position/force control approaches. However, in applications such as rehabilitation, where the robotic device interacts directly with the user, complying with the demands of the users is as important as complying with the functional requirements. Otherwise, the patient will reject the robotic device. Therefore, in this work the pre-clinical validation of the UHP upper-limb rehabilitation robotic platform is presented. 25 subjects of different physical characteristics have participated in the evaluation of the device, evaluating not only the correct behaviour of the device, but also its safety and adaptativity. Results show the correct behaviour of the platform, and a good acceptance rate of the device.",

        "abstract": "The future of automated driving in urban areas will most probably rely on highly accurate road maps. However, the necessary precision of a localization in such maps has so far only been reached using extra, sensor specific feature layers for localization. In this paper we want to show that it is possible to achieve sufficient accuracy without a separate localization layer. Instead, elements are used that are already contained in high-resolution road maps, such as markings and road borders. For this, we introduce a modular approach in which detections from different detection algorithms are associated with elements in the map and then fused to an absolute pose using an Unscented Kalman Filter. We evaluate our approach using a sensor setup that employs a stereo camera, vehicle odometry and a low-cost GNSS module on a 5km test route covering both narrow urban roads and multi-lane main roads under varying weather conditions. The results show that this approach is capable to be used for highly automated driving, showing an accuracy of 0.08m in typical road scenarios and a is available 98% of the time.",

        "abstract": "We developed a deadbeat foot placement hopping controller for an untethered monopedal robot, Salto-1P. The controller uses a third order Taylor series approximation to an offline dynamic model and performs well on the physical platform. The robot demonstrated precise foot placement even on trajectories with aggressive changes in speed, direction, and height: in a random walk, its error standard deviation was 0.10 m. We establish how foot placement precision is tightly limited by attitude control accuracy, requiring attitude error less than 0.7 degrees for some tasks. We also show how foot placement precision degrades linearly as hopping height increases. These precision results apply to the large class of controllers that prescribe touchdown angle to control running velocity.",

        "abstract": "Robust online incremental SLAM applications require metrics to evaluate the impact of current measurements. Despite its prevalence in graph pruning, information-theoretic metrics solely are insufficient to detect outliers. The optimal value of the objective function is a better choice to detect outliers but cannot be computed unless the problem is solved. In this paper, we show how the objective function change can be predicted in an incremental pose-graph optimization scheme, without actually solving the problem. The predicted objective function change can be used to guide online decisions or detect outliers. Experiments validate the accuracy of the predicted objective function, and an application to outlier detection is also provided, showing its advantages over M-estimators.",

This system was developed with the application of model-based tracking in mind, particularly in the case of autonomous inspection robots, where only partial views of the object are available. Out-of-view prediction is enabled by applying scaling to the feature point labels during network training. This is combined with a recurrent neural network architecture designed to provide the final prediction layers with rich feature information from across the spatial extent of the input image. To show the versatility of these out-of-view predictions, we describe how to integrate them in both a particle filter tracker and an optimisation based tracker. To evaluate our work we compared our framework with one that predicts only points inside the image. We show that as the amount of the object in view decreases, being able to predict outside the image bounds adds robustness to the final pose estimation.",

This set of information is known as affordance of the object. Affordances are generally defined by the geometrical structures and physical properties of the objects. In this paper, we present an affordance detection network (ADNet) for detecting object affordances using multimodal input i.e., RGB-D data. The method is based on the state-of-the-art fully convolutional network with two encoding streams and one decoding stream. In the presented formulation, the network learns powerful discriminative features independently from the RGB and depth images, which enables it to abstract rich photometrical and geometrical properties of the objects. The multimodal encoding is combined at multiple stages of the network using the late-fusion strategy and used is for predicting the potential affordances of the objects.",

To address this problem, here we present a novel prediction algorithm for manipulation action classes in video sequences. Manipulations are first represented using the Enriched Semantic Event Chain (ESEC) framework. This creates a temporal sequence of static and dynamic spatial relations between the objects that take part in the manipulation by which an action can be quickly recognized. We measured performance on 32 ideal as well as real manipulations and compared our method also against a state of the art trajectory-based HMM method for action recognition. We observe that manipulations can be correctly predicted after only (on average) 45% of action's total time and that we are almost twice as fast as the HMM-based method. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of this framework in a simple robot demonstration comparing two different approaches.",

        "abstract": "Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) aims to develop robots that provide assistance to human workers while performing physical tasks. Such assistance comes in the form of supportive behaviors that are different from the actions part of the task, and that are meant to help a human worker more effectively accomplish the task. Learning how to provide useful behaviors that are tailored to a human peer represents a difficult challenge. This is due to the need of large amounts of training data in the form of real world observations that include information about such preferences. This data needs to encode not only the structure and progression of the task, but also the different workers' preferences with respect to when and what assistance the robot should provide. Our work separates the challenge of learning a model of the task (which requires a large amount of training data) from that of learning supportive behavior preferences for the interaction (which has obvious restrictions for the number of user-provided demonstrations to which we have access). We first learn a hidden Markov model (HMM) from a training set consisting of observed human workers performing the considered task in simulation. We then use this model to predict, while observing the human peer, what supportive behaviors a robot should offer throughout the task. Building upon the hidden state representation, our system is able to learn the supportive behaviors based on as few as five user-annotated demonstrations, learning a personalized supportive behavior model. We evaluate our system on a user study with 14 participants, and show results on par with human-level prediction for the task.",

This paper further reports the application of the identified plant models in combined underwater communication and navigation (cooperative navigation) of UVs. We report an approach to model identification that simultaneously identifies 6-DOF UV nonlinear plant-model parameters, control-surface parameters, and thruster-model parameters. We believe this approach is suitable for identifying plant model parameters from data obtained in full-scale experimental trials of UVs in controlled motion. The reported approach to nonlinear model identification of UVs is evaluated in simulation studies. The resulting identified UV plant models are further evaluated in simulated cooperative navigation missions of the UV that are representative of high-precision survey missions.

The proposed method considers interactions that will be experienced by an autonomous surface vessel (ASV) in an environment governed by the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea (COLREGs). Our approach aims at encouraging dynamic obstacles to cooperate according to COLREGs. Therefore, we propose a strategy for assessing the cooperative behavior of obstacles, and the result of the assessment is used to adapt collision avoidance decisions within the Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (RVO) framework. Moreover, we propose a predictive approach to solving known limitations of the RVO framework, and we present computationally feasible extensions that enable the use of complex dynamic models and objectives suitable for ASVs. We demonstrate the performance and potentials of our method through a simulation study, and the results show that the proposed method leads to proactive and more predictable ASV behavior compared with both Velocity Obstacles (VO) and RVO, especially when obstacles cooperate by following COLREGs.",

        "abstract": "Successful human-robot collaboration depends on a shared understanding of task state and current goals. In nonlinear or freeform tasks without an explicit task model, robot partners are unable to provide assistance without the ability to translate perception into meaningful task knowledge. In this paper, we explore the utility of multimodal recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM) units for real-time subtask recognition in order to provide context-aware assistance during generic assembly tasks. We train RNNs to recognize specific subtasks in individual modalities, then combine the high-level representations of these networks through a nonlinear connection layer to create a multimodal subtask recognition system. We report results from implementing the system on a robot that uses the subtask recognition system to provide predictive assistance to a human partner during a laboratory experiment involving a human-robot team completing an assembly task. Generalizability of the system is evaluated through training and testing on separate tasks with some similar subtasks. Our results demonstrate the value of such a system in providing assistance to human partners during a freeform assembly scenario and increasing humans' perception of the robot's agency and usefulness.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a probabilistic collision threat assessment algorithm for autonomous driving at road intersections that assesses a given traffic situation at an intersection reliably and robustly for an autonomous vehicle to cross the intersection safely, even in the face of violation vehicles (that is, vehicles in violation of traffic rules at the intersection). To this end, the proposed algorithm employs a detailed digital map to predict future paths of observed vehicles and then utilizes the predicted future paths to identify potential threats (vehicles) and potential collision areas, regardless of whether observed vehicles are obeying traffic rules at the intersection. Next, by means of Bayesian networks and time window filtering under an independent and distributed reasoning structure, it assesses the potential threats regarding the possibility of collision reliably and robustly, even under uncertain and incomplete noise data. Then, it has been tested and evaluated through in-vehicle testing on a closed urban test road under traffic conditions inclusive of non-violation and violation vehicles. In-vehicle testing results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is sufficiently reliable to be used in decision-making for autonomous driving at intersections in terms of reliability and robustness, even in the face of violation vehicles.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a probabilistic approach for online dense reconstruction using a single monocular camera moving through the environment. Compared to spatial stereo, depth estimation from motion stereo is challenging due to insufficient parallaxes, visual scale changes, pose errors, etc. We utilize both the spatial and temporal correlations of consecutive depth estimates to increase the robustness and accuracy of monocular depth estimation. An online, recursive, probabilistic scheme to compute depth estimates, with corresponding covariances and inlier probability expectations, is proposed in this work. We integrate the obtained depth hypotheses into dense 3D models in an uncertainty-aware way. We show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach by comparing it with state-of-the-art methods in the TUM RGB-D SLAM & ICL-NUIM dataset. Online indoor and outdoor experiments are also presented for performance demonstration.",

        "abstract": "Kinematics-based collision detection is important for robot motion planning in unstructured terrain. Especially, planetary rovers require such capability as a single collision may lead to the termination of a mission. For onboard computation, typical numeric approaches are unsuitable as they are computationally expensive and unstable on rocky terrain; instead, a light-weight analytic solution (ACE: Approximate Clearance Evaluation) is planning to be used for the Mars 2020 rover mission. ACE computes the state bounds of articulated suspension systems from terrain height bounds, and assess the safety by checking the constraint violation of states with the worst-case values. ACE's conservative safety check approach can sometimes lead to over-pessimism: feasible states are often reported as infeasible, thus resulting in frequent false positive detection. In this paper, we introduce a computationally efficient probabilistic variant of ACE (called p-ACE) which estimates the probability distributions of states in real time. The advantage of having probability distributions over states, instead of deterministic bounds, is to provide more flexible and less pessimistic worst-case evaluation with probabilistic safety guarantees. Empirically derived distribution models are used to compute the total probability of constraint satisfaction, which is then used for path assessment. Through experiments with a high-fidelity simulator, we empirically show that p-ACE relaxes the deterministic state bounds without losing safety guarantees.",

        "abstract": "When learning skills from demonstrations, one is often required to think in advance about the appropriate task representation (usually in either operational or configuration space). We here propose a probabilistic approach for simultaneously learning and synthesizing torque control commands which take into account task space, joint space and force constraints. We treat the problem by considering different torque controllers acting on the robot, whose relevance is learned probabilistically from demonstrations. This information is used to combine the controllers by exploiting the properties of Gaussian distributions, generating new torque commands that satisfy the important features of the task. We validate the approach in two experimental scenarios using 7- DoF torque-controlled manipulators, with tasks that require the consideration of different controllers to be properly executed.",

However, most of the work in this direction has been confined to tasks such as teleoperation, simulation or explication of individual actions of a robot. In this paper, we will discuss how the capability to project intentions affect the task planning capabilities of a robot. Specifically, we will start with a discussion on how projection actions can be used to reveal information regarding the future intentions of the robot at the time of task execution. We will then pose a new planning paradigm - projection-aware planning - whereby a robot can trade off its plan cost with its ability to reveal its intentions using its projection actions. We will demonstrate each of these scenarios with the help of a joint human-robot activity using the HoloLens.",

        "abstract": "Grasping unknown objects has been an active research topic for decades. Approaches range from using various sensors (e.g. vision, tactile) to gain information about the object, to building passively compliant hands that react appropriately to contacts. In this paper, we focus on grasping unknown objects using proprioception (the combination of joint position and torque sensing). Our hypothesis is that proprioception alone can be the basis for versatile performance, including multiple types of grasps for objects with multiple shapes and sizes, and transitions between grasps. Using a series-elastic-actuated gripper, we propose a method for performing stable fingertip grasps for unknown objects with unknown contacts, formulated as multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) control. We also show that the proprioceptive gripper can perform enveloping grasps, as well as the transition from fingertip grasps to enveloping grasps.",

        "abstract": "Intelligent service robots are used at a significant level to uplift the living standards of domestic users. These robots are expected to possess human-friendly interactive features. Service robots should be able to provide a variety of tasks to support independent living of users in domestic environments. Therefore, a service robot often needs to approach users to execute these services and the approach toward the users should be human friendly. In order to achieve this, proxemics planner of a service robot should be cable of deciding the approaching proxemics based on user behavior. This paper proposes a method to decide the approaching proxemics based on the behavior of the user. A fuzzy interference system has been designed to decide the proxemics based on the user behavior identified through body parameters. This leads to an effective interaction mechanism initiated by a robot in such a way that the approaching scenario looks more humanlike. The proposed concept has been implemented on MIRob platform and experiments were conducted in an artificially created domestic environment. The experimental results of the proposed system have been compared with results of a human study to evaluate the performance of the system.",

Currently, most androids are confined within controlled environments rendering interactions between potential end-users, and robots challenging. Even more challenging is for researchers to investigate end-users' perception of androids. We exploit pre-existing YouTube comments as artifacts for quantitative content analysis to gain an indication of social perception on androids. We perform a content analysis of 10301 YouTube comments from four different videos, and reflect on the textual reactions to video stimuli of four extremely human-like android robots. We use text mining and machine learning techniques to process and analyze our corpus. Our findings reveal three equally important topics that should be considered for paving the way towards a robotic society: human-robot relationships, technical specifications, and the science fiction valley. Considering people's attitudes, fears and wishes towards androids, researchers can increase citizen awareness, and engagement.",

The knowledge of the payload mass and its center of mass in realtime is an asset for robust control of the device, which is required to ensure a good stability, especially when the objects have different shapes, sizes and masses. Accordingly, this paper aims at experimentally evaluating the effects of (i) the pulleys modeling and (ii) the use of force sensors for the payload estimation. It turns out that the consideration of the pulleys into the geometric model of the robot improves the mass and center of mass estimations of the payload. A comparison is made between the estimation of cable tensions from force sensors and from motor currents. Finally, a torque controller with a feedforward term for real-time mass compensation is proposed and implemented on a CDPR prototype.",

        "abstract": "A novel gait planning and control framework was developed for quadruped locomotion of a robot. It modeled the quadruped robot as two bipeds carrying the body from the front and rear ends. We first mapped the relationship between the joint torques of support legs and the torso forces of the bipedal sub-robots. Then the equations describing the relationship between the quadruped body forces and the bipedal torso forces under various operating modes of the robot were deduced and solved. Virtual forces were generated on the quadruped body to manipulate its velocity and orientation. Then these virtual forces were distributed to the front and hind sub-robots to generate support leg torques. The state machines and gait generators for the two bipedal sub-robots were designed individually, resulting in the decoupling of the gait parameters in the front legs and hind legs. The effectiveness of the controller was validated through dynamic simulations.",

Existing work has shown how this is only possible within a non-convex programming framework, finding a solution of which is well-known to be very hard. We propose a way to formulate the joint optimization problem as an approximate QP with linear constraints, whose global optimum can be quickly found with off-the-shelf solvers. More specifically, this is done by introducing auxiliary states and control inputs, each of which is subject to linear constraints that are inspired from the literature on bipedal locomotion. Finally, we validate our method on the CENTAURO robot, a hybrid wheeled-legged quadruped with a humanoid upper-body.",

High-quality dense depth maps are estimated and fused into 3D reconstructions in real-time using a single localized moving camera. The quadtree structure of the intensity image is used to reduce the computation burden by estimating the depth map in multiple resolutions. Both the quadtree-based pixel selection and the dynamic belief propagation are proposed to speed up the mapping process: pixels are selected and optimized with the computation resource according to their levels in the quadtree. Solved depth estimations are further interpolated and fused temporally into full resolution depth maps and fused into dense 3D maps using truncated signed distance function (TSDF). We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods using the public datasets. Onboard UAV autonomous flight is also used to further prove the usability and efficiency of our method on portable devices.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a dexterous three degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) wrist mechanism with a large range of motion and uniform manipulability without singular points throughout the entire range of motion. It has a 2-DOF spherical pure rolling joint surrounded by two pairs of actuating wires, the motions of which directly represent the quaternion values of the joint; this joint is therefore named the quaternion joint. Based on this property, it has simple and clear forward and inverse kinematics and high manipulability. By adding a 1-DOF rotation joint at the distal end of the quaternion joint, it can be extended to a 3-DOF joint mechanism. To precisely approximate the spherical pure rolling motion in a confined central space, a novel parallel mechanism composed of three identical supporting linkages was introduced. Unlike conventional parallel mechanisms, it has a compact and simple structure with no interference among the supporting linkages. Because the wrist mechanism is a tendon-driven mechanism, and is thus suitable for lightweight manipulators, it is mounted to a low-inertia manipulator with high stiffness and strength, namely, LIMS2-AMBIDEX, which is an improved version of the authors' previous research. The basic concept and thorough theoretical analysis of the wrist mechanism are described herein, and the simulations and experiments conducted for a quantitative validation are presented.",

The algorithm starts growing a graph on the lowest dimensional quotient space, switches to the next quotient space once a valid path has been found, and keeps updating the graphs on each quotient space simultaneously until a valid path in the configuration space has been found. We show that this algorithm is probabilistically complete and outperforms a set of state-of-the-art algorithms implemented in the open motion planning library (OMPL).",

        "abstract": "This video features RAMCIP, a new service robot developed to provide proactive and discreet assistance to elderly with Mild Cognitive Impairments (MCI), supporting their daily activities at home. Starting with a thorough analysis of needs and requirements of the target population, the RAMCIP robot was developed as an integrated ensemble of advanced H/W and S/W components, realizing the robot skills of perception, cognition, safe navigation, grasping, manipulation, and human-robot communication, ample to operate in real, rather challenging domestic environments. The RAMCIP use-cases include proactive assistance provision to user's cooking, eating and medication activities, through discreet user monitoring and robot interventions by reminders and robotic manipulations., RAMCIP can bring the medicine, recognize fallen objects and electric appliance that has been forgotten turned on. It also recognizes the user walking in low-light conditions and turns on the light, as well as detects cases of emergency such as a fall. The robot provides also the user with cognitive training games and stimulates the user to contact with relatives through video-calls. Pilot trials of the RAMCIP robot have been performed in real homes of more than ten different users, in Barcelona, Spain; the video at hand exhibits the robot performing the target use cases.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Sampling based methods resulted in feasible and effective motion planning algorithms for high dimensional configuration spaces and complex environments. A vast majority of such algorithms as well as their application rely on generating a set of open-loop trajectories first, which are then tracked by feedback control policies. However, controlling a dynamic robot to follow the planned path, while respecting the spatial constraints originating from the obstacles is still a challenging problem. There are some studies which combine statistical sampling techniques and feedback control methods which address this challenge using different approaches. From the feedback control theory perspective, Reference Governors proved to be a useful framework for constraint enforcement. Very recently, Arslan and Koditschek (2017) introduced a feedback motion planner that utilizes Reference Governors that provably solves the motion planning problem in simplified spherical worlds. In this context, here we propose a \u201ctrajectory-free\u201d novel feedback motion planning algorithm which combines the two ideas: random trees and reference governors. Random tree part of the algorithm generates a collision-free region as a set of connected simple polygonal regions. Then, reference governor part navigates the dynamic robot from one region to the adjacent region in the tree structure, ensuring it stays inside the current region and asymptotically reaches to the connected region. Eventually, our algorithm robustly routes the robot from the start location to the goal location without collision. We demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the algorithm on simulation studies.",

        "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR)systems let users intuitively interact with 3D environments and have been used extensively for robotic teleoperation tasks. While more immersive than their 2D counterparts, early VR systems were expensive and required specialized hardware. Fortunately, there has been a recent proliferation of consumer-grade VR systems at affordable price points. These systems are inexpensive, relatively portable, and can be integrated into existing robotic frameworks. Our group has designed a VR teleoperation package for the Robot Operating System (ROS), ROS Reality, that can be easily integrated into such frameworks. ROS Reality is an open-source, over-the-Internet teleoperation interface between any ROS-enabled robot and any Unity-compatible VR headset. We completed a pilot study to test the efficacy of our system, with expert human users controlling a Baxter robot via ROS Reality to complete 24 dexterous manipulation tasks, compared to the same users controlling the robot via direct kinesthetic handling. This study provides insight into the feasibility of robotic teleoperation tasks in VR with current consumer-grade resources and exposes issues that need to be addressed in these VR systems. In addition, this paper presents a description of ROS Reality, its components, and architecture. We hope this system will be adopted by other research groups to allow for easy integration of VR teleoperated robots into future experiments.",

We develop a method for mobile robots to maintain a belief of each other's positions using locally available information. They can use their belief to plan paths with high probabilities of reconnection. This approach also works for subteams cooperatively searching for a robot or group of robots that they would like to reconnect with. The problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem which is solved using a branch-and-bound approach. We present simulation results showing the effectiveness of this strategy at reconnecting teams of up to five robots and compare the results to two other strategies.",

Providing mathematical guarantees for such scenarios is challenging but have numerous potential practical applications. Due to the challenges, analysis of reach-avoid problems involves making trade-offs between generality of system dynamics, generality of problem setups, optimality of solutions, and computational complexity. In this paper, we combine sum-of-squares optimization and dynamic programming to address the reach-avoid problem, and provide a conservative solution that maintains reaching and avoidance guarantees. Our method is applicable to polynomial system dynamics and to general problem setups, and is more computationally scalable than previous related methods. Through a numerical example involving two single integrators, we validate our proposed theory and compare our method to Hamilton-Jacobi reachability. Having validated our theory, we demonstrate the computational scalability of our method by computing the reach-avoid set of a system involving two kinematic cars.",

Approximate models are sufficient for many classical robotic applications; however, they no longer suffice for safety-critical applications. For instance, a dangerous situation which has not been detected by model-based testing might occur in a human-robot co-existence scenario since models do not exactly replicate behaviors of real systems-this problem arises no matter how accurate a model is, since even disturbances and sensor noise can cause a mismatch. We address this issue by adding non-determinism to robotic models and by computing the whole set of possible behaviors using reachability analysis. By using reachset conformance, we automatically adjust the required non-determinism so that all recorded behaviors are captured. For the first time this approach is demonstrated for a real robot.",

Discrete map representations are inefficient for collision checking as they are expensive in terms of memory and computation. This paper takes a probabilistic approach to local mapping by representing the environment as a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and leverages its geometric properties to enable efficient collision checking given a time-parameterized trajectory. In contrast to current discretization-based methods, a GMM preserves geometric coverage of the environment without losing representation accuracy with varying map resolutions. We introduce a novel GMM local mapping algorithm that can be used with a single depth camera processed on a single CPU, and provide algorithms for collision avoidance given arbitrary trajectory representations. Finally, we provide experimentation results demonstrating safety, efficiency, and data coverage for real-time collision avoidance with a quadrotor navigating in a cluttered environment.",

        "abstract": "We propose an end-to-end real time framework to generate high resolution graphics grade textured 3D map of urban environment. The generated detailed map finds its application in the precise localization and navigation of autonomous vehicles. It can also serve as a virtual test bed for various vision and planning algorithms as well as a background map in the computer games. In this paper, we focus on two important issues: (i) incrementally generating a map with coherent 3D surface, in real time and (ii) preserving the quality of color texture. To handle the above issues, firstly, we perform a pose-refinement procedure which leverages camera image information, Delaunay triangulation and existing scan matching techniques to produce high resolution 3D map from the sparse input LIDAR scan. This 3D map is then texturized and accumulated by using a novel technique of ray-filtering which handles occlusion and inconsistencies in pose-refinement. Further, inspired by human fovea, we introduce foveal-processing which significantly reduces the computation time and also assists ray-filtering to maintain consistency in color texture and coherency in 3D surface of the output map. Moreover, we also introduce texture error (TE) and mean texture mapping error (MTME), which provides quantitative measure of texturing and overall quality of the textured maps.",

        "abstract": "Clustering is crucial for many computer vision applications such as robust tracking, object detection and segmentation. This work presents a real-time clustering technique that takes advantage of the unique properties of event-based vision sensors. Since event-based sensors trigger events only when the intensity changes, the data is sparse, with low redundancy. Thus, our approach redefines the well-known mean-shift clustering method using asynchronous events instead of conventional frames. The potential of our approach is demonstrated in a multi-target tracking application using Kalman filters to smooth the trajectories. We evaluated our method on an existing dataset with patterns of different shapes and speeds, and a new dataset that we collected. The sensor was attached to the Baxter robot in an eye-in-hand setup monitoring real-world objects in an action manipulation task. Clustering accuracy achieved an F-measure of 0.95, reducing the computational cost by 88% compared to the frame-based method. The average error for tracking was 2.5 pixels and the clustering achieved a consistent number of clusters along time.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The development of robots that can dance has received considerable attention. However, they are often either limited to a pre-defined set of movements and music or demonstrate little variance when reacting to external stimuli, such as microphone or camera input. In this paper, we contribute with a novel approach allowing a legged robot to listen to live music while dancing in synchronization with the music in a diverse fashion. This is achieved by extracting the beat from an onboard microphone in real-time, and subsequently creating a dance choreography by picking from a user-generated dance motion library at every new beat. Dance motions include various stepping and base motions. The process of picking from the library is defined by a probabilistic model, namely a Markov chain, that depends on the previously picked dance motion and the current music tempo. Finally, delays are determined online by time-shifting a measured signal and a reference signal, and minimizing the least squares error with the time-shift as parameter. Delays are then compensated for by using a combined feedforward and feedback delay controller which shifts the robot whole-body controller reference input in time. Results from experiments on a quadrupedal robot demonstrate the fast convergence and synchrony to the perceived music.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel real-time method for tracking planar edge templates. This method tracks an edge template by estimating its homography transformations with respect to the sampled edge pixels detected from the incoming frames. Particularly, we define a cost function based on a new feature map of the to-be-tracked edge template and optimize it by a Lucas-Kanade-like algorithm. The feature map is defined as the fourth root of the distance transform. Our method operates on just edges so that it is good at tracking those low textured targets, such as hollow targets (mug rim), thin targets (cable, ring) and non-Lambertian objects (disc). We validate and compare our method with four other methods on five newly collected real-world video sequences. The results achieves the lowest overall average error (1.58 pixels) and also outperforms others in terms of success rate. The per frame processing time of about 30 ms proves that our method is acceptable in realtime applications. The code and dataset are publicly available at: http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~xuebin/.",

        "abstract": "Without the 3-D geometry of the target and robust to camera calibration error, image-based visual servoing schemes have gained a lot of attention. However, the depth of the selected feature, which is involved in the interaction matrix relating the time variation of the feature to the velocity twist of the camera, must be estimated correctly to guarantee the stability of the controller. To this end, this paper proposes a new nonlinear reduced-order observer structure to recover the feature depth in real time. Compared with the existing works, the proposed observer has a global asymptotic convergence property and fast convergence rate, and the convergence rate can be easily adjusted only using a single gain parameter. In addition, the proposed observer has a less restrictive observability condition and stronger robustness to noisy measurements. Extensive comparative numerical simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed depth observer.",

        "abstract": "Grasp planning for multi-fingered hands is computationally expensive due to the joint-contact coupling, surface nonlinearities and high dimensionality, thus is generally not affordable for real-time implementations. Traditional planning methods by optimization, sampling or learning work well in planning for parallel grippers but remain challenging for multi-fingered hands. This paper proposes a strategy called finger splitting, to plan precision grasps for multi-fingered hands starting from optimal parallel grasps. The finger splitting is optimized by a dual-stage iterative optimization including a contact point optimization (CPO) and a palm pose optimization (PPO), to gradually split fingers and adjust both the contact points and the palm pose. The dual-stage optimization is able to consider both the object grasp quality and hand manipulability, address the nonlinearities and coupling, and achieve efficient convergence within one second. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The simulation video is available at [1].",

In this paper we present a software framework for utilizing any array of multiple cameras with sufficient field-of-view (FOV) overlap as a light field imaging system. We show that the typical linear arrays that exist on autonomous cars are sufficient to capture stable time resolved light fields even when moving at highway speeds. We elaborate on the potential pitfalls associated with such a technique namely loss of calibration between cameras due to high frequency vibrations and sudden shocks associated with driving over potholes and highlight a method that can compensate for such effects. We demonstrate that the light fields collected by simple linear arrays can be processed in real time for a wide variety of useful applications including occlusion removal, for signal enhancement in featureless images captured in very low light, for reflection removal and for improved visibility in extreme conditions associated with snow and heavy rain.",

This is particularly evident when the motion is repeated multiple times with only a limited amount of variation between each run. To address this issue, we propose the DRM-connect algorithm, a combination of dynamic reachability maps (DRM) with lazy collision checking and a fallback strategy based on the RRT-connect algorithm which is used to repair the roadmap through further exploration. This fallback allows us to use much sparser roadmaps. Furthermore, we investigate using an approximate Reeb graph to capture the topology-persistent features of the past solutions of the problem utilising this sparsity. We evaluate DRM-connect with a Reeb graph on reaching tasks, and we compare it to state-of-the-art methods. We show that the proposed method outperforms both RRT-connect and BKPIECE algorithms in the number of collision checks required and we show that our method has the potential to scale to systems with higher number degrees of freedom.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we introduce pose interpreter networks for 6-DoF object pose estimation. In contrast to other CNN-based approaches to pose estimation that require expensively annotated object pose data, our pose interpreter network is trained entirely on synthetic pose data. We use object masks as an intermediate representation to bridge real and synthetic. We show that when combined with a segmentation model trained on RGB images, our synthetically trained pose interpreter network is able to generalize to real data. Our end-to-end system for object pose estimation runs in real-time (20 Hz) on live RGB data, without using depth information or ICP refinement.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we employ convex optimization to perform real-time 3-dimensional path planning on-board a quad-rotor and demonstrate its real-time capabilities. Building on our previous work, we make the following modifications: (1)we assume the obstacles are mobile, and (2)we introduce a simple framework to continuously recompute and update the trajectory. The contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of real-time on-board convex-optimization-based path planning. For multi-rotors with fixed-pitch propellers, this path planning problem has two sources of non-convexity. First, since fixed-pitch actuators produce uni-directional thrust, the commanded total thrust must be maintained above a non-zero minimum in order to retain sufficient independent attitude control authority. The second source of non-convexity is due to the keep-out zones that envelop each obstacle. To circumvent the non-convexities introduced by these control and state constraints, we employ lossless and successive con-vexification, respectively. Consequently, we cast the original problem as a sequence of Second-Order Cone Programming problems, which can be solved quickly and reliably on-board. We conclude by presenting indoor flight demonstration and timing results of a scenario with three mobile obstacles. In this scenario, our algorithm assumes that the obstacles move with constant acceleration, and is re-executed regularly to account for uncertainties in the motion of the obstacles. The results show that new trajectories can be computed at rates in excess of 10 Hz, quickly enough to adapt to the uncertainty introduced in our flight demonstration.",

        "abstract": "Real-time Segmentation is of crucial importance to robotics related applications such as autonomous driving, driving assisted systems, and traffic monitoring from unmanned aerial vehicles imagery. We propose a novel two-stream convolutional network for motion segmentation, which exploits flow and geometric cues to balance the accuracy and computational efficiency trade-offs. The geometric cues take advantage of the domain knowledge of the application. In case of mostly planar scenes from high altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), homography compensated flow is used. While in the case of urban scenes in autonomous driving, with GPS/IMU sensory data available, sparse projected depth estimates and odometry information are used. The network provides 4.7\u00d7 speedup over the state of the art networks in motion segmentation from 153ms to 36ms, at the expense of a reduction in the segmentation accuracy in terms of pixel boundaries. This enables the network to perform real-time on a Jetson T\u00d72. In order to recuperate some of the accuracy loss, geometric priors is used while still achieving a much improved computational efficiency with respect to the state-of-the-art. The usage of geometric priors improved the segmentation in UAV imagery by 5.2 % using the metric of IoU over the baseline network. While on KITTI-MoSeg the sparse depth estimates improved the segmentation by 12.5 % over the baseline. Our proposed motion segmentation solution is verified on the popular KITTI and VIVID datasets, with additional labels we have produced. The code for our work is publicly available at1.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a real-time method for estimating the shape of an elastic rod using a robot manipulator equipped with a sense of force. The proposed method does not use optical sensing devices, such as cameras or lasers, but relies only upon the sense of force in the manipulator. In the proposed method, the deformation of an elastic rod is calculated from the obtained force/torque information using the discretized Kirchhoff elastic rod model, and the three-dimensional shape of the rod is then estimated. Furthermore, by integrating the force information with the orientation of the manipulator end-effector, the proposed method can evaluate the effect of gravity on the shape estimation accurately. Experiments were carried out to verify the proposed method, where a thin elastic strip was employed as a typical elastic rod, attached to the end-effector of the robot manipulator, bent and twisted into various shapes. The results show that the proposed method that compensates for gravity is better than a method without gravity compensation, and it estimated the 142 mm length strip shape with a position error no greater than 7.76 mm and an average calculation time of 4.24 ms.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we describe the method and implementation of a real-time tumor tracking system for a pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy system. PBS is an advanced cancer treatment system that can benefit from precise localization of the tumors through motion. We utilize techniques such as cross-correlation matching, correlation filters and small object saliency, creating an array of methods that can detect and track fiducial markers implanted in the cancer tumors. The final aim is to control the proton beam using real-time image guidance. Our technique works robustly on various types of markers such as ceramic/metallic fiducials, visicoil markers and surgical clips. Left and right views of an X-ray fluoroscopy system were utilized to also triangulate the marker positions in full 3D as they are tracked through normal breathing movement and organ motion. We have tested our detection system on data from several patients with different tumor locations both offline and in real-time and wish to implement it within a full treatment system soon. To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first real time tracking system for PBS therapy that is applicable for various types of fiducials and tumor locations.",

Due to the assumption of static scene, popular 3D reconstruction technologies such as KinectFusion and KinFu, find truthful reconstruction with fast motion camera or segmenting a moving object to be a challenge. In this paper, we propose a weighted iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm that uses both depth and RGB information to enhance the stability of camera tracking. Additionally, a GPU-based region growing method that combines depth, normal and intensity level as similarity criteria, is also applied to segment foreground moving objects accurately. For real-time processing and GPU memory efficiency, we also design a combination of point-based and volumetric representation to reconstruct moving objects and static scene, respectively.

        "abstract": "Motor rehabilitation is in increasingly high demand to deal with minor functional motor impairments resulting from stroke, cerebellar ataxia, or Parkinson's disease. Juggling physiotherapy has shown to induce brain plasticity and to improve coordination and balance in this context. The physiotherapy, however, relies on large number of repetitions to be effective which prompts to deploy robots to release the burden on therapists both in terms of time as well as physical strain. This paper provides a framework to enable juggling games for patients in interacting with robots through Virtual Reality (VR). A set of throwing motions is recorded from the therapist and is retargeted to the humanoid robot COMAN's wrist. The respective whole-body motion is then solved in a stack of Quadratic Programs (QP) in a real-time architecture that integrates OROCOS and Gazebo. The resulting motion is finally streamed to VR for animation of the robot and the thrown ball, which the user can catch in VR using a controller device. We regard the VR setting as an essential step towards physiotherapeutic robotic juggling, because it ensures safety of the patients and effective testing of the methods and already has potential for actual therapeutic intervention. The control framework, however, is already validated in this paper for switching to full real-time operation on the physical robot.",

Our hypothesis is that depth images contain less structures and are easier to process than RGB images while keeping the required information for human detection and pose inference, thus allowing the use of simpler networks for the task. Our contributions are threefold. (i) we propose a fast and efficient network based on residual blocks (called RPM) for body landmark localization from depth images; (ii) we created a public dataset DIH comprising more than 170k synthetic images of human bodies with various shapes and viewpoints as well as real (annotated) data for evaluation; (iii) we show that our model trained on synthetic data from scratch can perform well on real data, obtaining similar results to larger models initialized with pre-trained networks. It thus provides a good trade-off between performance and computation. Experiments on real data demonstrate the validity of our approach.",

        "abstract": "We develop a real-time state estimation system to recover the pose and contact formation of an object relative to its environment. In this paper, we focus on the application of inserting an object picked by a suction cup into a tight space, a key technology for robotic packaging. We propose a framework that fuses tactile and visual sensing. Visual sensing is versatile and non-intrusive, but suffers from occlusions and limited accuracy, especially for tasks involving contact. Tactile sensing is local, but provides accuracy and robustness to occlusions. The proposed algorithm to fuse them is based on iSAM, an on-line estimation technique, which we use to incorporate kinematic measurements from the robot, contact geometry of the object and the container, and visual tracking. In this paper, we generalize previous results in planar settings [1] to a 3D task with more complex contact interactions. A key challenge is that we do not observe contact locations between the suction-held object and the container directly. We propose a data-driven method to infer the contact formation, which is then used in real-time by the state estimator. We demonstrate and evaluate the algorithm in a setup instrumented to provide groundtruth.",

This paradigm facilitates the interaction with humans and the understanding of human environments in terms of navigation goals and tasks. At the high level, a semantic navigation system requires two main components: a semantic representation of the environment, and a reasoning system. This paper is focused on develop a model of the environment using semantic concepts. This paper presents two solutions for the semantic navigation paradigm. Both systems implement an ontological model. Whilst the first one uses a relational database, the second one is based on KnowRob. Both systems have been integrated in a semantic navigator. We compare both systems at the qualitative and quantitative levels, and present an implementation on a mobile robot as a proof of concept.",

        "abstract": "Sensory information from an Earth-fixed reference is necessary to guarantee a high localization accuracy of an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV). However, the implementation of these sensors in an underwater environment is challenging because of signal uncertainties and strong signal attenuation. In this paper, we propose an underwater localization scheme with a sensor fusion of inertial navigation system (INS) and received signal strength of electromagnetic (EM) waves sensors. In the proposed sensor-fusion-based localization scheme, the UUV predicts its location by using INS based on dead-reckoning and corrects the predicted position by Kalman filter using EM waves sensor information when the UUV receives the signals of EM waves sensors in underwater wireless sensor networks. The proposed scheme enables localization with high accuracy and high sampling rate during a long-term task. The results of an experiment performed in a basin environment shows the feasibility of the proposed scheme. The scheme achieved reliable localization accuracy by comparing the pre-measured ground-truth position and long-term navigation. These results show the feasibility of exploiting EM waves attenuation as Earth-fixed reference sensors.",

        "abstract": "Small quadrotor UAVs are projected to fly increasingly in urban environments for a wide variety of applications such as disaster response, police surveillance, civil infrastructure inspection, and air quality measurement. Micro UAVs can detect and avoid obstacles using onboard cameras; nevertheless, disturbances such as wind gusts, operator error, or failure of onboard vision can still result in dangerous collisions with objects. In the urban setting, the most predominant obstacles are walls and poles. With the aim of developing collision recovery control solutions for quadrotor UAVs, this paper investigates the collision dynamics between a propeller-protected quadrotor UAV and a vertical pole. Simulations provide insight into a quadrotor's post-collision dynamics and experimental trials demonstrate the feasibility of autonomously recovering to stable flight using only inertial onboard sensing in real-time.",

This setup allows us to control the amount of noise in the robot positioning data and to generate pseudo-random environments, while retaining important physical aspects of the experiment. The effect of inherent noise in the robot infra-red sensors, used for obstacle avoidance, is noted and the importance of modelling such noise in agent-based simulations is highlighted.",

Our recursive Bayesian filtering approach models and fuses multiple non-verbal observations to probabilistically reason about the intended goal of the user. In addition to contextual observations, we model and incorporate the human agent's behavior as goal-directed actions with adjustable rationality to inform the underlying intent. We examine human inference on robot motion and furthermore validate our approach with a human subjects study that evaluates autonomy intent inference performance under a variety of goal scenarios and tasks, by novice subjects. Results show that our approach outperforms existing solutions and demonstrates that the probabilistic fusion of multiple observations improves intent inference and performance for shared-control operation.",

As a result, better efficiency in carrying out dynamics computations is becoming more important. In this study, an efficient method for computing the joint space inertia matrix (JSIM) for high DOF serially linked robots is addressed. We call this method the Geometric Dynamics Algorithm for High number of robot Joints (GDAHJ). GDAHJ is non-symbolic, preserve simple formulation, and it is convenient for numerical implementation. This is achieved by simplifying the way to recursively derive the mass-matrix exploiting the unique property of each column of the JSIM and minimizing the number of operations with O(n2) complexity. Results compare favorably with existing methods, achieving better performance over state-of-the-art by Featherstone when applied for robots with more than 13 DOF.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of building accurate three dimensional (3D)reconstructions of orchard rows. This problem arises in many applications including yield mapping and measuring traits (e.g. trunk diameters)for phenotyping. While 3D reconstructions of side views can be obtained using standard methods, merging the two side-views is difficult due to the lack of overlap between the two partial reconstructions. We present a novel method that utilizes global features to constrain the solution. Specifically, we use information from the silhouettes and the ground plane for alignment. The method is evaluated using multiple simulated and real datasets. For additional information and demonstration of experimental results please see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mGMF2gFv4M.",

        "abstract": "State abstraction in a discrete reinforcement learning setting clusters states sharing a similar optimal action to yield an easier to solve decision process. In this paper, we generalize the concept of state abstraction to continuous action reinforcement learning by defining an abstract state as a state cluster over which a near-optimal policy of simple shape exists. We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm that is able to simultaneously find the state space clustering and the optimal sub-policies in each cluster. The main advantage of the proposed framework is to provide a straightforward way of regularizing reinforcement learning by controlling the behavioral complexity of the learned policy. We apply our algorithm on several benchmark tasks and a robot tactile manipulation task and show that we can match state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning performance by combining a small number of linear policies.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "It is well known that reinforcement learning (RL) can benefit from the use of a dynamic prediction model which is learned on data samples collected online from the process to be controlled. Most RL algorithms are formulated in the state-space domain and use state-space models. However, learning state-space models is difficult, mainly because in the vast majority of problems the full state cannot be measured on the system or reconstructed from the measurements. To circumvent this limitation, we propose to use input-output models of the NARX (nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input) type. Symbolic regression is employed to construct parsimonious models and the corresponding value functions. Thanks to this approach, we can learn accurate models and compute optimal policies even from small amounts of training data. We demonstrate the approach on two simulated examples, a hopping robot and a 1-DOF robot arm, and on a real inverted pendulum system. Results show that our proposed method can reliably determine a good control policy based on a symbolic input-output process model and value function.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses a new attitude determination problem for formations. It considers a three-vehicle formation with relative and inertial measurements from sensors, where Constraints limit the relative measurements, which are not available between two of the vehicles, also known as deputies. The other vehicle is called the chief and does not have any limitation. Furthermore, each of the vehicles has an independent inertial measurement, whose references are known. The goal is to determine all attitude relations, both inertial and relative. The solution for this problem is divided into different stages. First, the relative attitude between the chief and the deputies is assessed, which results in two candidates for each of these relations. Then, each candidate yields a candidate for the inertial attitude of the chief. Next, comparing the four inertial candidates gives the solution for their respective relations and consequently for the relative relations as well. The remaining relations derive directly from those already known. The paper also provides some early insights about degeneracies, possible particular cases of the solution, and the effect of sensor noise. Finally, the solution is validated with a simulation, whose results are similar to attitude determination problems in constrained formations.",

The objective of this work is to study the problem of underwater robot localization. For this, we have considered a task relying on inertial and geophysical sensory. We propose an heuristic model that performs adaptable fusion of information based on the principle of contextually anticipating the localization signal within an ordered neighborhood, such that a set of nodes properties is related to the task context, and the confidence on individual estimates is evaluated before fusing information. The results obtained show that our model outperforms the Kalman filter and the Augmented Monte Carlo Localization algorithms in the task.",

The robot, especially humanoid robot, is also able to improve its athletic performances, such as reaction speed and balancing, through robot sports. Therefore, robots have been developed through performing various robot sports events such as robot soccer, robot marathon, robot fight and so on. In this reason, The Ski Robot Challenge was held in South Korea in commemoration of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games. The event was an Alpine slalom skiing competition in the almost same rules to human's but on a relatively short course (80m). To participate in this ski tournament, the skiing robot DIANA has been developed. In this video, the skiing robot technologies were introduced. At first, she must be able to recognize the flags. The deep learning method was used to recognize them. Secondly, she had a motion pattern to perform the carving turn, the most difficult and fastest skiing technique. In order to improve the stability, she compensated her motion to follow reference COP, based on the measured F/T sensor data. In addition, IMU sensor was used to remove instantaneous disturbance. Using these methods, the humanoid robot, DIANA, that can perform the carved turn on a realworld slope was successfully developed.",

        "abstract": "Applications of safety, security, and rescue in robotics, such as multi-robot target tracking, involve the execution of information acquisition tasks by teams of mobile robots. However, in failure-prone or adversarial environments, robots get attacked, their communication channels get jammed, and their sensors may fail, resulting in the withdrawal of robots from the collective task, and consequently the inability of the remaining active robots to coordinate with each other. As a result, traditional design paradigms become insufficient and, in contrast, resilient designs against system-wide failures and attacks become important. In general, resilient design problems are hard, and even though they often involve objective functions that are monotone or submodular, scalable approximation algorithms for their solution have been hitherto unknown. In this paper, we provide the first algorithm, enabling the following capabilities: minimal communication, i.e., the algorithm is executed by the robots based only on minimal communication between them; system-wide resiliency, i.e., the algorithm is valid for any number of denial-of-service attacks and failures; and provable approximation performance, i.e., the algorithm ensures for all monotone (and not necessarily submodular) objective functions a solution that is finitely close to the optimal. We quantify our algorithms approximation performance using a notion of curvature for monotone set functions. We support our theoretical analyses with simulated and real-world experiments, by considering an active information gathering scenario, namely, multi-robot target tracking.",

The main objects of interest are the 50nm diameter liposomes, while the 100nm diameter liposomes are widely used for its stability. However, certain drug delivery scenarios arise, like tighter cancerous tissue arrangement and different circulation time requirement, which dictates the necessity of sub-100nm diameter vesicles. The size measurements upon freshly fabricated liposomes are performed frequently on increasing time interval. The results exhibit a trend of size increasing, suggesting the existence of liposome fusion. The possible models of fusion are proposed and discussed. This work demonstrates the localized organic nanoparticle measurement with fine dual 3D manipulator positioning, which paves the way for the possible cellular in-vivo measurement within an environmental SEM chamber.",

        "abstract": "The sequential online tuning for controller gains is required for the continuous action of the riding into parallel two-wheeled scooter and the speed governing after riding by humanoid robot. The implemented controllers are different between the riding and the speed governing, and these tuning strategies are also different. In particular, the riding requires the immediate tuning in the short riding phase and the speed governing requires the accurate tuning to regulate the speed of humanoid robot. To the above requirements, this paper proposes the Sequential Online Learning Control (SOLC)method composed of the cascade connection of SGD-based open-loop Learning Control (SLC)and Mini-batch-based closed-loop Learning Control (MLC). SLC contributes the damping gain online tuning for the foot torque control during execution of riding, and MLC contributes the PID gains online tuning for the speed governing control. Finally, we show the validity of SOLC through the sequential experiment of riding and speed governing for parallel two-wheeled scooter by life-sized humanoid robot HRP2-JSK.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a risk-based coordination method for the Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problem in human-populated environments. We introduce risk-based bids that incorporate human trajectory prediction uncertainties and furthermore, social costs in their formulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of including a predictive component in the risk formulation despite the lack of accurate position estimation for humans through an extensive suite of experiments. This is done by means of testing different levels of prediction error for known human trajectories and in a separate approach, using a Kalman filter for human trajectory estimation. Furthermore, we propose different risk formulations and evaluate their performance in a high-fidelity simulator. Additionally, a comparative study targeting human-agnostic planning at both navigation and planning levels, human-aware navigation and planning based on deterministic costs, and risk-based human-aware planning with no individual human-aware navigation has been conducted. Results confirm that risk-based bids lead to more socially acceptable team plans that reduce the need for the lower level individual human-aware navigation to be activated. Risk-based plans accounting for social costs prevent difficult social situations that can lead to less effective human-aware navigation, such as traversing narrow passages occupied by humans.",

Systems based on optical tracking navigation impose a stringent limitation in the workflow of surgeons since a clear line of sight has to be kept between the cameras and the tracked elements. Other solutions are based on mounting a miniature robot on the spine of the patient, which is very invasive and entails some risks. For these reasons, a novel robotic assisted surgery system capable to guide surgical instruments with minimal deviations compensating patient motion is being developed. This paper presents the system and the electromechanical tracking device used to sense patient motion.",

The key idea of the proposed approach is to deliberately reformulate the 3D VINS with respect to a moving local frame (i.e., robocentric), rather than a fixed global frame of reference as in the standard world-centric VINS, and instead utilize high-accuracy relative motion estimates for global pose update. As an immediate advantage of using this robocentric formulation, the proposed R-VIO can start from an arbitrary pose, without the need to align its orientation with the global gravity vector. More importantly, we analytically show that the proposed robocentric EKF-based VINS does not undergo the observability mismatch issue as in the standard world-centric frameworks which was identified as the main cause of inconsistency of estimation. The proposed R-VIO is extensively tested through both Monte Carlo simulations and real-world experiments using different sensor platforms in different environments and shown to achieve competitive performance with the state-of-the-art VINS algorithms in terms of consistency, accuracy and efficiency.",

In the current work, the robot is able to predict the best encounter point between the human-robot group and the approached person. Then, in the encounter point the robot modifies its position to achieve an engagement with both people. The encounter point is computed using a gradient descent method that takes into account all people predictions. Moreover, we make use of the Extended Social Force Model (ESFM), and it is modified to include the dynamic goal. The method has been validated over several situations and in real-life experiments, in addition, a user study has been realized to reveal the social acceptability of the robot in this task.",

In the cartoon style transformation stage, it transfers human portrait photos to cartoon style by face detection and alignment, which can effectively decompose the face into individual components then replace by cartoon facial components. In the second stage, the robot uses an eye-in-hand system to obtain five basic colors (cyan, magenta, yellow, white and black) to automatically mix a variety of colors automatically. For painting strategy, we start with the outline of the face, which we use non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) to generate hand-painted strokes. After that, the robot artist will implement painting the facial features. We also demonstrate the success of this proposed research.",

In this paper, we analyzed the behavior of humans balancing on a narrow beam without footwear. The results revealed high anti-correlation between lumped upper- and lower-body angular momentum. Despite differences in gross measures of balance, interlimb coordination was consistent between the novice and expert subjects, suggesting that both performances could be described with the same balance controller. By simulating a double inverted pendulum model utilizing different balancing controllers described in the robotics literature, we identified that the whole behavior observed from humans standing on a beam was best replicated with controllers that predominantly utilized hip actuation.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel approach to establish the relative pose of a mobile robot with respect to an operator that wants to interact with it; we focus on scenarios in which the robot is in the same environment as the operator, and is visible to them. The approach is based on comparing the trajectory of the robot, which is known in the robot's odometry frame, to the motion of the arm of the operator, who, for a short time, keeps pointing at the robot they want to interact with. In multi-robot scenarios, the same approach can be used to simultaneously identify which robot the operator wants to interact with. The main advantage over alternatives is that our system only relies on the robot's odometry, on a wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU), and, crucially, on the operator's own perception. We experimentally show the feasibility of our approach using real-world robots.",

        "abstract": "Continuous Goal-Directed Actions (CGDA)is a robot imitation framework that encodes actions as the changes they produce on the environment. While it presents numerous advantages with respect to other robot imitation frameworks in terms of generalization and portability, final robot joint trajectories for the execution of actions are not necessarily encoded within the model. This is studied as an optimization problem, and the solution is computed through evolutionary algorithms in simulated environments. Evolutionary algorithms require a large number of evaluations, which had made the use of these algorithms in real world applications very challenging. This paper presents online evolutionary strategies, as a change of paradigm within CGDA execution. Online evolutionary strategies shift and merge motor execution into the planning loop. A concrete online evolutionary strategy, Online Evolved Trajectories (OET), is presented. OET drastically reduces computational times between motor executions, and enables working in real world dynamic environments and/or with human collaboration. Its performance has been measured against Full Trajectory Evolution (FTE)and Incrementally Evolved Trajectories (IET), obtaining the best overall results. Experimental evaluations are performed on the TEO full-sized humanoid robot with \u201cpaint\u201d and \u201ciron\u201d actions that together involve vision, kinesthetic and force features.",

Using a mixed reality head-mounted display (Microsoft Hololens) and a 7-DOF robot arm, we designed an augmented reality (AR) robotic interface with four interactive functions to ease the robot programming task: 1) Trajectory specification. 2) Virtual previews of robot motion. 3) Visualization of robot parameters. 4) Online reprogramming during simulation and execution. We validate our AR-robot teaching interface by comparing it with a kinesthetic teaching interface in two different scenarios as part of a pilot study: creation of contact surface path and free space path. Furthermore, we present an industrial case study that illustrates our AR manufacturing paradigm by interacting with a 7-DOF robot arm to reduce wrinkles during the pleating step of the carbon-fiber-reinforcement-polymer vacuum bagging process in a simulated scenario.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Multiplayer environments are thought to increase and prolongate active participation in robot-aided rehabilitation. We expect that environments linking patients with their spouses will particularly foster active participation. Thus, we developed two multiplayer games to link the game experience of two players: an Air Hockey game and a Haptic Kitchen game. In the competitive Air Hockey game, differences in skill levels between players were balanced by individualizing haptic guidance or damping forces. In the Haptic Kitchen game, a healthy player could support the patient's movements using a virtual force field. The two players could control the haptic interaction since both the force field and the point of application were visualized. We tested the haptic performance balancing algorithm of the Air Hockey game and the spouse-controlled haptic support of the Kitchen game with patients post-stroke who trained both single- (i.e., alone) and multiplayer training (i.e., with spouse) in eight therapy sessions lasting 45 min each. Mean total rating in Intrinsic Motivation Inventory was 46.9 points (out of 63 points) for multiplayer modes, and 42.7 points for single player modes, respectively. The spouses applied the haptic support in the Haptic Kitchen game during 42 % of the total game duration. We are currently testing more patient-spouse couples to better understand the effects of using these haptic approaches on the behavior and recovery of patients. We foresee this approach can improve the motivation during training and positively influence the at-home behavior of patients, an important goal of rehabilitation training efforts.",

        "abstract": "Kinesthetic learning is a type of learning from demonstration in which the teacher manually moves the robot through the demonstrated trajectory. It shows great promise in the area of assistive robotics since it enables a caretaker who is not an expert in computer programming to communicate a novel task to an assistive robot. However, the trajectory the caretaker demonstrates to solve the task may be a high-cost trajectory for the robot. The demonstrated trajectory could be high-cost because the teacher does not know what trajectories are easy or hard for the robot to perform, which would be due to a limitation of the teacher's knowledge, or because the teacher has difficulty moving all the robotic joints precisely along the desired trajectories, which would be due to a limitation of the teacher's coordination. We propose the Parameterized Similar Path Search (PSPS) algorithm to extend kinesthetic learning so that a robot can improve the learned trajectory over a known cost function. This algorithm is based on active learning from the robot through collaboration between the robot's knowledge of the cost function and the caretaker's knowledge of the constraints of the assigned task.",

This paper reports on a five degrees of freedom robotic system capable of performing accurate and repeatable repair procedures through a narrow inspection port, which minimizes the cost and downtime associated with unscheduled maintenance. Careful study of the target working volume and repair process informed the design of a robotic probe capable of replicating the operation. Kinematic analysis of the robot's flexible, prismatic and rotary joints was used to define accurate machining paths in 3D space, and the results were verified using an optical motion capture system (accuracy of 0.25 mm). After comprehensive verifications of the constitutive elements, the robotic system was successfully demonstrated for repair of a high-pressure compressor aerofoil in a gas turbine. The results not only proves the ability of the system to address such difficult repair scenarios but also highlights a domain of opportunities in developing specialist robotics for repair of high-value assets, which is a subject to growing global demand.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The robustness of the positioning and posturing of robot hands relative to target object and support surface is an important issue for autonomous grasping. For example, to perform a grasping action such as picking up thin objects from a table top, the position and posture of the hand must be controlled to keep adequate relative posture and distance to the support surface besides those between the hand and the target object. Because slight errors in the posture and position are enough to cause grasping failure, the positioning and posturing of the hand must be precise enough, specially when the hand is close to the target object and support surface. To improve the robustness of robotic grasping, in this paper we present a method by grasping control based on the relative posture and position between hand and support surface besides those between hand and target object, using proximity sensors. Proximity sensors are newly installed on fingernails besides on the fingertips. As the fingernail sensor, an integration of Time-of-Flight (TOF) sensor and photo-reflector is designed to realize long range detection, as well as with precise and high-speed detection regardless of the reflectance of support surfaces when approaching the support surface. By the sensors, the hand can approach the object and support surface coarsely first, and then can be controlled fast and precisely to realize adequate grasping motion along the support surface but without contact with the support face. The method has been implemented to a manipulator system, and successful grasping experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a wearable robotic stick for walking assistance, called \u201cHand-Free-Stick\u201d (HFS), for people with non-serious dysfunction in their gait. The basic idea of the proposed HFS is to enlarge ZMP (Zero moment point) area of a user under hands free conditions and to augment his/her body balance ability in walking. A boots type prototype of the HFS is developed with a lightweight robotic stick using a servomotor, in which the slider-link mechanism works to regulate the stick angle and length at the same time. The stick motion is controlled by a single-board computer based on the distribution of foot/feet pressures measured by the sensor system using eight load cells attached at the sole of boots. A set of walking tests with/without the prototype of HFS is carried out for four healthy subjects and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed HFS to expand the ZMP area leading to walking balance assistance.",

        "abstract": "The robotic handling of compliant and deformable food raw materials, characterized by high biological variation, complex geometrical 3D shapes, and mechanical structures and texture, is currently in huge demand in the ocean space, agricultural, and food industries. Many tasks in these industries are performed manually by human operators who, due to the laborious and tedious nature of their tasks, exhibit high variability in execution, with variable outcomes. The introduction of robotic automation for most complex processing tasks has been challenging due to current robot learning policies. A more consistent learning policy involving skilled operators is desired. In this paper, we address the problem of robot learning when presented with inconsistent demonstrations. To this end, we propose a robust learning policy based on Learning from Demonstration (LfD) for robotic grasping of food compliant objects. The approach uses a merging of RGB-D images and tactile data in order to estimate the necessary pose of the gripper, gripper finger configuration and forces exerted on the object in order to achieve effective robot handling. During LfD training, the gripper pose, finger configurations and tactile values for the fingers, as well as RGB-D images are saved. We present an LfD learning policy that automatically removes inconsistent demonstrations, and estimates the teacher's intended policy. The performance of our approach is validated and demonstrated for fragile and compliant food objects with complex 3D shapes. The proposed approach has a vast range of potential applications in the aforementioned industry sectors.",

Leveraging on using a customized robotic sewing device and closed-loop visual servoing control, an all-in-one solution for sewing personalized stent graft is demonstrated. Stitch size planning and automated knot tying are proposed as two key functions of the system. By using effective stitch size planning, sub-millimetre sewing accuracy is achieved for stitch sizes ranging from 2mm to 5mm. In addition, a thread manipulator for thread management and tension control is also proposed to perform successive knot tying to secure each stitch. Detailed laboratory experiments have been performed to evaluate the proposed instruments and allied algorithms. The proposed framework can be generalised to a wide range of applications including 3D industrial sewing, as well as transferred to other clinical areas such as surgical suturing.",

Furthermore, we fuse visual simultaneous localization and mapping outputs, encoder readings with GPR scans to classify hyperbolas into different pipeline groups. We extensively apply the J-Linkage method and maximum likelihood estimation to improve algorithm robustness and accuracy. As the result, we optimally estimate the radii and locations of all pipelines. We have implemented our method and tested it in physical experiments with representative pipeline configurations. The results show that our method successfully reconstructs all subsurface pipes. Moreover, the average localization error is 4.69cm.",

Real-world bin-picking settings such as warehouses present additional challenges, e.g., new objects are added constantly. Most of the existing object pose estimation methods assume that 3D models of the objects is available beforehand. We present a pipeline that requires minimal human intervention and circumvents the reliance on the availability of 3D models by a fast data acquisition method and a synthetic data generation procedure. This work builds on previous work on semantic segmentation of cluttered bin-picking scenes to isolate individual objects in clutter. An additional network is trained on synthetic scenes to estimate object poses from a cropped object-centered encoding extracted from the segmentation results. The proposed method is evaluated on a synthetic validation dataset and cluttered realworld scenes.",

        "abstract": "Estimating the camera pose requires point correspondences. However, in practice, correspondences are inevitably corrupted by outliers, which affects the pose estimation. We propose a general and accurate outlier removal strategy for robust camera pose estimation. The proposed strategy can detect outliers by leveraging the fact that only inliers comply with two effective consensuses, i.e., 3D ray bundle consensus and 2D vector field consensus. Our strategy has a nested structure. First, the outer module utilizes the 3D ray bundle consensus. We define the likelihood based on the probabilistic mixture model and maximize it by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The inlier probability of each correspondence and the camera pose are determined alternately. Second, the inner module exploits the 2D vector field consensus to refine the probabilities obtained by the outer module. The refinement based on the Bayesian rule facilitates the convergence of the outer module and improves the accuracy of the entire framework. Our strategy can be integrated into various existing camera pose estimation methods which are originally vulnerable to outliers. Experiments on both synthesized data and real images have shown that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art outlier rejection methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.",

This paper proposes a robust and efficient decentralized sensor fault detection method with in-place sensor self-recalibration capability that extracts and uses complex context information referred to the full monitored process. The method includes three main components, all decentralized and sharing the same statistical framework: 1) a consensus-based modeling step based on decentralized RANSAC; 2) a statistical analysis based on Bayesian networks and Hidden Markov Models in which each sensor identifies inconsistencies with the consensus model and determines if it is correctly calibrated, uncalibrated or faulty and; 3) a final step in which each uncalibrated sensor self-recalibrates using the consensus model. The proposed method is efficient in the use of computational and communicational resources, it is scalable and robust against outliers, transmission errors, sensor failures and network topology changes. It has been extensively validated in an experimental industrial setting.",

        "abstract": "We study the ambiguous data association problem confronting simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), specifically for the autonomous exploration of environments lacking rich features. In such environments, a single false positive assignment might lead to catastrophic failure, which even robust back-ends may be unable to resolve. Inspired by multiple hypothesis tracking, we present a novel approach to effectively manage multiple hypotheses (MH) of data association inherited from traditional joint compatibility branch and bound (JCBB), which entails the generation, ordering and elimination of hypotheses. We analyze the performance of MHJCBB in two particular situations, one applying it to SLAM over a predefined trajectory and the other showing its applicability in exploring unknown environments. Statistical results demonstrate that MHJCBB's maintenance of diverse hypotheses under ambiguous conditions significantly improves map accuracy.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a guidance vector field strategy to control a fixed-wing UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle)subject to uncertainty in order to converge to and circulate a closed curve in \u211d3. The control system is designed based on a reference model of the airplane with constrained input controls. The law is independent of the vector field's structure, however, some analysis considers a consolidated vector field approach. Asymptotic stability is proven with Lyapunov Theory and ultimate bounds are found when bounded uncertainties are taken into account. The control law is continuous except in the surroundings of the unavoidable field's singularities. A theorem ensures asymptotic convergence when a switch is made. Simulations with a 6 DOF, 12 states realistic aircraft model demonstrate the efficiency of the strategy and its advantages.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We present a novel fruit counting pipeline that combines deep segmentation, frame to frame tracking, and 3D localization to accurately count visible fruits across a sequence of images. Our pipeline works on image streams from a monocular camera, both in natural light, as well as with controlled illumination at night. We first train a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and segment video frame images into fruit and non-fruit pixels. We then track fruits across frames using the Hungarian Algorithm where the objective cost is determined from a Kalman Filter corrected Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) Tracker. In order to correct the estimated count from tracking process, we combine tracking results with a Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm to calculate relative 3D locations and size estimates to reject outliers and double counted fruit tracks. We evaluate our algorithm by comparing with ground-truth human-annotated visual counts. Our results demonstrate that our pipeline is able to accurately and reliably count fruits across image sequences, and the correction step can significantly improve the counting accuracy and robustness. Although discussed in the context of fruit counting, our work can extend to detection, tracking, and counting of a variety of other stationary features of interest such as leaf-spots, wilt, and blossom.",

In this paper, we first formally formulate the generalized point cloud registration problem in a probabilistic manner. Specifically, not only positional but also the orientational information are incorporated into registration. Notably, the positional error is assumed to obey a multivariate Gaussian distribution to accommodate anisotropic cases. Expectation conditional maximization framework is utilized to solve the problem. In E-step, the correspondence probabilities between points in two generalized point clouds are computed. In M -step, the constrained optimization problem with respect to the transformation matrix is re-formulated as an unconstrained one. Extensive experiments are conducted to compare the proposed algorithm with the state-of-the-art registration methods. The experimental results demonstrate the algorithm's robustness to noise and outliers, fast convergence speed.",

        "abstract": "We propose a control framework for torque controlled humanoid robots that efficiently minimizes the tracking error in a Quadratic Programming (QP)formulated as multiobjective weighted tasks with constraints. It results in an optimal dynamically-feasible reference that can be tracked robustly, with exponential convergence, without joint torque feedback, in the presence of non modelled torque bias and low-frequency bounded disturbances. This is achieved by introducing integral gains in a Lyapunov-stable torque control, which exploit the passivity properties of the dynamical model of the robot and their effect on the dynamic constraints of the QP solver. The robustness of this framework is demonstrated in simulation by commanding our robot, the HRP-5P, to achieve simultaneously several objectives in the configuration and the Cartesian spaces, in the presence of non-modeled static and kinetic joint friction, as well as an uncertain torque scale.",

Many applications require robots to actively control the deformation of soft objects, such as soft tissues in surgery. Thus, this study presents a robust model-predictive deformation control of a soft object using a flexible continuum robot. A linear approximation model for mapping from actuation space of a continuum robot to deformation space of a soft object is established. Jacobian matrix is estimated online by using a robust Geman-McClure estimator. Then, the deformation of the soft object is regulated by using a prediction horizon-based controller with exponential weighting for model uncertainty. The proposed control approach is effective in manipulating a soft object with a flexible continuum robot that is in contact with obstacles.",

        "abstract": "Despite the recent success of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms in object recognition, when these are deployed as-is on a mobile service robot, we observed that they failed to recognize many objects in real human environments. In this paper, we introduce a learning algorithm in which robots address this flaw by asking humans for help, also known as a symbiotic autonomy approach. In particular, we bootstrap YOLOv2, a state-of-the-art deep neural network and train a new neural network, that we call HHELP, using only data collected from human help. Using an RGB camera and an onboard tablet, the robot proactively seeks human input to assist it in labeling surrounding objects. Pepper, located at CMU, and Monarch Mbot, located at ISR-Lisbon, were the service robots that we used to validate the proposed approach. We conducted a study in a realistic domestic environment over the course of 20 days with 6 research participants. To improve object detection, we used the two neural networks, YOLOv2 + HHELP, in parallel. Following this methodology, the robot was able to detect twice the number of objects compared to the initial YOLOv2 neural network, and achieved a higher mAP (mean Average Precision) score. Using the learning algorithm the robot also collected data about where an object was located and to whom it belonged to by asking humans. This enabled us to explore a future use case where robots can search for a specific person's object. We view the contribution of this work to be relevant for service robots in general, in addition to Pepper, and Mbot.",

        "abstract": "Odometry forms an important component of many manned and autonomous systems. In the rail industry in particular, having precise and robust odometry is crucial for the correct operation of the Automatic Train Protection systems that ensure the safety of high-speed trains in operation around the world. Two problems commonly encountered in such odometry systems are miscalibration of the wheel encoders and slippage of the wheels under acceleration and braking, resulting in incorrect velocity estimates. This paper introduces an odometry system that addresses these problems. It comprises of an Extended Kalman Filter that tracks the calibration of the wheel encoders as state variables, and a measurement pre-processing stage called Sensor Consensus Analysis (SCA) that scales the uncertainty of a measurement based on how consistent it is with the measurements from the other sensors. SCA uses the statistical z-test to determine when an individual measurement is inconsistent with the other measurements, and scales the uncertainty until the z-test passes. This system is demonstrated on data from German Intercity-Express highspeed trains and it is shown to successfully deal with errors due to miscalibration and wheel slip.",

        "abstract": "Invariant representations of demonstrated motion trajectories provide context-independent motion models that can be used in motion recognition and generalization applications such as robot programming by demonstration. In practice, the use of invariant representations is still limited because their numerical calculation from a demonstrated trajectory is complicated by sensitivity to measurement noise and singularities, yielding inaccurate invariant functions that do not correspond well with the original trajectory. This paper improves the calculation of invariant representations for point and rigid-body motions by reformulating their calculation as an optimization problem that minimizes the error between the trajectory reconstructed from the invariant representation and the measured trajectory. Robustness against noise and singularities is ensured through the addition of regularization terms on the invariants. Simulations and real motion experiments show that the accuracy of the calculated invariant representations greatly improves with respect to standard smoothing methods. These results encourage future developments of motion recognition and generalization applications based on invariant trajectory representations.",

        "abstract": "Plant phenotyping is the measurement of observable plant traits. Current methods for phenotyping in the field are labour intensive and error prone. High throughput plant phenotyping in an automated and noninvasive manner is crucial to accelerating plant breeding methods. Occlusions and non-ideal sensing conditions is a major problem for high throughput plant phenotyping with most state-of-the-art 3D phenotyping algorithms relying heavily on heuristics or hand-tuned parameters. To address this problem, we present a novel model-based optimization approach for estimating plant physical traits from plant units called phytomers. The proposed approach involves sampling parameterized 3D plant models from an underlying probability distribution. It then optimizes, making the mass of this probability distribution approach true parameters of the model. Reformulating the phenotyping objective as a search in the space of plant models lets us reason about the plant structure in a holistic manner without having to rely on hand-tuned parameters. This makes our approach robust to noise and occlusions as frequently encountered in real world environments. We evaluate our approach for plant units taken across simulated, greenhouse and field environments. This work furthers field-based robotic phenotyping capabilities paving the way for plant biologists to study the coupled effect of genetics and environment on improving crop yields.",

While effective, this training mechanism presents the potential for sub-optimal demonstrations to negatively impact performance due to unintentional operator error. In this work we introduce Concept Constrained Learning from Demonstration (CC-LfD), a novel algorithm for robust skill learning and skill repair that incorporates annotations of conceptually-grounded constraints (in the form of planning predicates) during live demonstrations into the LfD process. Through our evaluation, we show that CC-LfD can be used to quickly repair skills with as little as a single annotated demonstration without the need to identify and remove low-quality demonstrations. We also provide evidence for potential applications to transfer learning, whereby constraints can be used to adapt demonstrations from a related task to achieve proficiency with few new demonstrations required.",

        "abstract": "A fundamental problem of non-linear state estimation in robotics is the violation of assumptions about the sensors' error distribution. State of the art approaches reduce the impact of these violations with robust cost functions or predefined non-Gaussian error models. Both require extensive parameter tuning and fail if the sensors' error characteristic changes over time, due to environmental changes, ageing or sensor malfunctions. We demonstrate how the error distribution itself can be part of the state estimation process. Based on an efficient approximation of a Gaussian mixture, we optimize the sensor model simultaneously during the standard state estimation. Due to an implicit expectation-maximization approach, we achieve a fast convergence without prior knowledge of the true distribution parameters. We implement this self-tuning algorithm in a least-squares optimization framework and demonstrate its real time capability on a real world dataset for satellite localization of a driving vehicle. The resulting estimation quality is superior to previous robust algorithms.",

We present a multicopter system equipped with two pairs of wide-angle stereo cameras and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) for robust visual-inertial navigation and time-efficient omni-directional 3D mapping. The four cameras cover a 240 degree stereo field of view (FOV) vertically, which makes the system also suitable for cramped and confined environments like caves. In our approach, we synthesize eight virtual pinhole cameras from four wide-angle cameras. Each of the resulting four synthesized pinhole stereo systems provides input to an independent visual odometry (VO). Subsequently, the four individual motion estimates are fused with data from an IMU, based on their consistency with the state estimation. We describe the configuration and image processing of the vision system as well as the sensor fusion and mapping pipeline on board the MAV. We demonstrate the robustness of our multi-VO approach for visual-inertial navigation and present results of a 3D-mapping experiment.",

Following this inspiration, creating programmable systems of self-assembly that achieve similar complexity and robustness with robots is challenging. As a role model we pick the growth of natural plants that adapts to environmental conditions and is robust enough to withstand disturbances such as changes due to dynamic environments and cut parts. We program a robot swarm to self-assemble into tree-like shapes and to adapt efficiently to the environment. Our approach is inspired by the vascular morphogenesis of plants, the patterned formation of vascular tissue to transport fluids and nutrients internally. The aggregated robots establish an internal network of resource sharing, allowing them to make rational decisions collectively about where to add and where to remove robots. As a result, the growth is adaptive to an environmental feature (here, light) and robust to changes in a dynamic environment. The robot swarm is able to self-repair by regrowing lost parts. We successfully validate and benchmark our approach in a number of robot swarm experiments showing adaptivity, robustness, and self-repair.",

        "abstract": "The use of snake-like robots for surgery is a popular choice for intra-luminal procedures. In practice, the requirements for strength, flexibility and accuracy are difficult to be satisfied simultaneously. This paper presents a computational approach for optimizing the design of a snake-like robot using serial rolling-joints and tendons as the base architecture. The method optimizes the design in terms of joint angle range and tendon placement to prevent the tendons and joints from colliding during bending motion. The resulting optimized joints were manufactured using 3D printing. The robot was characterized in terms of workspace, dexterity, precision and manipulation forces. The results show a repeatability as low as 0.9mm and manipulation forces of up to 5.6N.",

        "abstract": "The regrasping function of a robotic hand and arm has been investigated by many studies. Dynamic regrasping is performed by accelerating objects and it has the advantage of being able to perform the regrasp function at high speed. However, the difficulty of increasing the success rate is a persistent problem. In this study, we aimed to realize this continuous high-speed operation by increasing the success rate of the regrasping function. The handling of the Rubik's cube was used as the specific task to be performed. The action that was required to handle the Rubik's cube consisted of two types of regrasping motion and one type of one-face turn motion. In this study, a Rubik's cube was placed in a plane and manipulated by combining these three types of motion. Continuous operation was realized with a robotic hand and high-speed vision by utilizing environmental constraints in order to minimize the error. As a result, we succeeded 3 times in turning and regrasping in 1 s. Additionally, we were able to succeed 30 times in turning and regrasping in 10 s, with a success rate of 70%.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Industrial robots are increasingly used in various applications where the robot accuracy becomes very important, hence calibrations of the robot's kinematic parameters and the measurement system's extrinsic parameters are required. However, the existing calibration approaches are either too cumbersome or require another expensive external measurement system such as laser tracker or measurement spinarm. In this paper, we propose SCALAR, a calibration method to simultaneously improve the kinematic parameters of a 6-DoF robot and the extrinsic parameters of a 2D Laser Range Finder (LRF) that is attached to the robot. Three flat planes are placed around the robot, and for each plane the robot moves to several poses such that the LRF's ray intersect the respective plane. Geometric planar constraints are then used to optimize the calibration parameters using Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear optimization algorithm. We demonstrate through simulations that SCALAR can reduce the average position and orientation errors of the robot system from 14.6 mm and 4.05\u00b0 to 0.09 mm and 0.02\u00b0.",

        "abstract": "We study the labeled multi-robot path planning problem in continuous 2D and 3D domains in the absence of obstacles where robots must not collide with each other. For an arbitrary number of robots in arbitrary initial and goal arrangements, we derive a polynomial time, complete algorithm that produces solutions with constant-factor optimality guarantees on both makespan and distance optimality, in expectation, under the assumption that the robot labels are uniformly randomly distributed. Our algorithm only requires a small constant-factor expansion of the initial and goal configuration footprints for solving the problem, i.e., the problem can be solved in a fairly small bounded region. Beside theoretical guarantees, we present a thorough computational evaluation of the proposed solution. In addition to the baseline implementation, adapting an effective (but non-polynomial time) routing subroutine, we also provide a highly efficient implementation that quickly computes near-optimal solutions. Hardware experiments on the microMVP platform composed of non-holonomic robots confirms the practical applicability of our algorithmic pipeline.",

        "abstract": "We report on the development of a motion generation strategy that allows the robot to transit from one stable running motion to another in one stride by actively changing leg stiffness in real time. Stable motion of the robot is generated based on the stable fixed-point trajectories of the spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) model. While the transition of the ordinary SLIP model with fixed parameters gradually converges if stable, a robot that uses force control to simulate the passive spring of the SLIP can actively modulate leg-spring stiffness. This enables the robot to switch instantly to another fixed-point trajectory of the SLIP model without going through multi-stride transition. The proposed method is implemented on a leg-wheel transformable robot, TurboQuad, and is evaluated experimentally. The results confirm that the robot can successfully transit between different fixed-point trajectories.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Depth cameras have accelerated research in many areas of computer vision. Most triangulation-based depth cameras, whether structured light systems like the Kinect or active (assisted) stereo systems, are based on the principle of stereo matching. Depth from stereo is an active research topic dating back 30 years. Despite recent advances, algorithms usually trade-off accuracy for speed. In particular, efficient methods rely on fronto-parallel assumptions to reduce the search space and keep computation low. We present SOS (Slanted O(1) Stereo), the first algorithm capable of leveraging slanted support windows without sacrificing speed or accuracy. We use an active stereo configuration, where an illuminator textures the scene. Under this setting, local methods - such as PatchMatch Stereo - obtain state of the art results by jointly estimating disparities and slant, but at a large computational cost. We observe that these methods typically exploit local smoothness to simplify their initialization strategies. Our key insight is that local smoothness can in fact be used to amortize the computation not only within initialization, but across the entire stereo pipeline. Building on these insights, we propose a novel hierarchical initialization that is able to efficiently perform search over disparity and slants. We then show how this structure can be leveraged to provide high quality depth maps. Extensive quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed technique yields significantly more precise results than current state of the art, but at a fraction of the computational cost. Our prototype implementation runs at 4000 fps on modern GPU architectures.",

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is the deadliest form of cancer, and early diagnosis is critical to favorable survival rates. Definitive diagnosis of lung cancer typically requires needle biopsy. Common lung nodule biopsy approaches either carry significant risk or are incapable of accessing large regions of the lung, such as in the periphery. Deploying a steerable needle from a bronchoscope and steering through the lung allows for safe biopsy while improving the accessibility of lung nodules in the lung periphery. In this work, we present a method for extracting a cost map automatically from pulmonary CT images, and utilizing the cost map to efficiently plan safe motions for a steerable needle through the lung. The cost map encodes obstacles that should be avoided, such as the lung pleura, bronchial tubes, and large blood vessels, and additionally formulates a cost for the rest of the lung which corresponds to an approximate likelihood that a blood vessel exists at each location in the anatomy. We then present a motion planning approach that utilizes the cost map to generate paths that minimize accumulated cost while safely reaching a goal location in the lung.",

The developed controller is based on a Task-Priority Inverse Kinematics algorithm that allows the manipulator's motion while respecting constraints defined either in the joint or in the operational space in the form of equality-based or set-based tasks. This gives the possibility to define, among the others, tasks as joint-limits, obstacle avoidance or limiting the workspace in the operational space. Additionally, an algorithm for the real-time computation of the minimum distance between the manipulator and other objects in the environment using depth measurements has been implemented, effectively allowing obstacle avoidance tasks. Experiments with a Jaco2 manipulator, operating in an environment where an RGB-D sensor is used for the obstacles detection, show the effectiveness of the developed system.",

We formulate the problem of finding Pareto-optimal trajectories as a problem of sampling trajectories from a Pareto-optimal set. We define an implicit uniform distribution over the Pareto-frontier using a dominance function and then sample in the space of trajectories. The nature of MCMC guarantees the convergence to the Pareto-frontier, while the uniform distribution ensures the diversity of the trajectories. We also propose progressive objective evaluation to increase efficiency in problems with expensive-to-evaluate objective functions. This enables determination of dominance relationship between trajectories before they are entirely evaluated. We finally analyze the effectiveness of the framework and its applications in robotics.",

        "abstract": "The inherent scale ambiguity in monocular vision is a well known issue that forces the integration of other sensory sources to obtain metric references. However, 2D or 3D LiDARs and RGB-D sensors, while guaranteeing metrological accuracy, impose a non negligible burden both in terms of computational load and power requirements limiting the feasibility of being implemented on small exploration vehicles. This paper presents a scale aware monocular Visual Odometry framework that fuses range data from a laser altimeter in order to recover and maintain a correct metric scale. The proposed Visual Odometry method consists of a keyframe based tracking and mapping algorithm using optical flow where range data serves as a scale constraint on a keyframe to keyframe basis. An optimization backend based on iSAM2 is employed in order to refine the trajectory and map estimates eliminating the scale drift without the need of performing loop closures. We demonstrate that our algorithm can obtain very similar performances to state of the art stereo visual SLAM and RGB-D methods.",

Existing approaches, however, are robust only up to about a 3\u00d7 difference in scale between map and query images. We propose a novel combination of deep-learning-based object features and state-of-the-art SIFT point-features that yields improved robustness to scale change. This technique is training-free and class-agnostic, and in principle can be deployed in any environment out-of-the-box. We evaluate the proposed technique on the KITTI Odometry benchmark and on a novel dataset of outdoor images exhibiting changes in visual scale of 7\u00d7 and greater, which we have released to the public. Our technique consistently outperforms localization using either SIFT features or the proposed object features alone, achieving both greater accuracy and much lower failure rates under large changes in scale.",

Recent advances in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) provides dense 3D maps of the environment and the localization is proposed by diverse sensors. Toward the global localization based on the structural information, we propose Scan Context, a non-histogram-based global descriptor from 3D Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) scans. Unlike previously reported methods, the proposed approach directly records a 3D structure of a visible space from a sensor and does not rely on a histogram or on prior training. In addition, this approach proposes the use of a similarity score to calculate the distance between two scan contexts and also a two-phase search algorithm to efficiently detect a loop. Scan context and its search algorithm make loop-detection invariant to LiDAR viewpoint changes so that loops can be detected in places such as reverse revisit and corner. Scan context performance has been evaluated via various benchmark datasets of 3D LiDAR scans, and the proposed method shows a sufficiently improved performance.",

Generally, there is an error accumulation phenomenon during the odometry estimation process. This paper focuses on the method of creating a high quality graph by suggesting ways to improve the graph accuracy since the accumulated errors in the graph might degrade the performance of the entire graph SLAM. We deal with one of our previous works, dynamic keyframe selection technique, based on scan similarity computation method more precisely and suggest a loop closure detection method by exploiting previously proposed 2-D laser scan descriptor. To verify objective performance of the proposed method, the experimental results of the odometry estimation are shown by using the benchmark dataset and the real world dataset. Additionally, results of the pose graph SLAM are shown for the real world dataset which include the loop clorues.",

The framework allows for real-time computation even for horizons of several hundred meters and thus enabling automated driving in urban conditions. This is achieved through several features. Firstly, a convenient geometrical representation of both the search space and driving constraints enables the use of classical path planning approach. Thus, a wide variety of constraints can be tackled simultaneously (other vehicles, traffic lights, etc.). Secondly, an exact cost-to-go map, obtained by solving a relaxed problem, is then used by A*-based algorithm with model predictive flavour in order to compute the optimal motion trajectory. The algorithm takes into account both distance and time horizons. The approach is validated within a simulation study with realistic traffic scenarios. We demonstrate the capability of the algorithm to devise plans both in fast and slow driving conditions, even when full stop is required.",

        "abstract": "As modern robots become more intelligent, also their use will broaden in public and professional areas. While the aim is to make robots beneficial to humans and society, using those complex machines in complex environments will eventually lead to incidents. To enable forensic investigations, ethical evaluations and transparent function of intelligent robots in a society, we contribute the concept of a secure robot data recorder that is similar to a flight data recorder in airplanes. However, since robots work in a highly networked and uncontrolled environment, our concept pays special attention to security and tamper proofness. In addition, we extend the concept with an approach inspired by cockroaches to increase the functional integrity of the robot. We present a prototype implementation along with discussions on the required properties and limits of secure data recording.",

This paper presents a novel bottom-up approach for segmenting symmetric objects and recovering their symmetries from 3D pointclouds of natural scenes. Candidate rotational and reflectional symmetries are detected by fitting symmetry axes/planes to the geometry of the smooth surfaces extracted from the scene. Individual symmetries are used as constraints for the foreground segmentation problem that uses symmetry as a global grouping principle. Evaluation on a challenging dataset shows that our approach can reliably segment objects and extract their symmetries from incomplete 3D reconstructions of highly cluttered scenes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a wide margin.",

        "abstract": "In this work we introduce Natural Segmentation and Matching (NSM), an algorithm for reliable localization, using laser, in both urban and natural environments. Current state-of-the-art global approaches do not generalize well to structure-poor vegetated areas such as forests or orchards. In these environments clutter and perceptual aliasing prevents repeatable extraction of distinctive landmarks between different test runs. In natural forests, tree trunks are not distinctive, foliage intertwines and there is a complete lack of planar structure. In this paper we propose a method for place recognition which uses a more involved feature extraction process which is better suited to this type of environment. First, a feature extraction module segments stable and reliable object-sized segments from a point cloud despite the presence of heavy clutter or tree foliage. Second, repeatable oriented key poses are extracted and matched with a reliable shape descriptor using a Random Forest to estimate the current sensor's position within the target map. We present qualitative and quantitative evaluation on three datasets from different environments - the KITTI benchmark, a parkland scene and a foliage-heavy forest. The experiments show how our approach can achieve place recognition in woodlands while also outperforming current state-of-the-art approaches in urban scenarios without specific tuning.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an approach for segmenting a task consisting of compliant motions into phases, learning a primitive for each segmented phase of the task, and reproducing the task by sequencing primitives online based on the learned model. As compliant motions can \u201cprobe\u201d the environment, using the interaction between the robot and the environment to detect phase transitions can make the transitions less prone to positional errors. This intuition leads us to model a task with a non-homogeneous Hidden Markov Model (HMM), wherein hidden phase transition probabilities depend on the interaction with the environment (wrench measured by an F/T sensor). Expectation-maximization algorithm is employed in estimating the parameters of the HMM model. During reproduction, the phase changes of a task are detected online using the forward algorithm, with the parameters learned from demonstrations. Cartesian impedance controller parameters are learned from the demonstrations to reproduce each phase of the task. The proposed approach is studied with a KUKA LWR4+ arm in two setups. Experiments show that the method can successfully segment and reproduce a task consisting of compliant motions with one or more demonstrations, even when demonstrations do not have the same starting position and external forces occur from different directions. Finally, we demonstrate that the method can also handle rotational motions.",

Infinitesimal shape-similarity describes frameworks for which maintaining the relative angles between robots in formation also maintains the shape up to translation, rotation, and uniform scaling; however, ensuring invariance of the formation to these motions requires that the robots measure a sufficient number of angles, which means that the topology of the frame-work must be carefully designed. In this paper, we investigate the self-assembly of a class of infinitesimally shape-similar frameworks by robots equipped with bearing-only sensors. To accomplish self-assembly, we introduce a rank condition on the shape-similarity matrix for analyzing frameworks; we then use this rank condition to show that triangulations are infinitesimally shape-similar. A graph grammar is presented to assemble triangulations, and a controller is designed to achieve self-assembly of a team of differential-drive robots.",

We contribute to the solution of this problem for the task of road segmentation by proposing an automatic labeling pipeline which leverages a deterministic stereo-based approach for ground plane detection to create large datasets suitable for training neural networks. Based on the popular Cityscapes [1] and KITTI dataset [2] and two off-the-shelf DNNs for semantic segmentation, we show that we can achieve good segmentation results on monocular images, which substantially exceed the performance of the algorithm employed for automatic labeling without the need of any manual annotation.",

Each grid cell contains a semantic label with divers classes, as for instance {Road, Vegetation, Building, Pedestrian, Car...}. We propose a hybrid approach, which combines the advantages of two different methodologies: we use Deep Learning to perform semantic segmentation on monocular RGB images with supervised learning from labeled groundtruth data. We combine these segmentations with occupancy grids calculated from LIDAR data using a generative Bayesian particle filter. The fusion itself is carried out with a deep neural network, which learns to integrate geometric information from the LIDAR with semantic information from the RGB data. We tested our method on two datasets, namely the KITTI dataset, which is publicly available and widely used, and our own dataset obtained with our own platform, equipped with a LIDAR and various sensors. We largely outperform baselines which calculate the semantic grid either from the RGB image alone or from LIDAR output alone, showing the interest of this hybrid approach.",

For our method, called Contextual Temporal Mapping (or CT-Map), we represent the semantic map as a belief over object classes and poses across an observed scene. Inference for the semantic mapping problem is then modeled in the form of a Conditional Random Field (CRF). CT-Map is a CRF that considers two forms of relationship potentials to account for contextual relations between objects and temporal consistency of object poses, as well as a measurement potential on observations. A particle filtering algorithm is then proposed to perform inference in the CT-Map model. We demonstrate the efficacy of the CT-Map method with a Michigan Progress Fetch robot equipped with a RGB-D sensor. Our results demonstrate that the particle filtering based inference of CT-Map provides improved object detection and pose estimation with respect to baseline methods that treat observations as independent samples of a scene.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in monocular SLAM have enabled real-time capable systems which run robustly under the assumption of a static environment, but fail in presence of dynamic scene changes and motion, since they lack an explicit dynamic outlier handling. We propose a semantic monocular SLAM framework designed to deal with highly dynamic environments, combining feature-based and direct approaches to achieve robustness under challenging conditions. The proposed approach exploits semantic information extracted from the scene within an explicit probabilistic model, which maximizes the probability for both tracking and mapping to rely on those scene parts that do not present a relative motion with respect to the camera. We show more stable pose estimation in dynamic environments and comparable performance to the state of the art on static sequences on the Virtual KITTI and Synthia datasets.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Semantic segmentation is a challenging problem that can benefit numerous robotics applications, since it provides information about the content at every image pixel. Solutions to this problem have recently witnessed a boost on performance and results thanks to deep learning approaches. Unfortunately, common deep learning models for semantic segmentation present several challenges which hinder real life applicability in many domains. A significant challenge is the need of pixel level labeling on large amounts of training images to be able to train those models, which implies a very high cost. This work proposes and validates a simple but effective approach to train dense semantic segmentation models from sparsely labeled data. Labeling only a few pixels per image reduces the human interaction required. We find many available datasets, e.g., environment monitoring data, that provide this kind of sparse labeling. Our approach is based on augmenting the sparse annotation to a dense one with the proposed adaptive superpixel segmentation propagation. We show that this label augmentation enables effective learning of state-of-the-art segmentation models, getting similar results to those models trained with dense ground-truth. We demonstrate the applicability of the presented approach to different image modalities in real domains (underwater, aerial and urban scenarios) with publicly available datasets.",

        "abstract": "An understanding of the nature of objects could help robots to solve both high-level abstract tasks and improve performance at lower-level concrete tasks. Although deep learning has facilitated progress in image understanding, a robot's performance in problems like object recognition often depends on the angle from which the object is observed. Traditionally, robot sorting tasks rely on a fixed top-down view of an object. By changing its viewing angle, a robot can select a more semantically informative view leading to better performance for object recognition. In this paper, we introduce the problem of semantic view selection, which seeks to find good camera poses to gain semantic knowledge about an observed object. We propose a conceptual formulation of the problem, together with a solvable relaxation based on clustering. We then present a new image dataset consisting of around 10k images representing various views of 144 objects under different poses. Finally we use this dataset to propose a first solution to the problem by training a neural network to predict a \u201csemantic score\u201d from a top view image and camera pose. The views predicted to have higher scores are then shown to provide better clustering results than fixed top-down views.",

        "abstract": "This work presents Semi-Supervised SLAM - a method for developing a map suitable for coarse localization within an underground environment with minimal human intervention, with system characteristics driven by real-world requirements of major mining companies. This work leverages existing information common within a mining environment - namely a surveyed mine map - which is used to sparsely ground map locations within the mine environment, increasing map accuracy and allowing localization within a global frame. Map creation utilizes a low cost camera sensor and minimal user information to produce a map which can be used for single camera localization within a mining environment. We evaluate the localization capabilities of the proposed approach in depth by performing data collection on operational underground mining vehicles within an active underground mine and by simulating occlusions common to the environment such as dust and water. The proposed system is capable of producing maps which have an average localization error 2.5 times smaller than the next best performing method ORB-SLAM2, comparable localization performance to a state-of-the-art deep learning approach (which is not a feasible solution due to both compute and training requirements) and is robust to simulated environmental obscurants.",

Two barriers to further adoption of robotic threaded fastening systems are system cost and technical challenges, especially for small screws. An affordable intelligent screwdriving system that can support online stage and result classification is the first step to bridge the gap. To this end, starting from a state transition graph of screwdriving processes and a labeled screwdriving dataset (1862 runs of M1.4 screws) on multiple sensor signals, we develop classification algorithms and perform sensor reduction. Fast and accurate result classifiers are developed using linear discriminant analysis, while a wrapper method for feature subset selection is used to identify the optimal feature subset and corresponding sensor signals to reduce cost. A stage classifier based on decision tree is developed using the optimal sensor subset. The stage classifier achieves high accuracy in realtime prediction of various stages when augmented with the state transition graph.",

        "abstract": "Robots have replaced people in many manufacturing production lines but the information they gather from sensors might not be sufficient to autonomously accomplish dexterous manipulation operations. Symbiotic human-robot cooperation appears to be a more realistic near future in industrial scenarios. In this paper we present a configuration of human-robot collaboration in which the robot is sensory-augmented by means of a set of tactile signals coming from the human operator. The incorporation of low-level robot \u201cintelligence\u201d permits the cooperative manipulation of an object while enabling the human operator to stay focused on task itself and carry it out in the most natural way. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in a use case in which a robot helps a human operator to successfully accomplish a writing task. System performance has been evaluated, considering several positions of the tiny vibration sensor in charge of gathering the human perception, by testing it on both the human hand and the co-manipulated object. Results suggest that the sensor provides valuable information for recognizing operator actions when it is placed either on the human hand or on the co-manipulated object. However, the sensor on the finger directly represents the operator's perception, while the output of the sensor attached to the object changes according to the distance between the interaction point and the sensor itself. In addition, in wearing the sensor, neither the object nor the robot need to be instrumented: the operator is free to interact with a large set of objects and collaborate with any existing robot without requiring supplemental equipment.",

        "abstract": "Humans recognize perceived continuous information by dividing it into significant segments such as words and unit motions. We believe that such unsupervised segmentation is also an important ability that robots need to learn topics such as language and motions. Hence, in this paper, we propose a method for dividing continuous time-series data into segments in an unsupervised manner. To this end, we proposed a method based on a hidden semi-Markov model with Gaussian process (GP-HSMM). If Gaussian processes, which are nonparametric models, are used, unit motion patterns can be extracted from complicated continuous motion. However, this approach requires the number of classes of segments in the time-series data in advance. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we extend GP-HSMM to a nonparametric Bayesian model by introducing a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) and propose the hierarchical Dirichlet processes-Gaussian process-hidden semi-Markov model (HDP-GP-HSMM). In the nonparametric Bayesian model, an infinite number of classes is assumed and it becomes difficult to estimate the parameters naively. Instead, the parameters of the proposed HDP-GP-HSMM are estimated by applying slice sampling. In the experiments, we use various synthetic and motion-capture data to show that our proposed model can estimate a more correct number of classes and achieve more accurate segmentation than baseline methods.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The Axel rappelling rover was designed to enable access to intriguing and important science sites that lie in difficult terrains that are inaccessible to conventional rovers. Extended autonomous rappelling calls for careful control of tether tension, precise management of tether spooling, and some measure of shock tolerance. This paper covers the design and testing of a first-generation tether management system (TMS) for Axel. The system uses a double bull-wheel capstan driven by a low-stiffness series elastic actuator (SEA) to provide tension control and decouple internal spooling tension from external tether tension. A series elastic actuator was chosen for this application to permit closed-loop tether tension control and to provide shock/drop tolerance of the rappelling system both while moving and when the system is inactive with the motors locked. Experiments on the new TMS show that this design performs well in keeping nearly constant spooling tension while rejecting large dynamic disturbances at the output. While the SEA is very effective at maintaining a given tension contribution, the additional effects of friction and the unique mechanical properties of the tether result in substantial errors in the measured output tension. Upcoming field trials will be used to evaluate the effectiveness and sufficiency of this system when integrated in Axel.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning is a promising approach to developing hard-to-engineer adaptive solutions for complex and diverse robotic tasks. However, learning with real-world robots is often unreliable and difficult, which resulted in their low adoption in reinforcement learning research. This difficulty is worsened by the lack of guidelines for setting up learning tasks with robots. In this work, we develop a learning task with a UR5 robotic arm to bring to light some key elements of a task setup and study their contributions to the challenges with robots11Source code of the task and the computational model behind the setup available at https://github.com/kindredresearch/SenseAct. We find that learning performance can be highly sensitive to the setup, and thus oversights and omissions in setup details can make effective learning, reproducibility, and fair comparison hard. Our study suggests some mitigating steps to help future experimenters avoid difficulties and pitfalls. We show that highly reliable and repeatable experiments can be performed in our setup, indicating the possibility of reinforcement learning research extensively based on real-world robots.",

One of the applications of such exoskeleton is to protect a pilot of a personal vertical mobility system, or JetPack, when landing. The shock absorbing exoskeleton is to introduce series and parallel viscoelasticity to the human skeletal system. The paper presents a pilot study to validate this body-protective exoskeleton concept by analyzing kinematic and dynamic models of a human-exoskeleton coupled system based on a multi-element viscoelastic model in rheology. A proof-of-concept prototype is developed and experimental data is presented.",

Let's assume the drones only can communicate to their neighbors and manage partial information of the mission. A relevant question in this scenario is \u201cShould the robots compete or should they cooperate?\u201d. This work analyzes the described scenario to answer this question. Two game theoretical algorithms have been developed: one competitive and another cooperative. The competitive algorithm poses games among each drone and its neighbors and searches the Nash Equilibrium. The cooperative one defines electoral systems that allow the drones to vote their preferred task allocations for their neighbors. Both algorithms are extensively tested in multiple scenarios with different features. After the experiments the question can be answered \u201cThe robots should cooperate!\u201d.",

Our results suggest that whereas communicating through a physically embodied medium potentially induces a significantly higher pattern of brain activation with respect to video-chat and speaker, its difference is non-significant in comparison with in-person communication. These results imply that communicating through a humanoid robot induces a pattern of brain activity in older people that is potentially similar to in-person communication. Our findings benefit researchers and practitioners in rehabilitation and elderly care facilities in search of effective means of communication with their patients to increase their involvement in the incremental steps of their treatments. Moreover, they imply the utility of brain information as a promising sensory gateway in characterization of the behavioural responses in human-robot interaction.",

The diversity of products that are available in stores and the different setups and preferences of each store makes pre-programming a robot for this task extremely challenging. Instead, our work argues for enabling end-users to customize the robot to their specific objects and setup at deployment time by programming it themselves. To that end, this paper contributes (i) a task representation for shelf arrangements based on a large dataset of grocery store shelf images, (ii) a method for inferring goal configurations from user inputs including demonstrations and direct parameter specifications, and (iii) a system implementation of the proposed approach that allows simultaneously learning task goals and actions. We evaluate our goal inference approach with ten different teaching strategies that combine alternative user inputs in different ways on the large dataset of grocery configurations, as well as with real human teachers through an online user study (N=32). We evaluate our full system implemented on a Fetch mobile manipulator on eight benchmark tasks that demonstrate end-to-end programming and execution of shelf arrangement tasks.",

Task allocation is performed simultaneously with planning, which provides more detailed information about individual robot behaviour, but also exploits independence between tasks to do so efficiently. We use Markov decision processes to model robot behaviour and linear temporal logic to specify tasks and safety constraints. Building upon techniques and tools from formal verification, we show how to generate a sequence of multi-robot policies, iteratively refining them to reallocate tasks if individual robots fail, and providing probabilistic guarantees on the performance (and safe operation) of the team of robots under the resulting policy. We implement our approach and evaluate it on a benchmark multi-robot example.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes the utilization of sinc functions as kernels of Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) models for encoding point-to-point kinematic behaviors. The proposed method presents a number of advantages with respect to the state of the art, as it (i) involves a simple learning technique, (ii) provides a method to determine the minimum required number of basis functions, based on the frequency content of the demonstrated motion and (iii) provides the ability to pre-define the reproduction accuracy of the learned behavior. The ability of the proposed model to accurately reproduce the behavior is demonstrated through simulations and experiments. Comparisons with the Gaussian-based DMP model show the proposed method's superiority in terms of computational complexity of learning and accuracy for a specific number of kernels.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a mixed-integer convex programming formulation for dynamic motion planning. Many dynamic constraints such as the actuator torque constraint are nonlinear and non-convex due to the trigonometrical terms from the Jacobian matrix. This often causes the optimization problem to converge to local optima or even infeasible set. In this paper, we convexify the torque constraint by formulating a mixed-integer quadratically-constrained program (MIQCP). More specifically, the workspace is discretized into a union of disjoint polytopes and torque constraint is enforced upon a convex outer approximation of the torque ellipsoid, obtained by solving a semidefinite program (SDP). Bilinear terms are approximated by McCormick envelope convex relaxation. The proposed MIQCP framework could be solved efficiently to global optimum and the generated trajectories could exploit the rich features of the rough terrain without any initial guess from the designer. The demonstrated experiment results prove that this approach is currently capable of planning consecutive jumps that navigates a single-legged robot through challenging terrains.",

Object identification is of paramount importance in robotics applications, as it facilitates autonomous object handling, sorting, and quality inspection. In this paper, we present a new hyper-adaptive robot hand that is capable of discriminating between different everyday objects, as well as `model' objects with the same external geometry but varying material, density, or volume, with a single grasp. This work leverages all the benefits of simple, adaptive grasping mechanisms (robustness, simplicity, low weight, adaptability), a Random Forests classifier, tactile modules based on barometric sensors, and radar technology offered by the Google Soli sensor. Unlike prior work, the method does not rely on object exploration, object release or re-grasping and works for a wide variety of everyday objects. The feature space used consists of the Google Soli readings, the motor positions and the contact forces measured at different time instances of the grasping process. The whole approach is model-free and the hand is controlled in an open-loop fashion, achieving stable grasps with minimal complexity. The efficiency of the designs, sensors, and methods has been experimentally validated with experimental paradigms involving model and everyday objects.",

In this work, we present a framework for effectively grounding situated and naturalistic speech to action selection during human-robot collaborative activities. This is accomplished by maintaining and incrementally updating separate \u201cspeech\u201d and \u201ccontext\u201d models that jointly classify a collaborator's utterance. We evaluate the efficacy of the system on a collaborative construction task with an autonomous robot and human participants. We first demonstrate that our system is capable of acquiring and deploying new task representations from limited and naturalistic data sets, and without any prior domain knowledge of language or the task itself. Finally, we show that our system is capable of significantly improving performance on an unfamiliar task after a one-shot exposure.",

The combination of both locomotion domains overcomes the trade-off between mobility and efficiency. Therefore, this paper presents a novel motion planner and controller which together enable a legged robot equipped with skates to perform skating maneuvers. These are achieved by an appropriate combination of planned reaction forces and gliding motions. Our novel motion controller formulates a Virtual Model Controller and an optimal contact force distribution which takes into account the nonholonomic constraints introduced by the skates. This approach has been tested on the torque-controllable robot ANY mal equipped with passive wheels and ice skates as end-effectors. We conducted experiments on flat and inclined terrain, whereby we show that skating motions reduces the cost of transport by up to 80 % with respect to traditional walking gaits.",

        "abstract": "Continuum robots that move through undulatory actuation must be composed of body materials that can enable flexible movement yet also provide resistive forces to the surrounding fluid, granular, or solid environments. This need for \u201cf1exible-yet-stiff\u201d materials is notably important in robot designs that use passive propulsive elements such as tails and wings. Here we explore a laminate design paradigm for \u201cf1exible-yet-stiff\u201d robotic materials through sliding layer laminates (SLLs). We present design principles motivated by theory and experiment and illustrate a taxonomy of SLL enabled morphable materials capable of up to 7 fold change in stiffness. Lastly, we demonstrate the applicability of SLLs to undulatory continuum robots: a swimming robot with a passive tail. We target two desired robot locomotor behaviors: fast open water swimming, and steady swimming through narrow channels emulating underwater caverns and pipes. We demonstrate how tuning the stiffness of the robot tail maximizes thrust generation in these two locomotion modes. Soft tails are optimal in confined swimming because they generate short amplitude high wavenumber oscillations, while stiff tails in confined environments either collide with the walls or do not generate sufficient thrust. However, stiff tails are far better in unconfined environments which enable large stroke amplitudes requiring high stiffness. Through this demonstration we show that stiff or soft tail designs alone are incapable of effective locomotion in complex underwater environments challenge.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In multi-finger or multi-arm grasping with friction contacts, maintaining force closure during motion is critical. Violation of this condition would cause contact slippage and possibly loss of grasp. This issue is of particular importance in space robotics, where the loss of grasp could lead to catastrophic consequences. There has been ample literature on stable grasp and force closure under static conditions. This paper investigates multi-arm grasping during motion, where the inertial force from the load could adversely affect grasp stability. Our approach dynamically adjusts the squeeze force and commanded robot/load motion to maintain a safe force closure condition. For a specified motion trajectory, the squeeze force is updated to prevent slippage based on the estimated inertial force. When the required squeeze force is beyond what the manipulators can safely apply, the trajectory will be scaled to reduce the inertial force component. In addition to motion-induced disturbance force, contact between the load and other objects in the environment can also cause slippage. The slip prevention strategy is extended to this case as well. The application scenario is based on the dual-arm transportation and berthing of a load in a micro-gravity environment. For laboratory testing, we use a fixed-base dual-arm robot to grasp, transport, and berth an object on a planar air bearing table. We also extend the transportation tests to a more general spatial setting, and use the dynamic squeeze adjustment to grasp, lift, and transport an object. Experimental results show the proposed method is effective at avoiding contact slippage during motion and when the object is in contact with the environment.",

It is used e.g. in the context of pose estimation and self-localization of planetary rovers, which is a crucial part of the success of planetary exploration missions. Depending on the wheel-soil interaction properties, wheel odometry measurements are subject to inherent errors such as wheel slippage. In this paper, a parameter-based approach for whole-body slip modeling and calibration is applied to a four-wheeled lightweight rover system. Details on the method for slip parameter calibration as well as the system-specific implementation are given. Experimental results from a test campaign on Mt. Etna are presented, showing significant improvements of the resulting wheel odometry measurements. The results are validated during a long range drive of approx. 900 m and discussed w. r. t. the advantages but also limitations of the method within a space exploration scenario.",

The latter property makes our approach also suited for 4th order dynamics flexible joint robots, which gained significant practical relevance recently. In particular, we address the problem of generating a smooth, kinematically nearly time-optimal SE(3) trajectory while simultaneously avoiding potential collisions of the robot end-effector with its base as well as respecting the Cartesian unreachable states induced by the joint limits of the proximal kinematic structure.",

        "abstract": "Despite being one of the most robust methods in bilateral teleoperation, Time Domain Passivity Approach (TDPA)presents the drawback of accumulating position drift between master and slave devices. The lack of position synchronization poses an obstacle to the performance of teleoperation and may prevent the successful accomplishment of such tasks. Several techniques have been developed in order to solve the position-drift problem in TDPA-based teleoperation. However, they either present poor transparency by over-conservatively constraining force feedback or add high impulse-like force signals that can be harmful to the hardware and to the human operator. We propose a new approach to compensate position drift in TDPA-based teleoperation in a smoother way, which keeps the forces within the normal range of the teleoperation task while preserving the level of transparency and the robust stability of energy-based TDPA. We also add a way of tuning the compensator to behave in accordance with the task being performed, whether it requires faster or smoother compensation. The feasibility and performance of the method were experimentally validated. Good position tracking and regular-amplitude forces are demonstrated with up to 500 ms round-trip constant and variable delays for hard-wall contacts.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous cars can perform poorly for many reasons. They may have perception issues, incorrect dynamics models, be unaware of obscure rules of human traffic systems, or follow certain rules too conservatively. Regardless of the exact failure mode of the car, often human drivers around the car are behaving correctly. For example, even if the car does not know that it should pull over when an ambulance races by, other humans on the road will know and will pull over. We propose to make socially cohesive cars that leverage the behavior of nearby human drivers to act in ways that are safer and more socially acceptable. The simple intuition behind our algorithm is that if all the humans are consistently behaving in a particular way, then the autonomous car probably should too. We analyze the performance of our algorithm in a variety of scenarios and conduct a user study to assess people's attitudes towards socially cohesive cars. We find that people are surprisingly tolerant of mistakes that cohesive cars might make in order to get the benefits of driving in a car with a safer, or even just more socially acceptable behavior.",

        "abstract": "People engage in social coordination without explicitly communicating when they are conflicting over spatial resources, e.g., a shop clerk who yields to customers the best place to view products. In this study, we proposed a method that achieves such social coordination with a robot. Our idea is that the social coordination between two agents can be represented as utility-maximizing behavior for joint utility rather than just by a single agent utility. That is, given that each agent's reasonable behavior can be represented as utility-maximizing behavior for single agent utility, we model each agent's plans for himself as well as for the partner agent. Moreover, superiority relationships exist in this joint-utility computation. Since each agent knows such superiority relationships, social coordination can be modeled as utility-yielding behavior based on informed superiority. We specifically focus on looking-together situations for which we developed a utility model. With simulations, we investigate whether the above joint-utility-based modeling successfully reproduces social coordination in looking-together situations. We conducted an experiment in a situation where a tele-operated robot and a customer together look at products in a shop environment. Our experimental results show that our proposed method enables the robot to socially coordinate spatial resources, yielding significantly more thoughtful, less-self-centered, and appropriate impressions than the alternate robot.",

        "abstract": "For socially assistive robots (SAR)to be accepted into complex and stochastic human environments, it is important to account for subtle social norms. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to socially-aware navigation (SAN)which garnered an immense interest in the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)community. We use a multi-objective optimization tool called the Pareto Concavity Elimination Transformation (PaC-cET)to capture the non-linear human navigation behavior, a novel contribution to the community. A candidate point on a trajectory is scored (1)for its progress towards the goal, and (2)based on autonomously-sensed distance-based features that capture the social norms and associated social costs. Rather than use a finely-tuned linear combination of these costs, we use PaCcET to select an optimized future trajectory point, associated with a non-linear combination of the costs. Existing research in this domain concentrates on geometric reasoning, model-based, and learning approaches, which have their own pros and cons. This approach is distinct from prior work in this area. We showed in a simulation that the PaCcET-based trajectory planner not only is able to avoid collisions and reach the intended destination in static and dynamic environments but also considers a human's personal space i.e. rules of proxemics in the trajectory selection process.",

It consists of a very complex mechanical structure that enables the hand to adapt and efficiently handle objects of various shapes, weights and textures. Today's prosthetic devices, struggling to provide similar functions, become overly complex and expensive. They are composed of multiple, precise parts, including miniaturised actuators and sensors as well as complex control, to satisfy the manipulation tasks required. In this paper we propose a soft pneumatic hand that adapts passively to the handled object due to its mechanical compliance. It is pressure driven and enables individual fingers to be controlled independently for dexterity or in groups when a synergistic finger movement is needed. The hand has a truly anatomical shape, is easy to replace and cheap in production. The design can be easily adjusted in terms of shape and size in order to fit each individual user. The paper presents the design, manufacturing technology, current control system and preliminary tests of the hand's capabilities.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we show that sensors based on soft, intentionally-lossy optical waveguides are well-suited for soft robotic grasping applications in the deep-sea. Each finger of a soft robotic hand is outfitted with a 2\u00d71 array of optical sensing elements to enable proprioception and contact force sensing. Curvature sensing elements are integrated directly into the structure of a finger, while contact force sensors are fabricated as standalone units and attached afterward. Along with considerations for interfacing with deep-sea remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), models for the effect of bending on light loss and the effect of normal force on strain were used to inform sensor design decisions. Our sensors show sensitivity to curvature over a range of diameters from 8 mm to 76 mm, and sub-Newton force sensitivity. Additionally, sensors were characterized in simulated deep-sea environments at temperatures from -10\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C and hydrostatic pressures up to 4000 psi. The sensitivity of our curvature sensors is invariant to the temperatures and pressure ranges tested, though contact force sensors decreased in sensitivity as temperatures decreased. Finally, we successfully demonstrate that sensors onboard soft finger actuators can provide informative state feedback during grasping operations in air and water.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a fabric actuator consisting of ordinary polymer fibers, conductive fibers, and twisted and coiled soft actuators (TCAs). Previous studies have developed a Spandex TCA (STCA) that is driven at a lower temperature than the conventional Nylon TCA and exhibits greater actuation strain. However, no method to drive STCAs via electrical joule-heating has been developed yet. The fabric actuator presented in this paper offers a solution to this problem by employing an STCA multiple fabrication method, a continuous fabrication method, bundling technology, and weaving technology. Two types of samples (cylindrical and planar) are fabricated and their performances are evaluated experimentally. From the actuation test according to the loads, the maximum contraction strain of 34.3% is measured. The repeatability is also verified through 200 cycles of actuation. Using a linearized model, the dynamic performance of the fabric actuator is predicted and compared with experimental results. An actual human arm size mannequin is driven by applying the fabric actuator, and angle control can be achieved with an encoder mounted on the joint. In addition, fabric actuator is weaved to sweater showing the possibility of wearable assistive robot.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces soft LEGO for bottom-up design platform of soft robotics that can be used for various purposes, ranging from research and fast prototyping of soft robots to toys and entertainment. We integrated the interlocking mechanism of LEGO into a modular soft robot. With this design, soft robots could be built by a simple and play-like assembling process. Three kinds of components were proposed to make soft robotics compatible with LEGO: pneumatically inflatable soft brick, flexible bending brick, and channel brick. The soft brick has an air chamber and can generate motions when inflated. The bending brick has flexure and is bendable for generating motion when the assembled soft bricks are pneumatically actuated. The air channel brick has an air channel inside and works as an interface between air hoses and soft LEGO bricks. Detailed design parameters of the soft brick were optimized based on the Taguchi method with finite-element analysis to improve robustness. Design of the bending brick was selected based on experimental results to enhance the robustness of the flexure. Thanks to the multi-material 3-dimensional printer, the soft LEGO bricks could be fabricated with a single printing process. To see the feasibility of soft LEGO as a bottom-up design platform, a simple toy robot for children and a gripper that had a hybrid mechanism of hard and soft materials were built and tested. We hope this soft LEGO could lower the hurdle of soft robotics for children, researchers from other fields, and the public interest in robotics.",

        "abstract": "Mobile robots of all shapes and sizes move through the air, water, and over ground. However, few robots can move through the ground. Not only are the forces resisting movement much greater than in air or water, but the interaction forces are more complicated. Here we propose a soft robotic device that burrows through dry sand while requiring an order of magnitude less force than a similarly sized intruding body. The device leverages the principles of both tip-extension and granular fluidization. Like roots, the device extends from its tip; the principle of tip-extension eliminates skin drag on the sides of the body, because the body is stationary with respect to the medium. We implement this with an everting, pressure-driven thin film body. The second principle, granular fluidization, enables a granular medium to adopt a dynamic fluid-like state when pressurized fluid is passed through it, reducing the forces acting on an object moving through it. We realize granular fluidization with a flow of air through the core of the body that mixes with the medium at the tip. The proposed device could lead to applications such as search and rescue in mudslides or shallow subterranean exploration. Further, because it creates a physical conduit with its body, electrical lines, fluids, or even tools could be passed through this channel.",

        "abstract": "Compliant materials used to create soft robots can better replicate biological structures than typical rigid materials. We can look to nature for developing locomotion strategies for these soft-bodied robots. In this work, snakes were used as inspiration to create an inextensible, soft robot which was used as a platform to test gaits in terrain composed of granular media ranging from fine sand to stone. Snakes vary the speed and amplitude of the traveling wave used in lateral undulation to navigate different environments. We used these gait parameters to develop and test a set of custom gaits that varied the phase offset of the sequence of waves as well as using the best performing gait to test how the amplitude of the wave effects locomotion over the selected terrains. These tests provide preliminary evidence that altering these parameters effects the robot's ability to traverse different terrains. The developed robot is also tested in environments specific to applications for snake robots to show how a soft snake robot can be potentially more effective in these environment. The highest performing gait-curvature combination was the half-activation gait (where the back actuator was activated half as long as the front)with a 135\u00b0 swept angle. It reached a velocity of 2.2 mm/s or 0.011 body-lengths/s on paper, which was the best performing terrain.",

        "abstract": "Compressing soft-obstacles secondary to a controlled motion task is common for human beings. While these tasks are nearly trivial for teleoperated robots, they remain a challenging problem in robotic autonomy. Addressing the problem is significant. For example, in Minimally Invasive Surgeries (MISs), safely compressing soft tissues ensures the surgical safety and decreases tissue removal, thus dramatically decreases surgical trauma and operating room time, and leads to improved surgical outcomes. In this work, we define the problem of soft-obstacle avoidance and project the safety motion constraints into the task space and the velocity space. We illustrate the significance of addressing this problem in the robotic surgery scenario. We present a Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) based solution, which formulates the problem as an inequality constrained optimization problem and solves it in its dual space. The application of the proposed method was demonstrated in the Raven II surgical robot. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method is effective in addressing the soft-obstacle avoidance problem.",

        "abstract": "A new mechanism for efficiently solving the Markov decision processes (MDPs) is proposed in this paper. We introduce the notion of reachability landscape where we use the Mean First Passage Time (MFPT) as a means to characterize the reachability of every state in the state space. We show that such reachability characterization very well assesses the importance of states and thus provides a natural basis for effectively prioritizing states and approximating policies. Built on such a novel observation, we design two new algorithms - Mean First Passage Time based Value Iteration (MFPT-VI) and Mean First Passage Time based Policy Iteration (MFPT-PI) - that have been modified from the state-of-the-art solution methods. To validate our design, we have performed numerical evaluations in robotic decision-making scenarios, by comparing the proposed new methods with corresponding classic baseline mechanisms. The evaluation results showed that MFPT-VI and MFPT-PI have outperformed the state-of-the-art solutions in terms of both practical runtime and number of iterations. Aside from the advantage of fast convergence, this new solution method is intuitively easy to understand and practically simple to implement.",

In this paper, we take maps built from noisy sensor data and construct a sparse graph containing topological information that can be used for 3D planning. We use a Euclidean Signed Distance Field, extract a 3D Generalized Voronoi Diagram (GVD), and obtain a thin skeleton diagram representing the topological structure of the environment. We then convert this skeleton diagram into a sparse graph, which we show is resistant to noise and changes in resolution. We demonstrate global planning over this graph, and the orders of magnitude speed-up it offers over other common planning methods. We validate our planning algorithm in real maps built onboard an MAV, using RGB-D sensing.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Latest deep learning methods for object detection provide remarkable performance, but have limits when used in robotic applications. One of the most relevant issues is the long training time, which is due to the large size and imbalance of the associated training sets, characterized by few positive and a large number of negative examples (i.e. background). Proposed approaches are based on end-to-end learning by back-propagation [22] or kernel methods trained with Hard Negatives Mining on top of deep features [8]. These solutions are effective, but prohibitively slow for on-line applications. In this paper we propose a novel pipeline for object detection that overcomes this problem and provides comparable performance, with a 60x training speedup. Our pipeline combines (i) the Region Proposal Network and the deep feature extractor from [22] to efficiently select candidate RoIs and encode them into powerful representations, with (ii) the FALKON [23] algorithm, a novel kernel-based method that allows fast training on large scale problems (millions of points). We address the size and imbalance of training data by exploiting the stochastic subsampling intrinsic into the method and a novel, fast, bootstrapping approach. We assess the effectiveness of the approach on a standard Computer Vision dataset (PASCAL VOC 2007 [5]) and demonstrate its applicability to a real robotic scenario with the iCubWorld Transformations [18] dataset.",

        "abstract": "Place recognition is one of the major challenges for the LiDAR-based effective localization and mapping task. Traditional methods are usually relying on geometry matching to achieve place recognition, where a global geometry map need to be restored. In this paper, we accomplish the place recognition task based on an end-to-end feature learning framework with the LiDAR inputs. This method consists of two core modules, a dynamic octree mapping module that generates local 2D maps with the consideration of the robot's motion; and an unsupervised place feature learning module which is an improved adversarial feature learning network with additional assistance for the long-term place recognition requirement. More specially, in place feature learning, we present an additional Generative Adversarial Network with a designed Conditional Entropy Reduction module to stabilize the feature learning process in an unsupervised manner. We evaluate the proposed method on the Kitti dataset and North Campus Long-Term LiDAR dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art in place recognition tasks under long-term applications. What's more, the feature size and inference efficiency in the proposed method are applicable in real-time performance on practical robotic platforms.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a complete motion planning approach for quadruped locomotion across an unknown terrain using a framework based on mixed-integer convex optimization and visual feedback. Vision data is used to find convex polygons in the surrounding environment, which acts as potentially feasible foothold regions. Then, a goal position is initially provided, which the best feasible destination planner uses to solve for an actual feasible goal position based on the extracted polygons. Next, a footstep planner uses the feasible goal position to plan a fixed number of footsteps, which may or may not result in the robot reaching the position. The center of mass (COM) trajectory planner using quadratic programming is extended to solve for a trajectory in 3D space while maintaining convexity, which reduces the computation time, allowing the robot to plan and execute motions online. The suggested method is implemented as a policy rather than a path planner, but its performance as a path planner is also shown. The approach is verified on both simulation and on a physical robot, ALPHRED, walking on various unknown terrains.",

        "abstract": "Soft robotic structures might play a major role in the 4th industrial revolution. Researchers have successfully demonstrated advantages of soft robotics over traditional robots made of rigid links and joints in several application areas including manufacturing, healthcare and surgical interventions. However, soft robots have limited ability to exert higher forces when it comes to interaction with the environment, hence, change their stiffness on demand over a wide range. One stiffness mechanism embodies tendon-driven and pneumatic air actuation in an antagonistic way achieving variable stiffness values. In this paper, we apply a beam-mechanics-based model to this type of soft stiffness controllable robot. This mathematical model takes into account the various stiffness levels of the soft robotic manipulator as well as interaction forces with the environment at the tip of the manipulator. The analytical model is implemented into a robotic actuation system made of motorised linear rails with load cells (obtaining applied forces to the tendons) and a pressure regulator. Here, we present and analyse the performance and limitations of our model.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel steerable locomotion controller for six-strut tensegrity robots. Tensegrity robots are lightweight and have many promising features such as robustness, shape-shifting capabilities, and deployability, making them good candidates for exploration and scouting of remote areas. Despite these advantages, tensegrity robots are challenging to control due to their large number of degrees of freedom, nonlinear dynamics, and intrinsic compliance. Recently, many step-wise motion controllers have been employed to simplify the locomotion problem, thanks to the discrete nature of the tensegrity structure. In this paper we present a novel locomotion controller which will steer the direction of motion of a six-strut tensegrity robot when used in conjunction with any preexisting step-wise controller. We validated our controller on the SUPERball v2 robot, showing straight and curved trajectories, and an example of navigation around obstacles. Our method is computationally inexpensive, only requires knowledge about the current base triangle (e.g, via accelerometer data), and can be generalized to any six-strut tensegrity robot which can perform step-wise locomotion.",

        "abstract": "This paper analyzes and implements two novel turning strategies for underactuated legged robots that leverage contact of an active tail against terrain. The first strategy produces a sustained turn with a tail dragging against the ground during forward locomotion. The second strategy produces a rapid point turn by impacting the tail against the ground. LoadRoACH, a 55 g palm-sized legged robot, is developed to carry the active tail payload used in turning experiments. A steady-state turning model predicts the achievable turn speed of the robot on carpet, and open-loop turning experiments characterize the performance of the two tail contact turning strategies. Tail drag turning provides comparable turning maneuverability to differential drive turning gaits on carpet and gravel surfaces. Tail impact turning can produce rapid point turns on carpet, tarp, and gravel, but has a large variability in turn angle and time to recover from the turn. Finally, tail drag and tail impact turning control methods are implemented in an aggressive closed-loop corner steering maneuver.",

        "abstract": "As simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques have flourished with the advent of 3D Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, accurate 3D maps are readily available. Many researchers turn their attention to localization in a previously acquired 3D map. In this paper, we propose a novel and lightweight camera-only visual positioning algorithm that involves localization within prior 3D LiDAR maps. We aim to achieve the consumer level global positioning system (GPS) accuracy using vision within the urban environment, where GPS signal is unreliable. Via exploiting a stereo camera, depth from the stereo disparity map is matched with 3D LiDAR maps. A full six degree of freedom (DOF) camera pose is estimated via minimizing depth residual. Powered by visual tracking that provides a good initial guess for the localization, the proposed depth residual is successfully applied for camera pose estimation. Our method runs online, as the average localization error is comparable to ones resulting from state-of-the-art approaches. We validate the proposed method as a stand-alone localizer using KITTI dataset and as a module in the SLAM framework using our own dataset.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a particle filter localization approach, based on stereo visual odometry (VO) and semantic information from indoor environments, for mini-aerial robots. The prediction stage of the particle filter is performed using the 3D pose of the aerial robot estimated by the stereo VO algorithm. This predicted 3D pose is updated using inertial as well as semantic measurements. The algorithm processes semantic measurements in two phases; firstly, a pre-trained deep learning (DL) based object detector is used for real time object detections in the RGB spectrum. Secondly, from the corresponding 3D point clouds of the detected objects, we segment their dominant horizontal plane and estimate their relative position, also augmenting a prior map with new detections. The augmented map is then used in order to obtain a drift free pose estimate of the aerial robot. We validate our approach in several real flight experiments where we compare it against ground truth and a state of the art visual SLAM approach.",

By representing vehicle paths using a novel action space representation, rather than a state space representation, we remove the need to perform feasibility calculations on the vehicle's path. Our algorithm uses a stochastic optimization scheme by sampling perturbed action sequences around the current best known sequence to estimate the gradient of a state space information function with respect to the action sequence. Additionally, we use sequential greedy allocation to plan for multiple vehicles. Results are shown using a Navy Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM) for the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). SGA shows improvement in the amount of information gained over a greedy baseline. Additionally, we compare to Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Method, which is able to gather competitive amounts of information but is more computationally intensive than our approach.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a multi-link articulated wheeled in-pipe robot that can drive the wheel and roll joint by using only a single actuator installed in each link. The proposed mechanism enables the robot to move forward or backward and helically in pipes owing to rotation of the drive wheel and twisting of the body. These two movements are generated by a miter-geared differential mechanism installed in each joint, and the magnitudes of these movements depend on the load applied to the wheels and roll joints. However, controlling of two outputs independently and aligning the rotation of the roll joints as desired are extremely challenging. Therefore, in this study, we switch those two movements by driving the rear wheels and the front wheels of the robot alternately. In addition, a stopper is used to constrain the roll joint movement. By calculating the angle of elevation of the robot's helical movement in the pipe by using a kinematic model, we can design a stopper to precisely adjust the roll angle. We verified that the robot can twist using the differential mechanism, and we validated experimentally the effectiveness of the stopper.",

        "abstract": "In challenging environments where human intervention is expensive, robust and persistent autonomy is a key requirement. AI Planners can efficiently construct plans to achieve this long-term autonomous behaviour. However, in plans which are expected to last over days, or even weeks, the size of the state-space becomes too large for current planners to solve as a single problem. These problems are well-suited to decomposition and abstraction planning techniques. We present a novel approach in the context of persistent autonomy in autonomous underwater vehicles, in which tasks are complex and diverse and plans cannot be precomputed. Our approach performs a decomposition into a two-level hierarchical structure, which dynamically constructs planning problems at the upper level of the hierarchy using solution plans from the lower level. Solution plans are then executed and monitored simultaneously at both levels. We evaluate the approach, showing that compared to strictly top-down hierarchical decompositions, our approach leads to more robust solution plans of higher quality.",

The robot has a downward-facing camera, and works on a variety of ground textures including general texture like tarmac, man-made designs like carpet, and rectilinear textures like indoor tiles or outdoor slabs. Such textures provide a basis for measuring relative motion (i.e. computer mouse functionality). But the goal here is the more challenging one of absolute localization. The paper describes a complete working pipeline to build a globally consistent map of a given ground-plane and subsequently to localize within this map at real-time. Two algorithms are described. The first is a feature-based approach which is general to any ground plane texture. The second algorithm takes advantage of the extra constraints available for common rectilinear textures like indoor tiling, paving slabs, and laid brickwork. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results are shown for mapping and localization on a variety of ground-planes.",

Balancing on multiple contacts requires to solve the force distribution problem. In locomotion, contacts change quickly, requiring a swift redistribution of contact forces. This is a challenge for elastic robots as the actuator dynamics and limits prevent instantaneous changes of contact forces. The proposed dynamically consistent force distribution is implemented as a model predictive controller which resolves redundancy while complying with contact force and actuator constraints.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The model produced by 3D reconstruction algorithm is usually represented by voxels. The management of these voxels is usually divided into two categories: ordered and unordered methods. The ordered method holds too many empty voxels to maintain data order which leads to a low storage efficiency. On the contrary, the unordered method keeps massive index data to only store nonempty voxels. In this paper, we design a new data management method for real-time indoor 3D reconstruction, called Structured Skip List (SSL). The SSL can be treated as a semi-ordered method, because the advantages of both the ordered and unordered methods are taken into account: 1) it only holds nonempty voxels similar to the unordered method; 2) the structured information is introduced to reduce the storage space of index data. By these designs, the SSL has a better performance on storage efficiency. To handle the data collision in voxel allocation, a hash allocation list (HAL) is proposed. The length of each Skip List is kept balanced by fusing the IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) information for a high operation efficiency. The storage efficiency analysis of different data management methods is shown in this paper. What's more, exhaustive investigation is carried out on several datasets with these methods. The experimental result demonstrates that our design can achieve a high storage efficiency with little time loss compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

Our system uses a submap back-end and a visual front-end. The main advantage of our system is its robustness with respect to tracking failure, a common problem in current VSLAM algorithms. The robustness of our system is compared with the state-of-the-art in terms of average tracking percentage. The precision of our system is also evaluated in terms of ATE (absolute trajectory error) RMSE (root mean square error) comparing the state-of-the-art. The ability of our system in solving the \u201ckidnapped\u201d problem is demonstrated. Our system can improve the robustness of visual localization in challenging situations.",

        "abstract": "Recent progress in 3D sensor devices and in semantic mapping allows to build very rich HD 3D maps very useful for autonomous navigation and localization. However, these maps are particularly huge and require important memory capabilities as well computational resources. In this paper, we propose a new method for summarizing a 3D map (Mesh)as a set of compact spheres in order to facilitate its use by systems with limited resources (smartphones, robots, UAVs,...). This vision-based summarizing process is applied in a fully automatic way using jointly photometric, geometric and semantic information of the studied environment. The main contribution of this research is to provide a very compact map that maximizes the significance of its content while maintaining the full visibility of the environment. Experimental results in summarizing large-scale 3D map demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and evaluate the performance of the algorithm.",

Since the tasks are mostly unknown in advance, the robot has to adapt to a wide variety of terrains and workspaces during a mission. The centaur-like robot Centauro has a hybrid legged-wheeled base and an anthropomorphic upper body to carry out complex tasks in environments too dangerous for humans. Due to its high number of degrees of freedom, controlling the robot with direct teleoperation approaches is challenging and exhausting. Supervised autonomy approaches are promising to increase quality and speed of control while keeping the flexibility to solve unknown tasks. We developed a set of operator assistance functionalities with different levels of autonomy to control the robot for challenging locomotion and manipulation tasks. The integrated system was evaluated in disaster response scenarios and showed promising performance.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel interaction strategy for a human-swarm communication when a human operator guides a formation of quadrotors with impedance control and receives vibrotactile feedback. The presented approach takes into account the human hand velocity and changes the formation shape and dynamics accordingly using impedance interlinks simulated between quadrotors, which helps to achieve a life-like swarm behavior. Experimental results with Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotor platform validate the proposed control algorithm. The tactile patterns representing dynamics of the swarm (extension or contraction) are proposed. The user feels the state of the swarm at his fingertips and receives valuable information to improve the controllability of the complex life-like formation. The user study revealed the patterns with high recognition rates. Subjects stated that tactile sensation improves the ability to guide the drone formation and makes the human-swarm communication much more interactive. The proposed technology can potentially have a strong impact on the human-swarm interaction, providing a new level of intuitiveness and immersion into the swarm navigation.",

The algorithm follows the model-based reinforcement learning paradigm and improves upon existing algorithms: PILeO and a sample-based version of PILeo with neural network dynamics (Deep-PILeO). To improve convergence, we propose a model-based algorithm that uses fixed random numbers and clips gradients during optimization. We propose training a neural network dynamics model using variational dropout with truncated Log-Normal noise. These improvements enable data-efficient synthesis of complex neural network policies. We test our approach on a variety of benchmark tasks, demonstrating data-efficiency that is competitive with that of PILeO, while being able to optimize complex neural network controllers. Finally, we assess the performance of the algorithm for learning motor controllers for a six legged autonomous underwater vehicle. This demonstrates the potential of the algorithm for scaling up the dimensionality and dataset sizes, in more complex tasks.",

        "abstract": "Temporal object detection has attracted significant attention, but most popular methods can not leverage the rich temporal information in video or robotic vision. Although many different algorithms have been developed for video detection task, real-time online approaches are frequently deficient. In this paper, based on attention mechanism and convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM), we propose a temporal single-shot detector (TSSD)for robotic vision. Distinct from previous methods, we aim to temporally integrate pyramidal feature hierarchy using ConvLSTM, and design a novel structure including a high-level ConvLSTM unit as well as a low-level one (HL-LSTM)for multi-scale feature maps. Moreover, we develop a creative temporal analysis unit, namely, ConvLSTM-based attention and attention-based ConvLSTM (A&CL), in which the ConvLSTM-based attention is specially tailored for background suppression and scale suppression while the attention-based ConvLSTM temporally integrates attention-aware features. Finally, our method is evaluated on ImageNet VID dataset. Extensive comparisons on detection performance confirm the superiority of the proposed approach, and the developed TSSD achieves a considerably enhanced accuracy vs. speed trade-off, i.e., 64.8% mAP vs. 27 FPS.",

Two versions are considered: a static Tac Whisker array analogous to immotile tactile vibrissae (e.g. rodent microvib-rissae) and a dynamic Tac Whisker array analogous to motile tactile vibrissae (e.g. rodent macrovibrissae). Performance is assessed on an active object localization task. The whisking motion of the dynamic Tac Whisker leads to millimetre-scale location perception, whereas perception with the static Tac Whisker array is relatively poor when making dabbing contacts. The dynamic sensor output is dominated by a self-generated motion signal, which can be compensated by comparing to a reference signal. Overall, the Tac Whisker arrays give a new class of tactile whiskered robots that benefit from being relatively inexpensive and customizable. Furthermore, the biomimetic basis for the Tac Whiskers fits well with building an embodied model of the rodent sensory system for investigating animal perception.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel regrasp control policy that makes use of tactile sensing to plan local grasp adjustments. Our approach determines regrasp actions by virtually searching for local transformations of tactile measurements that improve the quality of the grasp. First, we construct a tactile-based grasp quality metric using a deep convolutional neural network trained on over 2800 grasps. The quality of each grasp, a continuous value between 0 and 1, is determined experimentally by measuring its resistance to external perturbations. Second, we simulate the tactile imprints associated with robot motions relative to the initial grasp by performing rigid-body transformations of the given tactile measurements. The newly generated tactile imprints are evaluated with the learned grasp quality network and the regrasp action is chosen to maximize the grasp quality. Results show that the grasp quality network can predict the outcome of grasps with an average accuracy of 85% on known objects and 75% on novel objects. The regrasp control policy improves the success rate of grasp actions by an average relative increase of 70% on a test set of 8 objects. We provide a video summarizing our approach at https://youtu.be/gjn7DmfpwDk.",

        "abstract": "Fast and accurate visual search is an enabler for many applications of drones. Prior works use POMDPs to produce effective search strategies. As the observation models are from heuristics, the robustness of these approaches on the field is unclear. This work builds a testbed that combines latest developments in related areas, including mobile CNNs for inference on mobile platforms and policy search with point based methods, in a POMDP framework. A dataset for a simple but realistic application, search for a single basketball, is collected to train the perception modules, investigate their error characteristics and validate the control algorithm. From simulation using realistic parameters, we found the significant role persistent factors in the environment can play in designing a fast search strategy. Failure to taking these factors into account results in up to 60% longer search time at the same success rate. Our empirical tests using mobile CNN and real data reveals that prior assumptions on error rates as functions of heights are wrong. The errors grows non-linearly, and there is significant between false positive and false negative rates. Our findings shed new lights on what to consider in designing visual search strategies in a drone platform and is one step towards a fast and robust algorithm.",

        "abstract": "A novel brachiating robot design is presented for the purpose of traversing elevated wire networks. The robot is capable of moving along a single wire and between parallel wires, thereby enabling traversal of a two-dimensional space. Several novel features distinguish this design compared to previous brachiating robots. These include the ability to transition to and from both \u201crope\u201d and \u201cladder\u201d brachiation modes through an integrated wrist, a locking hand design for minimal power consumption, and distributed electronics packages that communicate wirelessly. A payload mounting point is installed, offering space for a variety of remote sensing packages. Experimental results using a prototype robot demonstrate that the system can reliably brachiate along a single wire, and can also reliably perform a swing-up maneuver after failed swing attempts or when transitioning between the rope and ladder locomotion modes. Energy expenditure for a single swing is quantified using experimental data. Overall, the proposed robot design is shown to provide a promising platform for traversal of wire networks in two dimensions.",

In this paper, we instrument a robot with such a prediction ability by leveraging recent deep learning and computer vision techniques. First, our system takes images from the robot camera as input to produce the corresponding human skeleton based on real-time human pose estimation obtained with the OpenPose library. Then, conditioning on this historical sequence, the robot forecasts plausible motion through a motion predictor, generating a corresponding demonstration. Because of a lack of high-level fidelity validation, existing forecasting algorithms suffer from error accumulation and inaccurate prediction. Inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs), we introduce a global discriminator that examines whether the predicted sequence is smooth and realistic. Our resulting motion GAN model achieves superior prediction performance to state-of-the-art approaches when evaluated on the standard H3.6M dataset. Based on this motion GAN model, the robot demonstrates its ability to replay the predicted motion in a human-like manner when interacting with a person.",

Our approach implements robot imitation learning from a human supervisor in virtual reality. A deep 3D convolutional neural network computes grasps from a 3D occupancy grid obtained from depth imaging at multiple viewpoints. In virtual reality, a human supervisor can easily and intuitively demonstrate examples of how to grasp an object, such as a fish. From a few dozen of these demonstrations, we use domain randomization to generate a large synthetic training data set consisting of 100 000 example grasps of fish. Using this data set for training purposes, the network is able to guide a real robot and gripper to grasp real fish with good success rates. The newly proposed domain randomization approach constitutes the first step in how to efficiently perform robot imitation learning from a human supervisor in virtual reality in a way that transfers well to the real world.",

To address this problem, we present a robust spatiotemporal hopping blur filter that protects privacy through de-identification of face regions. The proposed filter is meant for on-board installation and produces temporally smooth and pleasant videos. We apply hopping blur to protect each frame against identification attacks, and minimise artefacts and flicker introduced by the hopping blur. We evaluate the proposed filter against different identification attacks and by assessing the quality of the resulting videos using a subjective test and objective measures.",

Autonomously acquiring such skills, let alone generalizing them to new tasks, is still a major challenge. Typically, manipulation learning is approached with the help of large computation power, very long learning times, or possibly both. However, the performance achieved up to now is still far from human performance. We show the results of our new paradigm to robot manipulation. It bridges and unifies basic motor control, simple and complex manipulation strategies and high-level manipulation planning.

Modularity, adaptability, robustness, intuitive control, limited weight are some of the key elements that could allow to effectively spread these devices in industrial and service applications. Following such guidelines, we present the prototype of the Co-Gripper: a robotic device for cooperative manipulation tasks with humans. The gripper is composed of two pairs of fingers, actuated with two motors, that can be controlled in a coordinated way or independently. Each finger has a modular underactuated structure, composed of three phalanges connected by passive joints. The gripper is wireless, so it can be easily connected both to the robotic arms and on passive structures. We designed a wearable wireless control interface composed of a ring and a bracelet allowing a simple and intuitive activation of the gripper without limiting human operator's manipulation capabilities. We performed a set of tests to quantify gripper performance and to exploit its potentialities in human-robot cooperation tasks.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The paper presents the development of a novel deformable quad-rotor enabled aerial gripper. The mechanism of our deformable quad-rotor is based on simultaneous expansion or contraction of the quad-rotor body, which is generated by controlling a rigid elements based morphing structure (REMS). Such deformation results in a highly deformable quad-rotor that can not only perform morphological adaptation in response to environmental changes and obstacles, but also improve the flight performance by contracting to facilitate the agility/maneuverability or by expanding to enhance the stability. Meanwhile, inspired by the wasp grasping behavior, such controllable expansion and contraction from the REMS ingeniously enable a new function of aerial gripper. In this paper, we start to detail the mechanism and design of the REMS based deformable quad-rotor, then present the quad-rotor deformation enabled aerial gripper design, its dynamics modeling, the grasping function and analysis. The simulation was conducted in order to graphically show the elicited aerodynamic flow situation during expansion or contraction of the quad-rotor with and without carrying payload. Experiments were further implemented to validate the grasping function of the gripper and the flight performance of the quad-rotor. Finally, two case studies on the new aerial gripper were performed. All results demonstrate the excellent performance of the deformable quad-rotor enabled aerial gripper, that is, it has the advantages of both flight maneuverability and grasping capability during performing tasks.",

State-of-the-art systems employ a combination of sensing modalities such as RGB cameras and LiDARs for localizing traffic participants, but monocular localization demonstrations have been confined to plain roads. We demonstrate - to the best of our knowledge - the first results for monocular object localization and shape estimation on surfaces that are non-coplanar with the moving ego vehicle mounted with a monocular camera. We approximate road surfaces by local planar patches and use semantic cues from vehicles in the scene to initialize a local bundle-adjustment like procedure that simultaneously estimates the 3D pose and shape of the vehicles, and the orientation of the local ground plane on which the vehicle stands. We also demonstrate that our approach transfers from synthetic to real data, without any hyperparameter-/fine-tuning. We evaluate the proposed approach on the KITTI and SYNTHIA-SF benchmarks, for a variety of road plane configurations. The proposed approach significantly improves the state-of-the-art for monocular object localization on arbitrarily-shaped roads.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Swing Leg Retraction (SLR) is observed in human walking and running. Previous studies have concluded that SLR improves the stability and robustness of biped walking. But this conclusion was based on analysis of robot models that can only walk at a very small range of step-lengths and slow or fixed speeds. By contrast, humans can walk with a large range of speeds and step-lengths. Moreover, human walking patterns have a special feature that has not been considered in the previous studies on SLR effects: At a given walking speed, v, humans prefer a step-length, s, which satisfies the power law, s-v\u03b2. Therefore, previous studies on SLR can't tell us whether their conclusion will still hold in the full range of human walking patterns (i.e., various walking speeds and step-lengths). This is the question we want to answer in this paper. In this study, using a simple biped model, we studied how the SLR affects the walking stability in the full range of human walking speeds/step-lengths. Preliminary analysis of both models suggests the same conclusion: (1) SLR improves the stability more evidently in human-preferred walking patterns than in other walking patterns. (2) In walking patterns that are very unlike human-preferred ones, the SLR improves the stability very little, or even deteriorates it drastically. Therefore, the new finding of our study is that how the SLR affects the biped walking stability depends on the walking speed and step-length. SLR does not always improve the stability of biped walking.",

Contrary to how they are often portrayed, however, these systems do not necessarily require fundamentally new approaches to engineering or regulatory challenges, i.e., the development of a novel \u201cautonomy framework\u201d applicable to different types of devices. Rather, because autonomous systems generally represent a progressive improvement of existing complex systems, preexisting regulatory scheme offer the best guidance for considering future regulation of autonomous elements. Moreover, the regulatory landscape differs considerably based on the type of device at issue (e.g., consumer electronics vis-\u00e1-vis medical devices). This paper argues that users and regulators must consider future autonomy regulations within the specific framework those devices currently inhabit, rather than focusing on a novel set of rules divorced from the preexisting context.",

The hand mechanics is based on the underactuated TUAT/Karlsruhe mechanism with two motors actuating 10 degrees of freedom. The mechanism has been realized in 3D printing technologies to facilitate a personalization of the prosthetic hand in terms of size and kinematic parameters. The prosthesis has been designed as a 50th percentile male hand. It integrates an advanced embedded system as well as an RGB camera in the base of the palm and a colour display in the back of the hand. Experiments indicate a finger tip force of 7.48 N to 11.82 N, a hook grasp force of 120 N and a hand closing time of ~ 1.3 s.",

We analyze state of the art grippers and robotic hands designed for dexterous in-hand manipulation and extract common characteristics and weak points. The presented concept is obtained from the task requirements for disassembly of electromechanical devices and it is then evaluated for general purpose grasping, in-hand manipulation and operations with tools.

        "abstract": "In times of more and more complex interaction techniques, we point out the powerfulness of colored light as a simple and cheap feedback mechanism. Since it is visible over a distance and does not interfere with other modalities, it is especially interesting for mobile robots. In an online survey, we asked 56 participants to choose the most appropriate colors for scenarios that were presented in the form of videos. In these scenarios a mobile robot accomplished tasks, in some with success, in others it failed because the task is not feasible, in others it stopped because it waited for help. We analyze in what way the color preferences differ between these three categories. The results show a connection between colors and meanings and that it depends on the participants' technical affinity, experience with robots and gender how clear the color preference is for a certain category. Finally, we found out that the participants' favorite color is not related to color preferences.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study the influence of a handshake in the human emotional bond to a robot. In particular, we evaluate the human willingness to help a robot whether the robot first introduces itself to the human with or without a handshake. In the tested paradigm the robot and the human have to perform a joint task, but at a certain stage, the robot needs help to navigate through an obstacle. Without requesting explicit help from the human, the robot performs some attempts to navigate through the obstacle, suggesting to the human that it requires help. In a study with 45 participants, we measure the human's perceptions of the social robot Vizzy, comparing the handshake vs non-handshake conditions. In addition, we evaluate the influence of a handshake in the pro-social behaviour of helping it and the willingness to help it in the future. The results show that a handshake increases the perception of Warmth, Animacy, Likeability, and the tendency to help the robot more, by removing the obstacle.",

        "abstract": "Enter the RobotriX, an extremely photorealistic indoor dataset designed to enable the application of deep learning techniques to a wide variety of robotic vision problems. The RobotriX consists of hyperrealistic indoor scenes which are explored by robot agents which also interact with objects in a visually realistic manner in that simulated world. Photorealistic scenes and robots are rendered by Unreal Engine into a virtual reality headset which captures gaze so that a human operator can move the robot and use controllers for the robotic hands; scene information is dumped on a per-frame basis so that it can be reproduced offline using UnrealCV to generate raw data and ground truth labels. By taking this approach, we were able to generate a dataset of 38 semantic classes across 512 sequences totaling 8M stills recorded at +60 frames per second with full HD resolution. For each frame, RGB-D and 3D information is provided with full annotations in both spaces. Thanks to the high quality and quantity of both raw information and annotations, the RobotriX will serve as a new milestone for investigating 2D and 3D robotic vision tasks with large-scale data-driven techniques.",

        "abstract": "We present a real-time, data-driven algorithm to enhance the social-invisibility of robots within crowds. Our approach is based on prior psychological research, which reveals that people notice and-importantly-react negatively to groups of social actors when they have high entitativity, moving in a tight group with similar appearances and trajectories. In order to evaluate that behavior, we performed a user study to develop navigational algorithms that minimize entitativity. This study establishes mapping between emotional reactions and multi-robot trajectories and appearances, and further generalizes the finding across various environmental conditions. We demonstrate the applicability of our entitativity modeling for trajectory computation for active surveillance and dynamic intervention in simulated robot-human interaction scenarios. Our approach empirically shows that various levels of entitative robots can be used to both avoid and influence pedestrians while not eliciting strong emotional reactions, giving multi-robot systems socially-invisibility.",

        "abstract": "Visual odometry and SLAM methods have a large variety of applications in domains such as augmented reality or robotics. Complementing vision sensors with inertial measurements tremendously improves tracking accuracy and robustness, and thus has spawned large interest in the development of visual-inertial (VI) odometry approaches. In this paper, we propose the TUM VI benchmark, a novel dataset with a diverse set of sequences in different scenes for evaluating VI odometry. It provides camera images with 1024\u00d71024 resolution at 20 Hz, high dynamic range and photometric calibration. An IMU measures accelerations and angular velocities on 3 axes at 200 Hz, while the cameras and IMU sensors are time-synchronized in hardware. For trajectory evaluation, we also provide accurate pose ground truth from a motion capture system at high frequency (120 Hz) at the start and end of the sequences which we accurately aligned with the camera and IMU measurements. The full dataset with raw and calibrated data is publicly available. We also evaluate state-of-the-art VI odometry approaches on our dataset.",

In mining, the extended use of robotics is especially seen in the exploration and exploitation phases, where mineral resources are discovered, extracted and processed. The use of robotics in the mining industry started in the 60s and today it is seen in the automation of material transport or in robotic digging and loading. Potential benefits include improved productivity, decreased production costs, better operational efficiency, increased safety, reduced waste and, ultimately, more value creation. The increasing amount of robotics used in the raw materials sector is coupled with a series of ethical and legal issues, regulatory challenges and policy requirements that affect both producers and end-users of robotic technologies. The benefits and challenges of robotics applications, often overlooked by the stakeholders, can hinder both their integration in the sector and the further development of mining activities, if not properly addressed.",

The algorithm decides if an additional viewpoint is needed and selects the best-fit viewpoint location from a predefined set of locations based on the predicted profitability of such an action. The suggestion of a possible additional viewpoint is based on image analysis for fruit and occlusion level detection, prediction of the expected number of additional targets sensed from that viewpoint, and final decision if choosing the additional viewpoint is beneficial. The developed heuristic was applied on 96 greenhouse images of 30 sweet peppers and resulted in up to 19% improved detection. The harvesting utility cost function decreased by up to 10% compared to the conventional single viewpoint strategy.",

        "abstract": "Aerial filming in action scenes using a drone is difficult for inexperienced flyers because manipulating a remote controller and meeting the desired image composition are two independent, while concurrent, tasks. Existing systems attempt to utilize wearable GPS-based or infrared-based sensors to track the human movement and to assist in capturing footage. However, these sensors work only in either indoor (infrared-based) or outdoor environments (GPS-based), but not both. In this paper, we introduce a novel drone filming system which integrates monocular 3D human pose estimation and localization into a drone platform to remove the constraints imposed by wearable-sensor-based solutions. Meanwhile, given the estimated position, we propose a novel drone control system, called \u201cthrough-the-lens drone filming\u201d, to allow a cameraman to conveniently control the drone by manipulating a 3D model in the preview, which closes the gap between the flight control and the viewpoint design. Our system includes two key enabling techniques: 1) subject localization based on visual-inertial fusion, and 2) through-the-lens camera planning. This is the first drone camera system which allows users to capture human actions by manipulating the camera in a virtual environment. From the drone hardware, we integrate a gimbal camera and two GPUs into the limited space of a drone and demonstrate the feasibility of running the entire system onboard with insignificant delays, which are sufficient for filming in our real-time application. Experimental results, in both simulation and real-world scenarios, demonstrate that our techniques can greatly ease camera control and capture better videos.",

        "abstract": "To properly fuse IMU and camera information for robotics applications, the relative timestamp offset between both sensors' data streams has to be considered. However, finding the exact timestamp offset is often impossible. Thus, it is necessary to additionally consider the offset's uncertainty if we want to produce reliable results. In order to find the offset and its uncertainty, we determine orientation estimates from IMU and camera under interval uncertainty. Subsequently, these intervals are used as a common representation for our bounded-error approach that finds an interval enclosing the true offset while also modeling the uncertainty. Calibration data can be acquired in a few seconds using a simple setup of IMU, camera and camera target. Results using both simulated and real data demonstrate that we are able to determine the offset to an accuracy of 20 ms with a computation time that is suitable for future online applications. Here, our approach could be used to monitor the timestamp offset in a guaranteed way. Additionally, our method can be adapted to determine an interval for the rotation between both sensors. While this increases the computation time drastically, it also enhances the accuracy of the timestamp offset to less than 10 ms.",

The key enabling idea for this is to utilize the tire model (i.e., the magic formula) in a feedback manner on the framework of the constrained Kalman filtering to render the tire force estimation: 1) more accurate as compared to the typical tire force estimation techniques neglecting the tire-road interaction; and 2) more robust as compared to the results adopting the tire model, yet, only in an open-loop manner. Our proposed algorithm, while performing this full tire force onboard/real-time estimation, also provides the estimation of: 1) tire-road friction coefficient; and 2) torque inputs of the rear left and right wheels, which are connected via differential gear. Simulations with CarSim and outdoor experiments are performed to validate the proposed estimation algorithm.",

With this in mind, researchers started the development of biomimetic solutions to control the locomotion of biped models. This work presents a new solution of motion control of bipedal robots with adaptable stiffness, by exploring effects of joint stiffness in modulating walking behavior. Further, torque adjustment is achieved through a biomimetic controller that mimics and adjusts the natural dynamics of the robot to the environment. Specifically, the torque adjustment is made using AFOs (adaptive frequency oscillator) to generate the correct equilibrium positions that will be applied to the impedance control that computes the torque of each joint. Results show that the biped model is capable of walking in several types of terrain, including flat terrain, ramps, stairs and flat terrain with obstacles.",

In this video, we want to show that robots can do it better by moving a bottle or a tankard full of beer that are simply placed on a flat steel plate connected the flange of a robot manipulator. The robot tracks the trajectory defined by a human operator that moves its hand in the 3D space, with a motion capture system that acquires in real time the position. A feed-forward controller, placed between the user and the robot and based on the combination of a smoother and proper orientation compensation, counteracts the lateral accelerations and suppress sloshing phenomena of the liquids. Eventually a camera mounted on the robot arm provides a visual feedback to the operator with monitoring purposes. The challenge for the operator was to drop the carried object. will the feed-forward control be robust enough to avoid this event, even at high speed? Watch the video and find out!",

        "abstract": "Robot-assisted Fenestrated Endovascular Aortic Repair (FEVAR) is currently navigated by 2D fluoroscopy which is insufficiently informative. Previously, a semi-automatic 3D shape instantiation method was developed to instantiate the 3D shape of a main, deployed, and fenestrated stent graft from a single fluoroscopy projection in real-time, which could help 3D FEVAR navigation and robotic path planning. This proposed semi-automatic method was based on the Robust Perspective-S-Point (RP5P) method, graft gap interpolation and semiautomatic multiple-class marker center determination. In this paper, an automatic 3D shape instantiation could be achieved by automatic multiple-class marker segmentation and hence automatic multiple-class marker center determination. Firstly, the markers were designed into five different shapes. Then, Equally-weighted Focal U-Net was proposed to segment the fluoroscopy projections of customized markers into five classes and hence to determine the marker centers. The proposed Equally-weighted Focal U-Net utilized U-Net as the network architecture, equally-weighted loss function for initial marker segmentation, and then equally-weighted focal loss function for improving the initial marker segmentation. This proposed network outperformed traditional Weighted U-Net on the class-imbalance segmentation in this paper with reducing one hyperparameter - the weight. An overall mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.6943 was achieved on 78 testing images, where 81.01 % markers were segmented with a center position error <; 1.6mm. Comparable accuracy of 3D shape instantiation was also achieved and stated. The data, trained models and TensorFlow codes are available on-line.",

To enable a precise pixel-wise fusion of color and depth information good calibration is needed. The calibration determines the intrinsic parameters, the extrinsic parameters, and corrects for depth errors. While classic calibration approaches involve a dedicated calibration target and a trained expert, the autonomous calibration of such camera systems for robots operating in unknown environments is still an open problem. It demands for robust methods that do not need an expert to set up or tune the algorithm. Hence, we present a robust calibration algorithm that utilizes structure from motion (SfM) reconstructions as a calibration target and incorporates plane priors in the optimization to improve the convergence behavior and improve the calibration robustness. We evaluate our method against the state of the art performing over 300 experiments on ten different datasets, and show a significant improvement of the calibration accuracy.",

        "abstract": "System identification of High Altitude Long Endurance fixed-wing aerial vehicles is challenging as its operating flight envelope covers wide ranges of altitudes and Mach numbers. We present a new global system identification framework geared towards such fixed-wing aerial platforms where the aim is to build a global aerodynamic model without many repetitions of local system identification procedures or the use of any aerodynamic database. Instead we apply parameter identification techniques to virtually created system identification data and update the identified parameters with available flight test data. The proposed framework was evaluated using data set outside the flight envelope of the available flight test data, i.e. at different airspeeds considering both interpolation and extrapolation scenarios. The error analysis has shown that the obtained longitudinal aerodynamic model can accurately predict the pitch rate and pitch angle, mostly within a tolerance of \\pm \\pmb{1.5}\\pm \\pmb{1.5} degrees/s and \\pm \\pmb{2}\\pm \\pmb{2} degrees respectively. Such a cost and time efficient model development framework enables high fidelity simulation and precise control which ultimately leads to higher success rates in autonomous missions.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Event cameras are an emerging technology in computer vision, offering extremely low latency and bandwidth, as well as a high temporal resolution and dynamic range. Inherent data compression is achieved as pixel data is only produced by contrast changes at the edges of moving objects. However, current trends in state-of-the-art visual algorithms rely on deep-learning with networks designed to process colour and intensity information contained in dense arrays, but are notoriously computationally heavy. While the combination of these visual technologies could lead to fast, efficient, and accurate detection and recognition algorithms, it is uncertain whether the compressed event-camera data actually contain the required information for these techniques to discriminate between objects and a cluttered background. This paper presents a pilot study in which off-the-shelf deep-learning is applied to visual events for object detection on the iCub robotic platform, and analyses the impact of temporal integration of the event data. We also present a novel pipeline that bootstraps event-based dataset annotation from mature frame-based algorithms, in order to more quickly generate the required datasets.",

        "abstract": "Active learning literature has explored the selection of optimal queries by a learning agent with respect to given criteria, but prior work in classification has focused only on obtaining labels for queried samples. In contrast, proficient learners, like humans, integrate multiple forms of information during learning. This work seeks to enable an active learner to reason about multiple query types concurrently, aimed at soliciting both instance and feature information from the teacher, and to autonomously arbitrate between queries of different types. We contribute the design of rule-based and decision-theoretic arbitration strategies and evaluate all against baselines of more traditional passive and active learning. Our findings show that all arbitration strategies lead to more efficient learning, compared to the baselines. Moreover, given a dynamically changing environment and constrained questioning budget (typical in human settings), the decision-theoretic strategy statistically outperforms all other methods since it reasons about both what query to make and when to make a query, in order to most effectively utilize its questioning budget.",

However, this form of active thermography introduces large signal variations compared to traditional active thermography, which has typically been used to characterize small regions of materials in carefully controlled settings. We demonstrate that a data-driven approach with modern machine learning methods can be used to classify material samples over relatively large surface areas and variable distances. We also introduce the use of z-normalization to improve material classification and reduce variation due to distance and heating intensity. Our best performing algorithm achieved an overall accuracy of 77.7% for multi-class classification among 12 materials placed at varying distances (20 cm, 30 cm, and 40 cm). The observations were made for 5 seconds with 1s of heating and 4s of cooling. We also provide a demonstration of performance with a multi-material scene.",

        "abstract": "As many imitation learning algorithms focus on pure trajectory generation in either Cartesian space or joint space, the problem of considering competing trajectory constraints from both spaces still presents several challenges. In particular, when perturbations are applied to the robot, the underlying controller should take into account the importance of each space for the task execution, and compute the control effort accordingly. However, no such controller formulation exists. In this paper, we provide a minimal intervention control strategy that simultaneously addresses the problems of optimal control and competing constraints between Cartesian and joint spaces. In light of the inconsistency between Cartesian and joint constraints, we exploit the robot null space from an information-theory perspective so as to reduce the corresponding conflict. An optimal solution to the aforementioned controller is derived and furthermore a connection to the classical finite horizon linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is provided. Finally, a writing task in a simulated robot verifies the effectiveness of our approach.",

Robots capable of reasoning about social norms are more likely to be recognized as an extension of our human society. However, norms stated in a form of the human language are inherently vague and abstract. This allows for applying norms in a variety of situations, but if the robots are to adhere to social norms, they must be capable of translating abstract norms to the robotic language. In this paper we use a notion of institution to realize social norms in real robotic systems. We illustrate our approach in a case study, where we translate abstract norms into concrete constraints on cooperative behaviors of humans and robots. We investigate the feasibility of our approach and quantitatively evaluate the performance of our framework in 30 real experiments with user-based evaluation with 40 participants.",

This reconfigurability is commonly restrained by power limitation in autonomous environments, The robotic systems with insufficient torque may lead to inaccurate movements and even transformation failures. This paper presents methodology for optimized reconfiguration planning with torque limitation in modular self-folding robots. We determine reconfiguration schemes with optimal initial pattern and robotic base that result in minimal peak torque by minimizing robotic inertia of the modular architecture. We present minimal bounding box and capacitated spanning tree heuristic algorithms to generate optimal initial patterns and propose 3 heuristic rules for robotic base selection. Our approach is demonstrated in simulation by applying the algorithms to the robotic concept of Mori, a modular origami robot. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms yield reconfiguration schemes with low peak torque, thereby appropriate for real-time applications in modular robotic systems.",

        "abstract": "For successful physical human-robot interaction, the capability of a robot to understand its environment is imperative. More importantly, the robot should extract from the human operator as much information as possible. A reliable 3D skeleton extraction is essential for a robot to predict the intentions of the operator while s/he moves toward the robot or performs a meaningful gesture. For this purpose, we have integrated a time-of-flight depth camera with a state-of-the-art 2D skeleton extraction library namely Openpose, to obtain 3D skeletal joint coordinates reliably. We have also developed a robust and rotation invariant (in the coronal plane)hand gesture detector using a convolutional neural network. At run time (after having been trained)the detector does not require any pre-processing of the hand images. A complete pipeline for skeleton extraction and hand gesture recognition is developed and employed for real-time physical human-robot interaction, demonstrating the promising capability of the designed framework. This work establishes a firm basis and will be extended for the development of intelligent human intention detection in physical human-robot interaction scenarios, to efficiently recognize a variety of static as well as dynamic gestures.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Unsupervised depth estimation from a single image is a very attractive technique with several implications in robotic, autonomous navigation, augmented reality and so on. This topic represents a very challenging task and the advent of deep learning enabled to tackle this problem with excellent results. However, these architectures are extremely deep and complex. Thus, real-time performance can be achieved only by leveraging power-hungry GPUs that do not allow to infer depth maps in application fields characterized by low-power constraints. To tackle this issue, in this paper we propose a novel architecture capable to quickly infer an accurate depth map on a CPU, even of an embedded system, using a pyramid of features extracted from a single input image. Similarly to state-of-the-art, we train our network in an unsupervised manner casting depth estimation as an image reconstruction problem. Extensive experimental results on the KITTI dataset show that compared to the top performing approach our network has similar accuracy but a much lower complexity (about 6% of parameters) enabling to infer a depth map for a KITTI image in about 1.7 s on the Raspberry Pi 3 and at more than 8 Hz on a standard CPU. Moreover, by trading accuracy for efficiency, our network allows to infer maps at about 2 Hz and 40 Hz respectively, still being more accurate than most state-of-the-art slower methods. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first method enabling such performance on CPUs paving the way for effective deployment of unsupervised monocular depth estimation even on embedded systems.",

        "abstract": "We present a visual odometry (VO) algorithm for a multi-camera system and robust operation in challenging environments. Our algorithm consists of a pose tracker and a local mapper. The tracker estimates the current pose by minimizing photometric errors between the most recent keyframe and the current frame. The mapper initializes the depths of all sampled feature points using plane-sweeping stereo. To reduce pose drift, a sliding window optimizer is used to refine poses and structure jointly. Our formulation is flexible enough to support an arbitrary number of stereo cameras. We evaluate our algorithm thoroughly on five datasets. The datasets were captured in different conditions: daytime, night-time with near-infrared (NIR) illumination and nighttime without NIR illumination. Experimental results show that a multi-camera setup makes the VO more robust to challenging environments, especially night-time conditions, in which a single stereo configuration fails easily due to the lack of features.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper strives to answer the following question: Is it possible to recognize an intersection when seen from different road segments that constitute the intersection? An intersection or a junction typically is a meeting point of three or four road segments. Its recognition from a road segment that is transverse to or 180 degrees apart from its previous sighting is an extremely challenging and yet a very relevant problem to be addressed from the point of view of both autonomous driving as well as loop detection. This paper formulates this as a problem of video recognition and proposes a novel LSTM based Siamese style deep network for video recognition. For what is indeed a challenging problem and the limited annotated dataset available we show competitive results of recognizing intersections when approached from diverse viewpoints or road segments. Specifically, we tabulate effective recognition accuracy even as the approaches to the intersection being compared are disparate both in terms of viewpoints and weather/illumination conditions. We show competitive results on both synthetic yet highly realistic data mined from the gaming platform GTA as well as on real world data made available through Mapillary.",

Moreover, for an efficient HRC, the functional role of the object tacker should not only be limited to localizing and tracking objects for robotic manipulation. It should also help to determine the current state of the assembly process and verify if the chosen action has been successfully performed and thus to enable an uninterrupted completion of an HRC assembly process. We present a Context Enhanced Framework for Multi Object Tracking, that i) allows uninterrupted completion of an assembly process, ii) improves the overall functional accuracy of the object tracker from 49 percent to 96 percent, and iii) enables the object tracker to handle multiple instance of multiple objects in a HRC setting.",

        "abstract": "Adapting to the ground enables stable footholds in legged locomotion by exploiting the structure of the terrain. On that account, we present a passive adaptive planar foot with three rotational degrees of freedom that is lightweight and thus suited for highly dynamic legged robots. Its low laying pivot joint provides high stability towards kinking. Information about the relative foot sole pose, and accordingly, the ground orientation is gathered by inertial measurement units (IMUs) placed on the foot sole and the shank. A complementary filter is presented that fuses these orientation estimates with an angular encoder to obtain a drift-free relative foot sole pose. The passive adaptive planar foot has been tested and compared to the classical point foot design on a variety of terrains and shows superior traction performance, especially on compressible soils. Being mounted on the quadrupedal robot ANYmal, the foot provides a reliable contact detection based on the fusion of the built-in 6-axis force/torque transducer and the IMUs. This allows to walk and trot on uneven terrain, loose soils, as well as climbing up a ramp and stairs while keeping the entire foot sole in ground contact all the time.",

        "abstract": "Over the next few years, more and more autonomous mobile robot systems will find their way into modern shop floors. However, it will be necessary to provide human-machine interfaces for interventions in unexpected situations like system-deadlocks, algorithm failures or inabilities. Using virtual or mixed reality-technologies, multi-modal teleoperation offers potential for being a suitable human-machine interface. Essential challenges in this field are, among others, a real-time remote control, a time-efficient and holistic environment detection using multiple sensors, a noise-reduced visualization of sensor-data, and capabilities of object recognition. This paper summarizes research results regarding an architecture capable of a near realtime, interoperable, and operator-supporting teleoperation. The focus of this paper is on a method to efficiently process and visualize point-clouds to meet high frame rate demands of virtual reality applications. To provide near real-time feedback of the robot and its environment over large distances, the presented method is capable to segment known objects from unknown objects to reduce bandwidth requirements. The results of this paper were evaluated using a industrial articulated robotic arm for teleoperation via a long distance UDP/IP communication.",

        "abstract": "Soft material robots are attractive for safe interaction with humans and unstructured environments due to their compliance and low intrinsic stiffness and mass. These properties enable new capabilities such as the ability to conform to environmental geometry for tactile sensing and to undergo large shape changes for actuation. Due to the complex coupling between sensing and actuation in high-dimensional nonlinear soft systems, prior work in soft robotics has primarily focused on either sensing or actuation. This paper presents SOFTcell, a novel controllable stiffness tactile device that incorporates both optical sensing and pneumatic actuation. We report details on the device's design and implementation and analyze results from characterization experiments on sensitivity and performance, which show that SOFTcell can controllably increase its effective modulus from 4.4kPa to 46.1kPa. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of SOFTcell for grasping in a reactive control task in which tactile data is used to detect fingertip shear as a grasped object slips, and cell pressurization is used to prevent the slip without the need to adjust fingertip position.",

        "abstract": "As roles for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)continue to diversify, the ability to sense and interact closely with the environment becomes increasingly important. Within this paper we report on the initial flight tests of a novel adaptively compliant actuator which will allow a UAV to carry out such tasks as the \u201cpick and placement\u201d of remote sensors, structural testing and contact-based inspection. Three key results are discussed and presented; the ability to physically apply forces with the UAV through the use of an active compliant manipulator; the ability to tailor these forces through tuning of the manipulator controller gains; and the ability to apply a rapid series of physical pulses in order to excite remotely placed sensors, e.g. vibration sensors. A series of over sixty flight tests have been used to generate initial results which clearly demonstrate the potential of this new type of compliant aerial actuator.",

        "abstract": "Robotics can play a significant role in the rehabilitation of patients with spasticity by improving their early diagnosis and reducing the costs associated with care. Spasticity is a muscle control disorder characterized by an increase in muscle tone with exaggerated stretch reflexes, as one component of the upper motor neuron syndrome. Furthermore, spasticity is present in other pathologies, such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida, brain stroke among others. This video shows the ongoing research on developing a platform for the modelling and the assessment of spasticity using collaborative robots as clinical tool. Our aim is to develop methods for non-invasive biomechanical modelling of upper limbs joints using 7-DOF Rosen Kinematics [1], mixed with a non-linear state of Hills force-velocity relation [2], improved by introducing new parameters such as rigidity, viscoelasticity, extensibility and thixotropy. After a learning phase performed by the therapist, the robot replicates the trajectories required to perform the assessment. The video also describes the detailed analysis of passive movement response (force/torque and position/velocity)of the limb. These parameters will be used to determine the degree of spasticity of patients in a fast and objective manner, while simultaneously developing new clinical scales, such as a modified version of Ashworth [3].",

        "abstract": "We report on lift experiments conducted at scale for an artificial platform mimicking the dragonfly species: Sympetrum sanguineum. The platform, as well as the lift sensor, was custom designed and built. The flapping mechanism consisted of a piezoelectric bending-beam actuator, transmission using carbon-fiber elements and polymide-film joints, and wings constructed of polyester film with carbon-fiber support structure. The flapping kinematics of the Sympetrum san-guineum was replicated as closely as possible although only a pair of forewings were used in these experiments. The lift generated, when accounting for the addition of a pair of hindwings, is sufficient to allow for the hovering of a real-life dragonfly. The results, the first at-scale fully transient measurements of artificial dragonfly forewings, show that the lift curves quantitatively as well as qualitatively validate existing 2D and 3D computer simulations of dragonfly forewings.",

However, the first and most important step, i.e., getting the percutaneous access to create the tract between the targeted calyx and the flank skin, is challenging as the surgeon is often occupied by several tasks at a given time. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a robotic assisted system that collaborates with the surgeon and provides assistance in order for the surgeons to focus on more critical jobs resulting in better surgical performance. A procedure for this robot including three working stages is described. This procedure allows the surgeon to choose a suitable percutaneous target using an ultrasound probe based on his or her experience and the robot will track the respiratory motion of the target kidney stone and insert the needle automatically after the surgeon releases the probe. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the procedure with the proposed assisted robot for PCNL.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper represents a step towards vision-based manipulation of plastic materials. Manipulating deformable objects is made challenging by: 1) the absence of a model for the object deformation, 2) the inherent difficulty of visual tracking of deformable objects, 3) the difficulty in defining a visual error and 4) the difficulty in generating control inputs to minimise the visual error. We propose a novel representation of the task of manipulating deformable objects. In this preliminary case study, the shaping of kinetic sand, we assume a finite set of actions: pushing, tapping and incising. We consider that these action types affect only a subset of the state, i.e., their effect does not affect the entire state of the system (specialized actions). We report the results of a user study to validate these hypotheses and release the recorded dataset. The actions (pushing, tapping and incising) are clearly adopted during the task, although it is clear that 1) participants use also mixed actions and 2) actions' effects can marginally affect the entire state, requesting a relaxation of our specialized actions hypothesis. Moreover, we compute task errors and corresponding control inputs (in the image space) using image processing. Finally, we show how machine learning can be applied to infer the mapping from error to action on the data extracted from the user study.",

We first employ a time-frequency spatial filter to estimate, on short audio segments, the direction of arrival of the moving source and then we track these noisy estimations with a particle filter. We quantitatively evaluate the results using a ground-truth trajectory of the sound source obtained with an on-board camera and compare the performance of the proposed method with baseline solutions.",

        "abstract": "In order to perform safe robotic interventions in harsh environments it is necessary to help the robotic operator with a Human-Robot Interface that provides multimodal interactions, from low level interaction methods to bilateral teleoperation with force feedback. These interaction modalities, though, rely purely on the operator's skills. With the objective of providing a safer system, higher-level applications can be integrated in the interface in order to provide some help to the operator, without relying uniquely on his/her capacities. This paper presents a novel object recognition and tracking system which runs in real-time on the robot while the operator is operating it. The tracking system enters in the teleoperation loop and helps the operator to achieve the requested goals. The system is optimized to track featureless objects such as metallic plates, metallic connectors and monochromatic objects. Moreover, the algorithm provides improvements with respect to previous tracking experiments, including depth estimation in order to better interact with the velocity control of the robotic arm when approaching the target, as well as high reliability with partial occlusions. This vision-based control system is used in real interventions in hazardous environments, in order to track and manipulate metallic parts of scientific and engineering machines, giving a performance success over 95%, and reaching the 100% under the remote human supervision.",

In many cases, understanding, expectations and behaviors are constrained, if not driven, by culture. Can we provide human culture to an artificial agent? Can we provide formal representations of different cultures? In this paper we discuss the (elusive) notion of culture and propose an approach based on the notion of trait which, we argue, allows building formal modules suitable to represent culture (broadly understood). We distinguish the trait types (knowledge, rule, behavior, interpretation) that such modules should contain and briefly discuss how they could be organized. Finally, we exemplify the role of a trait module in the flow of information internal to an agent highlighting surprising potentialities.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Emerging robot-assisted endovascular intervention has the potential to reduce X-ray radiations to the operator while enhancing the stability and dexterity of catheter manipulation. Supervised and shared autonomy of endovascular procedures could add further improvements in reduced fatigue and cognitive workloads of the operator, higher success rates of cannulation and improved surgical outcomes. However, robotic path planning for endovascular procedure is challenging due to complex and non-linear flow dynamics inside the vasculature. This paper presents a learning-based robotic catheterization platform addressing those challenges, this approach incorporates path integral reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on dynamic movement primitives (DMP) to enhance catheterization tasks by a customized robotic manipulator. The robotic trajectories were optimized through RL in order to avoid unwanted contacts between the catheter tip and the vessel wall. The proposed methods can adapt to different flow simulations, vascular models, and catheterization tasks. The quality of the catheterization was evaluated with performance metrics. The results show significant refinement of catheter paths by the proposed approach, resulting in shorter overall lengths and fewer contact forces, which can potentially reduce risks in endothelial wall damages, embolization, and stroke. The results support the development of robotic path planning for endovascular procedures as well as designing intelligent, hands-on robotic navigation platforms.",

        "abstract": "We describe a trajectory planning method for heterogeneous mobile robot teams in known environments. We consider two core problems that arise with heterogeneous robot teams: asymmetric inter-robot collision constraints and varying dynamic limits. Asymmetric collision constraints are important for close-proximity flight of rotorcraft due to the downwash effect, which complicates spatial coordination. Varying dynamic limits complicate temporal coordination between robots and must be taken into account during planning. Our method builds upon a hybrid planner that combines graph-planning techniques with trajectory optimization and scales well to large homogeneous robot teams. We extend the hybrid planning approach to include the additional spatial and temporal coordination to support heterogeneous teams. Our method scales well with the number of robots and robot types and we demonstrate our approach on a team of 15 physical robots of 4 different types, including quadrotors and differential drive robots.",

        "abstract": "One desirable capability of autonomous cars is to accurately predict the pedestrian motion near intersections for safe and efficient trajectory planning. We are interested in developing transfer learning algorithms that can be trained on the pedestrian trajectories collected at one intersection and yet still provide accurate predictions of the trajectories at another, previously unseen intersection. We first discussed the feature selection for transferable pedestrian motion models in general. Following this discussion, we developed one transferable pedestrian motion prediction algorithm based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) that infers pedestrian intentions and predicts future trajectories based on observed trajectory. We evaluated our algorithm at three intersections. We used the accuracy of augmented semi-nonnegative sparse coding (ASNSC), trained and tested at the same intersection as a baseline. The result shows that the proposed algorithm improves the baseline accuracy by a statistically significant percentage in both non-transfer task and transfer task.",

        "abstract": "Hand-eye coordination is a requirement for many manipulation tasks including grasping and reaching. However, accurate hand-eye coordination has shown to be especially difficult to achieve in complex robots like the iCub humanoid. In this work, we solve the hand-eye coordination task using a visuomotor deep neural network predictor that estimates the arm's joint configuration given a stereo image pair of the arm and the underlying head configuration. As there are various unavoidable sources of sensing error on the physical robot, we train the predictor on images obtained from simulation. The images from simulation were modified to look realistic using an image-to-image translation approach. In various experiments, we first show that the visuomotor predictor provides accurate joint estimates of the iCub's hand in simulation. We then show that the predictor can be used to obtain the systematic error of the robot's joint measurements on the physical iCub robot. We demonstrate that a calibrator can be designed to automatically compensate this error. Finally, we validate that this enables accurate reaching of objects while circumventing manual fine-calibration of the robot.",

In this work, we present, and make publicly available, a novel dataset called BarkNet 1.0 containing more than 23,000 high-resolution bark images from 23 different tree species over a wide range of tree diameters. With it, we demonstrate the feasibility of species recognition through bark images, using deep learning. More specifically, we obtain an accuracy of 93.88% on single crop, and an accuracy of 97.81% using a majority voting approach on all of the images of a tree. We also empirically demonstrate that, for a fixed number of images, it is better to maximize the number of tree individuals in the training database, thus directing future data collection efforts.",

In addition, we propose a novel lightweight filtering-based loop closing technique to reduce accumulated drift without global bundle adjustment or pose graph optimization. We formulate loop closure as EKF updates to optimally relocate the current sliding window maintained by the filter to past keyframes. We also present the Trifo Ironsides dataset, a new visual-inertial dataset, featuring high-quality synchronized stereo camera and IMU data from the Ironsides sensor [3] with various motion types and textures and millimeter-accuracy groundtruth. To validate the performance of the proposed system, we conduct extensive comparison with state-of-the-art approaches (OKVIS, VINS-MONO and S-MSCKF) using both the public EuRoC dataset and the Trifo Ironsides dataset.",

However, because most RCM mechanisms have been developed for laparoscopic surgery or needle insertion into soft tissue, they lack rigidity and are unsuitable for bone drilling. One of the most difficult and important surgical procedures in bone drilling is maintaining as well as guiding the orientation of the drill with respect to the target. This paper proposes an improved RCM mechanism in which a pair of linear actuators and a gearless arc-guide are employed to achieve high rigidity and resolution, which enable bone drilling. A vision-guided navigation system is also integrated into the proposed system to automatically guide the orientation. To verify that the proposed RCM mechanism has sufficient rigidity and targeting accuracy, a series of experiments was performed. The results obtained confirm that the proposed mechanism can maintain its tilting angle under up to 50 N, with a targeting error of approximately 0.28mm.",

        "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can charge Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) in remote or hard to access locations. However, the charging efficiency is heavily affected by the distance between the wireless transmitter and receiver. This efficiency impacts the possible power level increase of each charged node. Most charging algorithms require full knowledge of sensor nodes' power levels to identify the nodes to charge. Collecting this power information adds overhead to the network and limits scalability. We propose and implement Charging with Power Transfer Efficiency Compensation (CPTEC), an algorithm that charges a WRSN without the need for a priori knowledge of the nodes' power levels. We show that CPTEC compensates for efficiency drops, due to landing alignments, making it practical for real-world power transfer scenarios. Our results show that CPTEC is able to perform with a median at \u2248 72% of the optimal performance of a full knowledge algorithm that assumes maximum power transfer efficiency, while other work drops to \u2248 22%. Under constant maximum efficiency CPTEC performs \u2248 90% of the optimal full knowledge case.",

The goal of the defenders (UAV/UGV team) is to stop all attackers as quickly as possible, before they arrive at their selected goal. The uncertainty considered is twofold: the defenders do not know the attackers' location and destination, and there is also uncertainty in the defenders' sensing. We suggest a real-time algorithmic framework for the defenders, combining entropy and stochastic-temporal belief, that aims at optimizing the probability of a quick and successful capture of all of the attackers. We have empirically evaluated the algorithmic framework, and have shown its efficiency and significant performance improvement compared to other solutions.",

UNDERWORLDS allows programmers to represent the robot's environment as real-time distributed data structures, containing both scene graphs (for representation of 3D geometries) and timelines (for representation of temporal events). UNDERWORLDS supports cascading representations: the environment is viewed as a set of worlds that can each have different spatial and temporal granularities, and may inherit from each other. UNDERWORLDS also provides a set of high-level client libraries and tools to introspect and manipulate the environment models.

Experimental results show that the cleaning efficiency for three different sizes of glass beads, 53-75 \u03bcm, 75-90 \u03bcm, and 90-106 \u03bcm, ranges between 75-99% when using a combination of electrostatic and ultrasonic cleaning. This is a far higher efficiency than when using electrostatic repulsion alone. Experiments also demonstrate an approximately 33% recovery in shear stress on a flat glass for a contaminated directional gecko-like adhesive after contact with a dusty table when electrostatic/ultrasonic cleaning was used. Finally, by applying this method on a robotic gripper, we observed an 18% recovery in normal adhesion on a flat glass substrate.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a deep network based unsupervised visual odometry system for 6-DoF camera pose estimation and finding dense depth map for its monocular view. The proposed network is trained using unlabeled binocular stereo image pairs and is shown to provide superior performance in depth and ego-motion estimation compared to the existing state-of-the-art. This is achieved by introducing a novel objective function and training the network using temporally alligned sequences of monocular images. The objective function is based on the Charbonnier penalty applied to spatial and bi-directional temporal reconstruction losses. The overall novelty of the approach lies in the fact that the proposed deep framework combines a disparity-based depth estimation network with a pose estimation network to obtain absolute scale-aware 6-DoF camera pose and superior depth map. According to our knowledge, such a framework with complete unsupervised end-to-end learning has not been tried so far, making it a novel contribution in the field. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through performance comparison with the state-of-the-art methods on KITTI driving dataset.",

        "abstract": "Leader-Follower is a hierarchical form of multi-robot formation control, where each robot aims to maintain specific predefined angle and distance from one or more robots in the team (referred to as its local leaders), while a single robot is selected to lead the entire formation to a desired destination. When the robots are given a specific formation to maintain, their goal is usually to minimize the deviation from this desired formation (maximizing the accuracy) during their journey. Previous work has considered optimality in an uncertain environment only in centralized setting (or using perfect, or almost perfect communication). In this paper we examine the problem of optimal multi-robot formation control in a distributed setting, while accounting for two challenges: sensory uncertainty and absence of communication. Specifically, we present an algorithm that allows each individual robot to estimate the overall formation accuracy of the other robots in their field of view via a tree reconstruction algorithm. The algorithm is used to select the most accurate local leader, or to generate virtual local leader via a weighted average of all visible robots. We provide both theoretical analysis and an extensive empirical evaluation (in ROS/Gazebo simulated environment) showing the effectiveness of the two approaches.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In real-world robotics, motion planning remains to be an open challenge. Not only robotic systems are required to move through unexplored environments, but also their manoeuvrability is constrained by their dynamics and often suffer from uncertainty. One approach to overcome this problem is to incrementally map the surroundings while, simultaneously, planning a safe and feasible path to a desired goal. This is especially critical in underwater environments, where autonomous vehicles must deal with both motion and environment uncertainties. In order to cope with these constraints, this work proposes an uncertainty-based framework for mapping and planning3 feasible motions online with probabilistic safety-guarantees. The proposed approach deals with the motion, probabilistic safety, and online computation constraints by (i) incrementally representing the environment as a collection of local maps, and (ii) iteratively (re)planning kinodynamically-feasible and probabilistically-safe paths to goal. The proposed framework is evaluated on the Sparus II, a nonholonomic torpedo-shaped AUV, by conducting simulated and real-world trials, thus proving the efficacy of the method and its suitability even for systems with limited on-board computational power.",

We first improve the dynamic model of caudal fins based on the Morison equation. Combined with experimental data, we optimize the model parameters and then obtain the optimal control strategy of uniform swing. In addition, we apply the CPGs control strategy and improve it based on the FroBot model. These two control strategies have their advantages and demonstrate the potential for future use in control applications.",

There are thousands of shafts of this type in Europe with the danger of pollution, flood and collapse. This paper presents some of the main ongoing works of the EU project STAMS that develop an autonomous underwater robotic system for periodic monitoring of flooded shafts in hazardous and complex conditions. The accurate navigation is very cluttered at 1.000 m depth conditions, where minimum visibility and unexpected obstacles are some of the difficulties to overcome. We are going beyond classical navigation approaches using only few sensor information. Another innovation is the installation of Reference Points (RPs) in the shaft's walls by the robot using a special fixation mechanism. The specially designed cases of the RPs allow to house specific sensors and help in the navigation, and will be used in periodic monitoring and assessment of the mine shafts. The positioning and attachment of these RPs is another contribution of this paper.",

Contrary to the Cartesian 3D representation, the unit quaternion can well represent features at both large and small distances from the camera without suffering from convergence problems. Contrary to inverse-depth, homogeneous points, or anchored homogeneous points, the unit quaternion has error state of minimum dimension of three. In contrast to prior representations, the proposed method does not need to approximate an initial infinite depth uncertainty. In fact, the unit-quaternion error covariance can be initialized from the initial feature observations without prior information, and the initial error-states are not only bounded, but the bound is identical for all scene geometries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time bearing-only recursive estimation (in covariance form) of point features has been possible without using measurements to initialize error covariance. The proposed unit quaternion-based representation is validated on numerical examples.",

The STS transitions assistance is achieved through a power transfer mechanism that synchronizes knees and lumbar motion through a cable-driven pulley system. We analyze the human body dynamics in the posture transition with a rigid link model and the interaction interface with the exoskeleton through an impedance model for producing a passive system voluntarily controlled by natural motions of the upper body. Therefore, allowing the potential users to achieve STS transitions with their body residual capabilities without an external power source. Instead, transferring power from their upper-body to lower-body, herewith, controlling a passive energy storage. A prototype was constructed and evaluated with seven healthy subjects observing the proposed motion and muscle activity during the STS transitions. The results show a significant reduction in the muscle activity evaluated, at the erector spinae, gluteus maximus and rectus femoris, with reductions between 30% to 50% at the p <; 0.01 level comparing STS transitions with and without the exoskeleton support. Concluding that the STS transitions support is feasible with the passive exoskeleton envisioned for applications in upright locomotion, STS training, and rehabilitation.",

However, combining a robust estimation with computational efficiency remains challenging, specifically for low-cost aerial vehicles in which the quality of the sensors and the processor power are constrained by size, weight and cost. In this paper, we present an innovative filter for stereo visual inertial odometry building on: (i) the recently introduced stereo multistate constraint Kalman filter; (ii) the invariant filtering theory; and (iii) the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) on Lie groups. Our solution combines accuracy, robustness and versatility of the UKF.

        "abstract": "Object proposal that detects candidate bounding boxes of objects in images is an effective way of accelerating object recognition in the robot/computer vision area. We propose an accurate and fast object proposal method using depth images. Existing proposal methods can be roughly divided into two categories: window scoring and object region extraction. The window scoring methods usually have higher efficiency than object region extraction methods. The previous methods using RGB images detect an excessive number of boxes due to edges of texture objects. These methods also may misdetect overlapping objects as one candidate bounding box. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel and effective objectness measure using depth images. The proposed method evaluates objectness by using depth boundary density difference between inner and outer regions of a candidate bounding box. We also consider the uniformity of the outer boundary density in a candidate bounding box to divide overlapping objects into individual candidate bounding boxes. Our reasonable assumption here is that the depth boundary of an object has a closed loop. Our experiments show significant performance gains over existing RGB and RGB-D object proposal methods on the challenging toy-dataset [1] of complex crowded scenes.",

We establish the supervision by warping view sequences and assigning the re-projection minimization to the loss function, which we adopt in multi-view pose estimation and single-view depth estimation network.

Unsupervised deep learning network, stacking convolutional auto-encoder, is employed to extract more discriminative features from videos in an effective way. To further improve the accuracy of segmentation, on one hand, wavelet transform is used to filter out the noises existed in the features from video and kinematic data. On the other hand, the segmentation result is promoted by identifying the adjacent segments with no state transition based on the predefined similarity measurements. Extensive experiments on a public dataset JIGSAWS show that our method achieves much higher accuracy of segmentation than state-of-the-art methods in the shorter time.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Robotic telemanipulators are already widely used in nuclear decommissioning sites for handling radioactive waste. However, currently employed systems are still extremely primitive, making the handling of these materials prohibitively slow and ineffective. As the estimated cost for the decommissioning and clean-up of nuclear sites keeps rising, it is clear that one would need faster and more effective approaches. Towards this goal, in this paper we present the user evaluation of a recently proposed haptic-enabled shared-control architecture for telemanipulation. An autonomous algorithm regulates a subset of the slave manipulator degrees of freedom (DoF) in order to help the human operator in grasping an object of interest. The human operator can then steer the manipulator along the remaining null-space directions with respect to the main task by acting on a grounded haptic interface. The haptic cues provided to the operator are designed in order to inform about the feasibility of the user's commands with respect to possible constraints of the robotic system. In this paper we compared this shared-control architecture against a classical 6-DOF teleoperation approach in a real scenario by running experiments with 10 subjects. The results clearly show that the proposed shared-control approach is a viable and effective solution for improving currently-available teleoperation systems in remote telemanipulation tasks.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we describe a control strategy for a user-adaptive human-robot system for an intelligent robotic Mobility Assistive Device (MAD)using raw data from a single laser-range-finder (LRF)mounted on the MAD and scanning the walking area. The proposed control architecture consists of three modules. In the first module, a previously proposed methodology (termed IMM-PDA-PF)delivers the augmented human state estimation of the user by providing robust leg tracking and on-line estimation of the human gait phases. This information is processed at the next module for providing the pathological gait parametrization and characterization, by computing specific gait parameters for each gait cycle. These gait parameters form the feature vector that classifies the user in a certain class related to risk of fall. Those are of particular significance to the system, since the gait parameters and the respective class are used in the third module, i.e. the human-robot formation controller, in order to adapt the desired formation of the human-robot system, by selecting the appropriate control variables. The experimental evaluation comprises gait data from real patients, and demonstrates the stability of the human-robot formation control, indicating the importance of incorporating an on-line gait characterization of the user, using non-wearable and non-invasive methods, in the context of a robotic MAD.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In collaborative human-robot navigation such as when driving semi-autonomous robotic wheelchairs, intuitive control of the mobile robot is only possible if the robot understands its user. This becomes especially important as users present varying levels of abilities and heterogeneous driving styles. Furthermore, the robot needs to consider the inherent uncertainty on its navigation task because the user may not be able to communicate his or her plans explicitly. In order to address these requirements, we have adopted a probabilistic framework to recognise navigation plans. A key component in this framework is a personalised driver model, which captures how a particular user transforms his or her mental navigation plan into inputs to the robot. In this work, we evaluate the use of Gaussian Processes to implement and calibrate this probabilistic, user-specific driver model, and this for use with haptic joysticks. Furthermore, special care was taken to obtain fast online evaluation of this user model through sparse approximation and parallel computation on a GPU. This resulted in an achievable user model evaluation frequency of 40 Hz, which is far above the navigation assistance frequency we aimed for, i.e. 5 Hz. We illustrate the validity of the approach by recognising the navigation plans of a spastic wheelchair user.",

Specifically, we use this approach to analyze three different types of hands (one underactuated, one fully actuated, one fully actuated with compliant distal joints) as they are used to perform two manipulation tasks. The first task uses a power grasp (spraying with a spray bottle), the second a precision grasp (tracing a line on a bowl with a pen). We show that compliance in the distal joints significantly improves performance and task completion. We also show that humans choose significantly different poses for the same task when using a fully-actuated versus underactuated hand, which also results in superior task performance. Our results suggest that humans use a combination of under-actuated and fully-actuated techniques, which when used on robotic systems would also improve their performance on manipulation tasks.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a re-descriptive approach to the efficient acquisition of ever higher level and more precise utility models within the motivational system (MotivEn) of a cognitive architecture. The approach is based on a two-step process whereby, as a first step, simple imprecise sensor correlation related utility models are obtained from the interaction traces of the robot. These utility models allow the robot to increase the frequency of achieving goals, and thus, provide lots of traces that can be used to try to train precise value functions implemented as artificial neural networks. The approach is tested experimentally on a real robotic setup that involves the coordination of two robots.",

The 4 fingered VARO-fi consists of 9 degrees of freedom and it can perform several in-hand manipulation tasks which have been described in this paper. Moreover, the gripper is a simplification of previously proposed gripper platform called Dexclar. The derivation of VARO-fi has been presented and its capabilities have been demonstrated by experiments. Although a generic convex payload is considered as a primitive in the design of VARO-fi however, it is capable to address manipulation for other regular shaped payloads, which has been proven by experiments. A comparison is also illustrated in order to underline the strength of the novel gripper with respect to the state of the art.",

Semantic edge features denote edge contours that separate pairs of distinct objects such as building-sky, road-sidewalk, and building-ground. While prior work has shown promising results by utilizing the boundary between prominent classes such as sky and building using skylines, we generalize this to consider 19 semantic classes. We extract semantic edge features using CASENet architecture and utilize VLAD framework to perform image retrieval. We achieve improvement over state-of-the-art localization algorithms such as SIFT-VLAD and its deep variant NetVLAD. Ablation study shows the importance of different semantic classes, and our unified approach achieves better performance compared to individual prominent features such as skylines. We also introduce SLC Marathon dataset, a challenging dataset covering most of Salt Lake City with sufficient lighting variations.",

        "abstract": "Unsupervised video prediction is a very challenging task due to the complexity and diversity in natural scenes. Prior works directly predicting pixels or optical flows either have the blurring problem or require additional assumptions. We highlight that the crux for video frame prediction lies in precisely capturing the inter-frame variations which encompass the movement of objects and the evolution of the surrounding environment. We then present an unsupervised video prediction framework - Variation Network (VarNet) to directly predict the variations between adjacent frames which are then fused with current frame to generate the future frame. In addition, we propose an adaptively re-weighting mechanism for loss function to offer each pixel a fair weight according to the amplitude of its variation. Extensive experiments for both short-term and long-term video prediction are implemented on two advanced datasets - KTH and KITTI with two evaluating metrics - PSNR and SSIM. For the KTH dataset, the VarNet outperforms the state-of-the-art works up to 11.9% on PSNR and 9.5% on SSIM. As for the KITTI dataset, the performance boosts are up to 55.1% on PSNR and 15.9% on SSIM. Moreover, we verify that the generalization ability of our model excels other state-of-the-art methods by testing on the unseen CalTech Pedestrian dataset after being trained on the KITTI dataset.

DNN training has been shown to result in high accuracy for perception to action learning given sufficient training data. However, the trained models may fail without warning in situations with insufficient or biased training data. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel architecture for self-supervised learning of latent variables to detect the insufficiently trained situations. Our method also addresses training data imbalance, by learning a set of underlying latent variables that characterize the training data and evaluate potential biases. We show how these latent distributions can be leveraged to adapt and accelerate the training pipeline by training on only a fraction of the total dataset. We evaluate our approach on a challenging dataset for driving. The data is collected from a full-scale autonomous vehicle. Our method provides qualitative explanation for the latent variables learned in the model. Finally, we show how our model can be additionally trained as an end-to-end controller, directly outputting a steering control command for an autonomous vehicle.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Recent developments in Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) systems have demonstrated the potential of road vehicles as an efficient mode of urban transportation Newly developed algorithms can compute vehicle routes in real-time for batches of requests and allow for multiple requests to share vehicles. These algorithms have primarily focused on optimally producing vehicle schedules to pick up and drop off requests. The redistribution of idle vehicles to areas of high demand, known as rebalancing, on the contrary has received little attention in the context of ride-sharing. In this paper, we present a method to rebalance idle vehicles in a ride-sharing enabled MoD fleet. This method consists of an algorithm to optimally partition the fleet operating area into rebalancing regions, an algorithm to determine a real-time demand estimate for every region using incoming requests, and an algorithm to optimize the assignment of idle vehicles to these rebalancing regions using an integer linear program. Evaluation with historical taxi data from Manhattan shows that we can service 99.8% of taxi requests in Manhattan using 3000 vehicles with an average waiting time of 57.4 seconds and an average in-car delay of 13.7 seconds. Moreover, we can achieve a higher service rate using 2000 vehicles than prior work achieved with 3000. Furthermore, with a fleet of 3000 vehicles, we reduce the average travel delay by 86%, the average waiting time by 37%, and the amount of ignored requests by 95% compared to earlier work at the expense of an increased distance travelled by the fleet.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Walking ability is critically important for pediatric health, well-being, and independence. Children with cerebral palsy (CP), the most prevalent cause of pediatric physical disability, often present pathological gait patterns that negatively impact walking capacity. Reduced function of the muscles surrounding the ankle joint in those with CP also greatly increases the energy cost of transport leading to reduce mobility. Ankle-foot-orthoses show limited effectiveness for clinically relevant improvement in gait mechanics, while orthopedic surgery, muscle injections and physical therapy are unable to completely restore gait function. While wearable exoskeletons hold promise for gait rehabilitation, appropriately controlling the timing and magnitude of powered assistance across individuals and conditions remains a considerable challenge. This work seeks to address this challenge through the design and initial clinical verification of a simple ankle exoskeleton control scheme designed to reduce the metabolic cost of transport during walking in an individual with CP. Preliminary experimental results from instrumented gait analysis following 5 training visits demonstrated a 45% increase in positive ankle power and a 16% reduction in net metabolic rate during walking with the exoskeleton providing powered plantar-flexion assistance compared to walking without the exoskeleton. Future work will expand this investigation to a larger cohort of individuals with CP and across additional modes of locomotion.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "During percutaneous interventions in the brain, puncturing a vessel can cause life threatening complications. To avoid such a risk, current research has been directed towards the development of steerable needles. However, there is a risk that vessels of a size which is close to or smaller than the resolution of commonly used preoperative imaging modalities (0.59 \u00d7 0.59 \u00d7 1 mm) would not be detected during procedure planning, with a consequent increase in risk to the patient. In this work, we present a novel ensemble of forward looking sensors based on laser Doppler flowmetry, which are embedded within a biologically inspired steerable needle to enable vessel detection during the insertion process. Four Doppler signals are used to classify the pose of a vessel in front of the advancing needle with a high degree of accuracy (2\u00b0 and 0.1 mm RMS errors), where relative measurements between sensors are used to correct for ambiguity. By using a robotic assisted needle insertion process, and thus a precisely controlled insertion speed, we also demonstrate how the setup can be used to discriminate between tissue bulk motion and vessel motion. In doing so, we describe a sensing apparatus applicable to a variety of needle steering systems, with the potential to eliminate the risk of hemorrhage during percutaneous procedures.",

The spatiotemporal filter uses the human skeleton and mixes temporal smoothing in two-time inverse kinematics computations.

This is especially of relevance for non-expert users living in human-robot shared spaces, e.g. home environments, since they want to keep the control of their mobile robots, such as vacuum cleaning or companion robots. Therefore, we introduce virtual borders that are respected by a robot while performing its tasks. For this purpose, we employ a RGB-D Google Tango tablet as human-robot interface in combination with an augmented reality application to flexibly define virtual borders. We evaluated our system with 15 non-expert users concerning accuracy, teaching time and correctness and compared the results with other baseline methods based on visual markers and a laser pointer. The experimental results show that our method features an equally high accuracy while reducing the teaching time significantly compared to the baseline methods. This holds for different border lengths, shapes and variations in the teaching process. Finally, we demonstrated the correctness of the approach, i.e. the mobile robot changes its navigational behavior according to the user-defined virtual borders.",

        "abstract": "Robots hold promise in many scenarios involving outdoor use, such as search-and-rescue, wildlife management, and collecting data to improve environment, climate, and weather forecasting. However, autonomous navigation of outdoor trails remains a challenging problem. Recent work has sought to address this issue using deep learning. Although this approach has achieved state-of-the-art results, the deep learning paradigm may be limited due to a reliance on large amounts of annotated training data. Collecting and curating training datasets may not be feasible or practical in many situations, especially as trail conditions may change due to seasonal weather variations, storms, and natural erosion. In this paper, we explore an approach to address this issue through virtual-to-real-world transfer learning using a variety of deep learning models trained to classify the direction of a trail in an image. Our approach utilizes synthetic data gathered from virtual environments for model training, bypassing the need to collect a large amount of real images of the outdoors. We validate our approach in three main ways. First, we demonstrate that our models achieve classification accuracies upwards of 95% on our synthetic data set. Next, we utilize our classification models in the control system of a simulated robot to demonstrate feasibility. Finally, we evaluate our models on real-world trail data and demonstrate the potential of virtual-to-real-world transfer learning.",

This is a coupled problem that involves computation of a guard set for the environment and route planning for a heterogeneous group of robots through the points in the guard set. A terrain path that needs to be monitored can be transformed to generate a 1.5D terrain and robot paths can be modeled as chain visible curves to the terrain to ensure visibility. To efficiently monitor this 1.5D terrain, we present two solutions - a dynamic programming approach that finds the optimal solution but is slower and a integer linear programming solution that is faster in practice and that can take more constraints into account. We perform extensive simulations and do a comparative analysis of the two solution techniques.",

        "abstract": "Deployment of aerial robotic vehicles for real world tasks such as home deliveries, close range aerial inspection, etc., require robotic vehicles to fly through complex and cluttered 3D environments such as forests, shrubbery or into balconies, garages, or sheds. Dense high-speed optical flow can provide real-time motion cues for obstacle avoidance that does not require 3D full reconstruction of the environment. However, classical reactive control does not `look ahead' and tends to bounce off obstacles rather than generating a smooth trajectory that anticipates and avoids upcoming obstacles. In this paper, we consider deriving a fully image based control criteria that forward predicts a cylinder of free space into the image flow representation of the environment and steers the vehicle by manoeuvering this cylinder through the upcoming environment. The length and radius of the cylinder provide a guarantee that the vehicle can indeed fly through the space identified and the fact that it is predicted forward into the environment leads to smooth anticipation of upcoming obstacles. Results are obtained for a quadrotor flying autonomously through a forest environment.",

Our network, dubbed the Visual-Inertial-Odometry Learner (VIOLearner), learns to perform visual-inertial odometry (VIO) without inertial measurement unit (IMU) intrinsic parameters (corresponding to gyroscope and accelerometer bias or white noise) or the extrinsic calibration between an IMU and camera. The network learns to integrate IMU measurements and generate hypothesis trajectories which are then corrected online according to the Jacobians of scaled image projection errors with respect to a spatial grid of pixel coordinates. We evaluate our network against state-of-the-art (SOA) visual-inertial odometry, visual odometry, and visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) approaches on the KITTI Odometry dataset [1] and demonstrate competitive odometry performance.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We address the problem of learning vision-based, collision-avoiding, and target-selecting controllers in 3D, specifically in underwater environments densely populated with coral reefs. Using a highly maneuverable, dynamic, six-legged (or flippered) vehicle to swim underwater, we exploit real time visual feedback to make close-range navigation decisions that would be hard to achieve with other sensors. Our approach uses computer vision as the sole mechanism for both collision avoidance and visual target selection. In particular, we seek to swim close to the reef to make observations while avoiding both collisions and barren, coral-deprived regions. To carry out path selection while avoiding collisions, we use monocular image data processed in real time. The proposed system uses a convolutional neural network that takes an image from a forward-facing camera as input and predicts unscaled and relative path changes. The network is trained to encode our desired obstacle-avoidance and reef-exploration objectives via supervised learning from human-labeled data. The predictions from the network are transformed into absolute path changes via a combination of a temporally-smoothed proportional controller for heading targets and a low-level motor controller. This system enables safe and autonomous coral reef navigation in underwater environments. We validate our approach using an untethered and fully autonomous robot swimming through coral reef in the open ocean. Our robot successfully traverses 1000 m of the ocean floor collision-free while collecting close-up footage of coral reefs.",

This paper presents a novel vision-based approach to achieve high performance tracking control of a Car-Like Mobile Robot (CLMR) with wheel skidding and slippage. A visual estimation algorithm is proposed to provide reliable position, velocity, skidding and slipping information to close the control loop. The stability of the proposed system can be guaranteed by Lyapunov method since the position tracking error and the estimation error converge to zero simultaneously. Simulation is made to validate the effectiveness of the developed controller in the presence of skidding and slipping with online visual estimator.",

The virtual rendering method provides the tool representation in image form, which makes it possible to measure the distance between the rendered tool and real tool from endoscopic stereo image streams.

This process is completed sequentially. First, terrain classification is completed by extracting key features from visual-spectrum images captured from an on-board camera using Haar wavelet transform to identify both color and textural information. These features are then classified using an ANN to identify grass, concrete, asphalt, gravel, and mulch. Using the terrain classes, the image is then analyzed using concepts from high dynamic range imagery to establish the solar irradiance map of the area. In this way, our sequential methodology presented allows unmanned vehicles to classify the terrain and map the irradiance of a given area with no prior knowledge. Whereas, the terrain classification can be used in determining energy consumption or traversability criteria and the irradiance map can be used to estimate the energy harvesting capabilities.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper describes a vision-based target tracking method for a skid-steer vehicle. With the development of deep reinforcement learning, many researchers have tried to generate an end-to-end policy to control the mobile robot from a raw pixel image data. However, the action in most research only concerns high-level decisions such as go straight, turn left and right. High-level decisions alone are not sufficient to precisely control platforms such as a skid-steer vehicle due to the lack of steering mechanism. Thus, unlike existing work, we aim to control the motor command for the wheels directly. To this end, we employ guided policy search (GPS) based on the general kinematic slip model for the skid-type robot. Furthermore, to prohibit the target from getting out of the camera field of view (FOV) in the training phase, we update local policy optimization with a FOV constraint and perform a pre-training to make the initial policy more efficient. Our method allows the skid-type robot to automatically acquire the vision-based tracking policy while local policies satisfy the FOV constraint during the training phase. We evaluate our method through both simulation and experiment with a skid-steer mobile robot. Finally, we test the performance of learned policy with a moving target in a new environment.",

We show that these data can be used to first create a system enabling high-accuracy localisation, and then to accurately predict the future motion of newly observed cars in the camera view. As a basis for the method we use a recently proposed system [1] for unsupervised motion prediction and extend it to a real-time visual tracking pipeline which can track vehicles through noise and extended occlusions using only a monocular camera. The system is tested using two large-scale datasets of San Francisco and New York City containing millions of frames. We demonstrate the performance of the system in a variety of traffic, time, and weather conditions. The presented system requires no manual annotation or knowledge of road infrastructure. To our knowledge, this is the first time a perception system based on a large-scale crowd-sourced maps has been evaluated at this scale.",

Multi-copters are ideal platforms to automate this expensive and tedious task. This video presents a system that enables a human operator to teach a visual inspection task to an autonomous aerial vehicle by simply demonstrating the task using a tablet. The system employs the Google Tango visual-inertial mapping framework as the only source of pose estimates, thus enabling operation in GPS-denied environments. In a first step the operator records the desired inspection path using the tablet. Inspection points are automatically inserted if the operator pauses, holding a viewpoint. The mapping framework then computes a feature-based localization map, which is shared with the robot. After take-off, the robot estimates its pose based on this map and plans a smooth trajectory through the way points defined by the operator. Furthermore, the system is able to track the global pose of other robots or the operator, localized in the same map, and follow them in real-time, while avoiding collision. This was demonstrated in the second part of the video, where the robot is following the operator in real-time through a hedge maze.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic balance control for humanoid robots encounters difficulties such as stability, speed, and smoothness. In most of the previous studies, joints act as controller of the Center of Mass (CoM)supported using a simplified mathematical model. Then, the stability of the motion is guaranteed using the Zero Moment Point (ZMP)stability criterion. In this video, a humanoid robot [1] will carry a tray secured to the wrist and the objects to be transported will be placed on the tray. This condition implies that the object is not grasped and therefore, the robot arm will be the only point of support of the object through the tray. Thus, the manipulation control system must be able to detect the stability of the object and act according to the different perturbations applied to it. A 3D balance control system for non-grasping tasks is presented and it is based on the ZMP criterion and 3D inverted pendulum equations. The perception system required is based on the use of Force-Torque sensors [2], computer vision [3], and their integration. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is being investigated with the humanoid robot TEO.",

Human gait motion is a whole-body exercise that includes both lower body and upper body motion. Therefore, focusing on trunk and pelvic rotational motion, assist and resist the walking by applying external forces. By introducing periodic input control, control the timing of the supplementary force, and assist the walking. As an experimental result, the walking assistance improves gait by decreasing energy loss, and the walking resistance applies a load during walking.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose methods for walking on a steep slope using a rope by a humanoid robot. There are two difficulties for walking on a steep slope without a rope. First, range of motion of ankle joints get limited. Second, feet of a robot slip on a steep slope. For these problems, using a rope is effective solution because the robot can receive enough friction force from the slope and walk on a steep slope by pulling a rope with proper tension. In addition, the robot pulling a rope on a slope can relax limitations of ankle joints. Therefore, we propose methods to determine tension of a grasped rope by solving a linear least-square problem considering deformability of a rope. With these methods, a life-size humanoid robot HRP-2 could walk on a steep slope which angle is 40 degree.",

To improve the quality of life of such patients, a pediatric gait exoskeleton was developed. The ATLAS exoskeleton has 8 active degrees of freedom (DOF): 2 at the hip (adduction/abduction and flexion/extension), 1 at the knee and ankle joint for flexion and extension. A feasibility test was performed to gauge the initial response of the patients. This study demonstrates that the exoskeleton was able to provide gait assistance and sit-to-stand movements effectively to the subjects. This kind of wearable exoskeleton will play a key role in the rehabilitation of SMA patients and delay further metabolic degeneration in the future.",

        "abstract": "In a human-robot interaction (HRI) device that performs physical collaboration operations in constant contact with the user, admittance control and impedance control are generally used. Since the two controllers exhibit opposite performances depending on the stiffness condition, controllers capable of dealing with various magnitudes of stiffness are required. As such, this study proposes hybrid control that adjusts the control distribution ratios of admittance control and impedance control based on the operating frequency analysis to react to the user intention and various stiffness conditions in real time. The proposed controller algorithm exhibited lower overshoot than impedance control in the step input response simulation, faster response speed compared to admittance control in the response simulation for 0-5 Hz input frequencies, and the smallest vibration magnitude and number of vibrations in the case of a virtual wall collision, resulting in improved performance compared to existing control methods.",

        "abstract": "In the received signal strength (RSS) based localization, a model-based calibration approach has been usually done by relating RSS-to-distance among anchor nodes. In this paper, an improved calibration method is proposed. For that purpose, RSS and estimated distance between any pairs of an-chor/unknown nodes is considered under the linear regression model. Unfortunately in this model, partial input elements are erroneous due to the inaccurate localization of unknown nodes. To obtain its solution under consideration of such an error, the weighted total least squares (WTLS) techniques are employed here. With the help of the WTLS techniques, several errors involved in the model can be effectively compensated. To show the efficiency of the proposed calibration, it is combined with several localization algorithms and its performance is verified by various simulations. The results show that the proposed calibration can give a very similar localization performance to that of each localization algorithm when true model parameters are known.",

The wireframe representation compactly represents geometry, in addition to transient situations such as occlusions and boundaries of unexplored regions. We formulate a particle filter to suit this sparse wireframe map structure. Functions for calculating the likelihood of scans, merging wireframes, and resampling are developed to accommodate this map representation. The wireframe structure with the particle filter allows for severe discrete map errors to be corrected, leading to accurate maps with small storage requirements. We show in a simulation study that the algorithm attains a map of an environment with 1 % error, compared to an occupancy grid map obtained with GMapping which attained 23% error with the same storage requirements. A simulation mapping a large environment demonstrates the algorithms scalability.",

This framework greatly improves the performance of standard online grasp planning algorithms by incorporating a notion of reachability into the online grasp planning process. Offline, a database of hundreds of thousands of unique end-effector poses were queried for feasibility. At runtime, our grasp planner uses this database to bias the hand towards reachable end-effector configurations. The bias keeps the grasp planner in accessible regions of the planning scene so that the resulting grasps are tailored to the situation at hand. This results in a higher percentage of reachable grasps, a higher percentage of successful grasp executions, and a reduced planning time. We also present experimental results using simulated and real environments.",

        "abstract": "Limitations with the on-board computational resources installed on untethered robots such as humanoids and mobile robots in general affects significantly the performance and capabilities of these machines. An approach to address this issue is to make use of the cloud robotics concept and take advantage of the extensive computational resources of the cloud. XBotCloud is a recently developed component of the XBot framework. It tackles the above challenges by introducing the tools and mechanisms to enable users and robots to exploit the computational resources of the cloud allowing the execution of services with low, soft or hard Real-Time execution/communication performance. The latter is ensured thanks to the functionality provided by the XBotCore Real-Time cross-robot software component of the XBot framework. XBotCloud addresses also one of the main challenges related with cloud robotics: security. To avoid remote attacks it takes advantage of the Amazon Web Services (AWS)Cloud Security and it uses an internal VPN Network to handle the connectivity between the robot and the cloud server. The full implementation of the framework is presented and its functionality is demonstrated in realistic tasks involving pipelines that mix the execution of cloud services with moderate execution time constraints and Real-Time modules running on the robot local control unit. XBotCloud performances and cross-robot flexibility are experimentally validated on two different robotic platforms, the WALK-MAN humanoid and the CENTAURO upper body/full-body.",

Often, it is desired that end-users implement further tasks to adapt the robotic application to their needs. These user-defined tasks have to meet safety and integrity constraints for protecting the robotic platform and its users. We introduce a verifiable task specification language (vTSL) that enables to automatically prove that a task specification satisfies a set of predefined or task-specific constraints. We illustrate our approach using an example of a self-driving vehicle for intra-logistics and report experiences with two commercial applications.",

        "abstract": "Limited perception capabilities underwater shrink the envelope of effective localization techniques that can be applied in this environment. Long-term localization in six degrees of freedom can only be achieved by combining different sources of information. A multiple vehicle underwater localization solution, for localizing an underwater mining vehicle and its support vessel, is presented in this paper. The surface vessel carries a short baseline network, that interact with the inverted ultra-short baseline, carried by the underwater mining vehicle. A multiple antenna GNSS system provides data for localizing the surface vessel and to georeference the short baseline array. Localization of the mining vehicle results from a data fusion approach, that combines multiple sources of sensor information using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) framework. The developed solutions were applied in the context of the \u00a1VAMOS! European project. Long-term real time position errors below 0.2 meters, for the underwater machine, and 0.02 meters, for the surface vessel, were accomplished in the field. All presented results are based on data acquired in a real scenario.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, we have observed a clear trend in the rapid rise of autonomous vehicles and robotics. One of the core technologies enabling these applications, Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM), imposes two main challenges: first, these workloads are computationally intensive and they often have real-time requirements; second, these workloads run on battery-powered mobile devices with limited energy budget. Hence, performance should be improved while simultaneously reducing energy consumption, two rather contradicting goals by conventional wisdom. Previous attempts to optimize SLAM performance and energy efficiency usually involve optimizing one function and fail to approach the problem systematically. In this paper, we first study the characteristics of visual inertial SLAM workloads on existing heterogeneous SoCs. Then based on the initial findings, we propose \u03c0-SoC, a heterogeneous SoC design that systematically optimize the IO interface, the memory hierarchy, as well as the the hardware accelerator. We implemented this system on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale MPSoC and was able to deliver over 60 FPS performance with average power less than 5 W.",

It is based on the Scratch programming language, but specifically design and created for Android OS. It is a visual programming concept that allows non-skilled operators to create programs. The application allows to monitor the tasks while it is being executed by overlapping real time information through augmented reality. The application includes a teach pendant screen that can be customized according to the operator needs at every moment. The application is designed for online programming and reprogramming; easy use of learn-by-demonstration methods; easy connection with the robot control and sensors systems; and safety-system integration. It aims to be intuitive, easy to use, and simple. The application has four main parts: customized teach pendant, robot programming IDE and simulator, manual-guidance interface and augmented-reality-based-monitoring system.",

The mood of the participants and different physiological parameters (i.e., galvanic skin response (GSR) and facial temperature variation) are extracted and analysed based on the condition, experimenter, and psychological questionnaires (i.e., TEQ, TEIQ, RST-PQ). This study was a between participants study with 23 participants. Our results show that multiple GSR parameters (e.g., latency, amplitude, number of peaks) differ significantly based on the condition and the experimenter the participants interacted with. The temperature variation in three regions of interest (i.e., forehead, left, and right periorbital regions) are good indicators of how ready an individual is to react in an unforeseen situation.",
