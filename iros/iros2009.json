        "abstract": "Recently, classical pairwise Structure From Motion (SfM) techniques have been combined with non-linear global optimization (Bundle Adjustment, BA) over a sliding window to recursively provide camera pose and feature location estimation from long image sequences. Normally called Visual Odometry, these algorithms are nowadays able to estimate with impressive accuracy trajectories of hundreds of meters; either from an image sequence (usually stereo) as the only input, or combining visual and propioceptive information from inertial sensors or wheel odometry. This paper has a double objective. First, we aim to illustrate for the first time how similar accuracy and trajectory length can be achieved by filtering-based visual SLAM methods. Specifically, a camera-centered Extended Kalman Filter is used here to process a monocular sequence as the only input, with 6DOF motion estimated. Features are kept live in the filter while visible as the camera explores forward, and are deleted from the state once they go out of view. This permits an increase in the number of tracked features per frame from tens to around a hundred. While improving the accuracy of the estimation, it makes computationally infeasible the exhaustive Branch and Bound search performed by standard JCBB for match outlier rejection. As a second contribution that overcomes this problem, we present here a RANSAC-like algorithm that exploits the probabilistic prediction of the filter. This use of prior information makes it possible to reduce the size of the minimal data subset to instantiate a hypothesis to the minimum possible of 1 point, greatly increasing the efficiency of the outlier rejection stage. Experimental results from real image sequences covering trajectories of hundreds of meters are presented and compared against RTK GPS ground truth. Estimation errors are about 1% of the trajectory for trajectories up to 650 metres.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Teleoperation has a long history in the robotics community and numerous bilateral teleoperation systems employing manipulators have been proposed in the literature. On the one hand, systems have been designed which employ commercial hardware and hence generally suffer from low update rates and high delays due to restrictions of commercial manipulator controllers and haptic device controllers. On the other hand, bilateral teleoperation systems designed by research institutions often provide only few degrees of freedom. Our 6DoF bilateral teleoperation system, however, combines the amenities of commercial hardware with a high performance distributed control architecture which enables us to achieve update rates of more than 2 kHz and delays in the range of only 100 \u00bfs. This paper focuses on the architecture of our system and demonstrates how to achieve this performance using commercial hardware. Moreover, we show why update rates of more than 1 kHz are essential for certain teleoperation tasks. Especially with high approach velocities and stiff environments, high update rates and low delays are key requirements for stability and thus for realistic haptic perception. We present experimental results demonstrating the influence of the update rate on system stability. These results not only highlight the benefits of high update rates but also give hints on how to estimate the update rate necessary to achieve stable teleoperation for a given environment stiffness.",

        "abstract": "In the growing field of collective robotics, spatial co-ordination between robots is often critical and usually achieved via local relative positioning sensors. We believe that range and bearing sensing, based on infrared technology, has the potential to fulfil the strict requirements of real-world collective robots. These requirements include: small size, light weight, large range, high refresh rate, immunity against tilting and misalignment, immunity against ambient light changes, and good range and bearing accuracy. Currently, there are no range and bearing systems that have been designed to cope with such strict requirements. This paper presents a custom range and bearing system, based on a novel cascaded filtering technology, complemented by hybrid infrared/Radio Frequency (RF) communication, which has been designed specifically to meet all these expectations. The system has been characterised and tested, proving its viability.",

At this scale, two major problems arise while performing manipulation tasks: the lack of 3D real time visual feedback, and the difficulty to determine the interaction forces. Therefore, indications must be provided to help the user perform a given task. In this paper, we provide the user with intuitive force feedback, to improve objects' manipulation using a haptic device. Our platform is composed of a tipless beam manipulator, which is deformed when forces are applied to it. These deformations are measured using a laser. The force information we provide to the user is based on the raw beam's deformation measurement, and mechanical properties of the probe. It does provide the operator with indications about the interaction forces. This approach is validated by performing lateral and longitudinal rolling operations using microspheres with a radius of 25-micrometers. 2D rolling telemanipulation at microscale with force feedback is successfully demonstrated.",

This algorithm considers that the three dimensional environment consists of a number of planes, at various ocean depths. The artificial island technique has the advantage of reducing the covering path length and the time cost for the robot, because it takes the correlation between every plane. In this paper, the concept of the artificial island technique is presented and its validity is proved under certain conditions. Through various simulations, we validate the efficiency in terms of the total path length and the running time of the AUV. An example of a complete three dimensional map obtained using this technique is provided.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel technique to register a set of two 3D laser scans obtained from a ground robot and a wall-climbing robot which operates on the ceiling to construct a complete map of the indoor environment. Traditional laser scan registration methods like the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm will not converge to a global minimum without a good initial estimate of the transformation matrix. Our technique uses an overhead camera on the wall-climbing robot to keep line of sight with the ground robot and solves the Perspective Three Point (P3P) Problem to obtain the transformation matrix between the wall-climbing robot and the ground robot, which serves as a good initial estimate for the ICP algorithm to further refine the transformation matrix. We propose a novel particle filter algorithm to identify the real pose of the wall-climbing robot out of up to four possible solutions to P3P problem using Grunert's algorithm. The initial estimate ensures convergence of the ICP algorithm to a global minimum at all times. The simulation and experimental results indicate that the resulting composite laser map is accurate. In addition, the vision-based approach increases the efficiency by reducing the number of iterations of the ICP algorithm.",

To gather the 3D data, we use a laser scanner, employing a nodding data acquisition system mounted on both real and simulated robots. Our segmentation algorithm comes up from the integration of computer vision techniques, allowing for a fast separation of points corresponding to different, not necessarily planar, surfaces. The subsequent extraction of geometrical features out of each region's points is done by means of least-squares fitting. A Maximum Incremental Probability algorithm formulated upon the Extended Kalman Filter provides 6D localization and produces a map of planar patches with a convex-hull based representation. Scenarios from the Unified System for Automation and Robot Simulation (USARSim), including world models from past RoboCup Rescue editions' arenas, have been utilized to conduct some of our experiments.",

        "abstract": "In this work we present the segmentation and classification of 3D hand trajectory. Curvatures features are acquired by (r, \u00bf, h) and the hand orientation is acquired by approximating the hand plane in 3D space. The 3D positions of the hand movement are acquired by markers of a magnetic tracking system. Observing humans movements we perform a learning phase using histogram techniques. Based on the learning phase is possible classify reach-to-grasp movements applying Bayes rule to recognize the way that a human grasps an object by continuous classification based on multiplicative updates of beliefs. We are classifying the hand trajectory by its curvatures and by hand orientation along the trajectory individually. Both results are compared after some trials to verify the best classification between these two kinds of segmentation. Using entropy as confidence level, we can give weights for each kind of classification to combine both, acquiring a new classification for results comparison. Using these techniques we developed an application to estimate and classify two possible types of grasping by the reach-to-grasp movements performed by humans. These reported steps are important to understand some human behaviors before the object manipulation and can be used to endow a robot with autonomous capabilities (e.g. reaching objects for handling).",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for multi-view 3D modeling of human bodies using virtual stereopsis. The algorithm expands and improves the method used in, but unlike that method, our approach does not require multiple calibrated cameras and/or carefully-positioned turn tables. Instead, an algorithm using SIFT feature extraction is employed and an accurate motion estimation is performed to calculate the position of virtual cameras around the object. That is, by employing a single pair of cameras mounted on a same tripod, our algorithm computes the relative pose between camera and object and creates virtual cameras from the consecutive images in the video sequence. Besides not requiring any special setup, another advantage of our method is in the simplicity to obtain denser models if necessary: by only increasing the number of sampled images during the object-camera motion. As the quantitative results presented here demonstrate, our method compares to the PMVS method, while it makes it much simpler and cost-effective to implement.",

        "abstract": "Most of traditional biped walkers based on passive dynamic walking have arc feet and locked ankle joints. In this paper, we propose the method to substitute the arc feet with flat feet. We hypothesize that the shape of the arc feet corresponds to a circular roll-over shape (ROS), which is a shape of a trajectory of center of pressure in the shank-fixed frame. Firstly, we show that ankle joints driven by flexible muscles antagonistically can generate a circular ROS by simple simulation and real robot experiments. Radius of the ROS can be controlled by tension of the muscles. Then, we demonstrate stable 3D limit cycle walking by a biped robot with flat feet using the proposed ROS controlling method. We also investigate its behavior and stability when extra load is added to the robot and verified that the stability of the robot is maintained by keeping the ROS. The results suggest that the ROS can be a stability measure for limit cycle walkers to realize adaptive walking.",

Our system is based on the probabilistic alignment of 3D point clouds employing a delayed-state information-form SLAM algorithm, for which we can add observations of relative robot displacements efficiently. These observations come from the alignment of dense range data point clouds computed with a variant of the iterative closest point algorithm. The datasets were acquired with our custom built 3D range scanner integrated into a mobile robot platform. Our mapping results are compared to a GIS-based CAD model of the experimental site. The results show that our approach to 3D mapping performs with sufficient accuracy to derive traversability maps that allow our service robots navigate and accomplish their assigned tasks on a urban pedestrian area.",

The sequential acquisition of regions of interest has a double benefit on visual servoing. The first one is that this acquisition method allows to increase the visual control sampling frequency by reducing the data amount to acquire and to transmit by the camera. The second one is that the associated image projection model depends on the observed object pose and velocity. Thanks to this property, a new vision-based control law can be defined. The particularity of this control law is that the control output consists of the kinematic and the dynamic twists. This allows to enhance the control performance in trajectory tracking applications. The experimental results in high speed visual tracking application show the effectiveness of this approach.",

The very low signal-to-noise ratio and low spatial resolution still limits severely BCIs communication bandwidth. This paper presents the ongoing work toward the development of a BCI system for wheelchair steering. A full system based on a visual P300 oddball paradigm is proposed. The signal processing algorithms are computationally efficient and require a short phase training. Temporal features and EEG channels are selected through a Fisher criteria. For enhancement of signal-to-noise ratio and data dimensionality reduction, a spatial filter named Common Spatial Patterns is applied. This method is widely used for classification of motor imagery events, however it is not very often used for classification of event related potentials such as P300. In this paper we show that Common Spatial Patterns is an effective approach to improve P300 classification rates. In our approach, the input features for classification are the projections of the filtered data instead of the variance of the projections as typically used in motor imagery. Offline classification results, obtained with a Bayesian classifier, are presented showing the effectiveness of the overall methodology.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In recent years, anytime algorithms have shown to be a good solution for planning a path in domains with severe restrictions regarding the time for deliberation. They typically operate by quickly finding a highly suboptimal path first, and then improving it until the available time runs out. In this paper, we propose a novel anytime approach called ABUG that performs much more efficiently than the competing strategies. ABUG is based on an improved version of a member of the popular family of algorithms known as Bug. A formal analysis of the planner is provided and several relevant properties of ABUG are identified. Besides, as done in some heuristic-based anytime approaches, we define bounds on the quality/length of the paths returned by the algorithm. Finally, in order to demonstrate the computational savings associated with the proposal, a comparative study involving a set of well-known path-planning techniques is also carried out.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The ultimate success of a human-robot-interface system depends on how accurately user control signals are classified. This paper is aimed at developing and testing a strategy to accurately classify human-robot control signals. The primary focus is on overcoming the dimensionality problem frequently encountered in the design of Gaussian multivariate signal classifiers. The dimensionality problem is overcome by selecting, using two different ranking criteria, a small set of linear combinations of the input signal space generated by the discrete cosine transform (DCT). The application of the resulting DCT-Gaussian signal classification strategy is demonstrated by classifying tongue-movement ear-pressure (TMEP) bioacoustic signals that have been proposed for control of an assistive robotic arm. Classification results show that the DCT-Gaussian classifiers outperform classifiers described in a previous study. Most noteworthy is the fact that the Gaussian multivariate control signal classifiers developed in this paper can be designed without having to collect a prohibitively large number of training signals in order to satisfy the dimensionality conditions. Consequently, the classification strategies will be especially beneficial for designing personalized assistive interfaces for individuals from whom only a limited number of training signals can reliably be collected due to severe disabilities.",

We assume that each robot has access to its local network geometry, which is the combination of a robot's network connectivity and the positions of its neighbors measured relative to itself. Our algorithm uses this information to classify robots as boundary or interior in one communications round, which is fast enough for rapidly changing networks. We use the local boundary classifications to create a robust boundary subgraph, and to determine if the boundary is an interior void or the exterior boundary. A proof of the key property of the boundary detection algorithm is provided, and all the algorithms are extensively tested on a swarm of 25-35 robots in rapidly changing network topologies.",

The system has some unique characteristics, among which it requires very few computational resources as a consequence of its extreme simplicity. In spite of this, it is formally demonstrated to be asymptotically stable, as well as computationally efficient to be implemented in real-world scenarios where obstacles are not known, and possibly move in the environment.",

In field conditions, significant uncertainty is associated with terrain and/or vehicle parameter estimates, and this must be considered in an analysis of robot motion. Here a Multi-Element generalized Polynomial Chaos (MEgPC) approach is presented that explicitly considers vehicle parameter uncertainty for long term estimation of robot dynamics. It is shown to be an improvement over the generalized Askey polynomial chaos framework as well as the standard Monte Carlo scheme, and can be used for efficient, accurate prediction of robot dynamics.",

The Whegs\u00bf robotic platform, with its demonstrated capability to negotiate obstacles and traverse irregular terrain, is a good candidate for a lunar rover concept. In this research, Lunar Whegs\u00bf is constructed as a proof-of-concept rover that would be able to navigate the surface of the moon, collect a quantity of regolith, and transport it back to a central processing station. The robot incorporates an actuated scoop, specialized feet for locomotion on loose substrates, light detection and ranging (LIDAR) obstacle sensing and avoidance, and sealing and durability features for operation in an abrasive environment.",

In addition, a statistical study was conducted to confirm the repeatability and reliability of our sensor network. Results demonstrate that the sensor system has strong potential to be used as a low-cost tool for motion capture, and objective arm function evaluation for both short-term and long-term monitoring.",

The resulting paths are practically optimal and experimental results show a great reduction of the searching time, making it possible to implement a real-time global path planner in a very large environment.",

This system is based on dimensionality reduction techniques and Support Vector Machines, allowing the system to learn to separate between acceptable and unacceptable welding results within one batch, and to transfer this ability to a batch with different workpiece properties. It does not aim at a complete and general relationship between all process variables and result quantities, since it has been demonstrated that this is not necessary to reduce significantly the costs of calibrating the welding system. The main objective is to examine a cognitive system that stabilizes robotic welding processes by learning how to improve at least one process steering variable. In order to evaluate and improve the cognitive system, an extensive experimental setup is realized and described. The ability to learn and autonomously adapt to changes in workpiece properties allows the system to reduce the time an expert needs, and relaxes the requirements with respect to workpiece tolerances.",

The unidirectional impulse force generator is a simple mechanical device for generating high-frequency impulse forces toward a certain direction unilaterally utilizing snap-through bucklings. The proposed kick-and-bounce robot has a pair of the unidirectional impulse force generators as the muscles of its biped legs. The robot moves forward rapidly by the repetition of the kicks and bounces to the ground. We show that the developed palm-top mobile robot whose weight is of only 67[g] achieves the velocity of 0.8[m/s] instantaneously.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of creating an objective benchmark for comparing SLAM approaches. We propose a framework for analyzing the results of SLAM approaches based on a metric for measuring the error of the corrected trajectory. The metric uses only relative relations between poses and does not rely on a global reference frame. The idea is related to graph-based SLAM approaches in the sense that it considers the energy needed to deform the trajectory estimated by a SLAM approach to the ground truth trajectory. Our method enables us to compare SLAM approaches that use different estimation techniques or different sensor modalities since all computations are made based on the corrected trajectory of the robot. We provide sets of relative relations needed to compute our metric for an extensive set of datasets frequently used in the SLAM community. The relations have been obtained by manually matching laser-range observations. We believe that our benchmarking framework allows the user an easy analysis and objective comparisons between different SLAM approaches.",

Estimating TTC is difficult because it requires a stable and reliable estimate of the rate of change of distance between image features. In this paper we propose a new method to measure time to contact, active contour affine scale (ACAS). We experimentally and analytically compare ACAS with two other recently proposed methods: scale invariant ridge segments (SIRS), and image brightness derivatives (IBD). Our results show that ACAS provides a more accurate estimation of TTC when the image flow may be approximated by an affine transformation, while SIRS provides an estimate that is generally valid, but may not always be as accurate as ACAS, and IBD systematically over-estimate time to contact.",

However, such a task is faced with a number of challenges, including noisy underwater environments, limitation on size and complexity of localization hardware, and constraints on computing capabilities of sensor platforms. In this paper we present a sliding-window discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based algorithm for precise detection of the arrival of a monotone acoustic signal, as a key enabling step in measuring the time of flight (TOF) of the acoustic signal for localization of the sensor node. The algorithm accommodates the rise dynamics of the signal and compensates for the latency in detection given the signal model, detection threshold, and steady-state signal amplitude. The algorithm is implemented onboard a small biomimetic robotic fish, and experiments in an indoor pool have shown that the proposed method results in an underwater ranging error of 1.4 wavelengths (74.3 cm), and is thus promising for localization of dense aquatic networks. The proposed method has also shown robustness in comparison with other tested methods including a matched filter-type method.",

The integration is very generic and can work with an arbitrary set of modalities.

As examples of cross-modal interaction we describe mechanisms for clarification and visual learning.",

Secondly, structuring the required functions for the proposed system is discussed. Third, the overview of the constructed system configuration is illustrated. Fourth, the problem of the stone motion tracking by ultrasonography is clarified. To cope with this problem, the respiratory motion of a human kidney is analyzed and a controller, by utilizing the quasi-periodical motion of the respiratory kidney motion, is proposed. Finally, the result of the servoing and HIFU irradiation experiments of the model stone, which moves based on the real human kidney motion data, is reported to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed controller and the constructed system.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of planning collision-free motions for general (i.e., possibly nonholonomic) redundant robots subject to task space constraints. Previous approaches to the solution are based on the idea of sampling and inverting the task constraint to build a roadmap of task-constrained configurations which are then connected by simple local paths; hence, task tracking is not enforced during the motion between samples. Here, we present a control-based randomized approach relying on a motion generation scheme that guarantees continued satisfaction of such constraint. The resulting planner allows to achieve accurate execution of the desired task without increasing the size of the roadmap. Numerical results on a fixed-base manipulator and a free-fying mobile manipulator are presented to illustrate the performance improvement obtained with the proposed technique.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an approach for the closed-loop control of actuated biped that allows natural looking and energy efficient walking. Rather than prescribe kinematic trajectories or kinematic constraints, the approach is based on the prescription of state dependent torques that \u201cencourage\u201d patterned movement. Some of the prescribed torques are referenced to the inertial reference frame, which largely decouples the angular dynamics of the robot, and as such greatly simplifies the selection of control parameters. Implementation of torques from the inertial coordinate frames is enabled by a joint torque computation which is motivated by Gauss's principle of least constraint. The proposed approach is implemented in simulation on an anthropomorphic biped, and is shown to quickly converge to a natural looking gait limit cycle. Simulations are conducted with various control parameters and different initial conditions. The authors also show that walking speed can be altered in a simple manner by varying two intuitive controller parameters. The mechanical cost of transport computed on a representative dynamic walk is used to validate energy efficiency of the proposed control approach.",

On the other hand, we have derived a mathematical model of driver's perceptual risk of proximity in car following situation and successfully derived driver deceleration model to describe deceleration patterns and brake initiation timing of expert driver. In this research, an automatic braking system for collision avoidance will be proposed based on the formulated brake profile model and brake initiation model of expert driver to realize smooth, secure brake assistance naturally. It will be shown that the proposed control method can generate smooth profile for various conditions. In addition, experimental results using a driving simulator will show validity of the proposed system based on subjective evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Highly underactuated and passively adaptive robotic hands have shown great promise for robust performance in unstructured settings. In order to fully realize this potential, efficient tools are needed to analyze the execution of a grasp when using this class of devices. Along this line, this paper introduces a quasistatic analysis method for underactuated hands. First, we predict whether initial contacts between the fingers and the object are stable throughout the execution of a grasp, or the fingers will slip as the hand closes. Second, we compute the unbalanced forces applied to the object during the grasping process. Finally, once the grasp is complete, we analyze its stability as actuator forces are increased. These computations are performed in 3D, allow arbitrary kinematic structure of the fingers or geometry of the target object and take into account frictional constraints. We discuss applications of this method focusing on both on-line computation to execute a specific grasping task and off-line optimization to increase the range of grasps that can be performed using a given hand model.",

Then, collision free formation transition trajectories are computed using discrete event scheduling techniques that have been well-established in the manufacturing systems domain. The main contribution of this paper is a unified formation control framework that explicitly takes obstacles into account. Using discrete event system analysis tools we show that our approach guarantees convergence to the desired formation while avoiding obstacles and inter-agent collisions.",

The approach is based on the choice of a particular class of walk configurations that enables a full state controllability avoiding the need to use Poincare-like argumentation in the proof of motion's reproducibility (stability of limit cycles). Simulation results attest the efficiency of the proposed control approach.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a system architecture that extends the current state-of-the-art in computational visual attention by incorporating the biological concept of ventral attention. According to recent findings regarding the neurobiological foundations of attention, there exist two separate but interacting attention systems in the human brain: the dorsal attention system and the ventral attention system. As opposed to the well-known computational concepts of bottom-up and top-down saliency, which both correspond to the dorsal attention system, the ventral attention system is sensitive to behavior-relevant stimuli that are unexpected (i.e. not top-down salient), independent of their perceptual saliency (bottom-up saliency). This results in a dynamic interplay between top-down saliency, bottom-up saliency and ventral attention in the proposed system architecture, enabling the system to redirect its focus of attention to important stimuli while being absorbed in a task, even if their perceptual saliency is low. Our technical system instance implementing the proposed architecture integrates several state-of-the-art methods in a coherent system and concentrates on unexpected motion as a first technical account of ventral attention. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the ventral attention enables our system to detect and reorient to important situations in real-world traffic environments that are relevant for the behavior of driving.",

        "abstract": "In this study, a novel dynamic path planning approach is proposed for multi-robot sensor-based coverage considering energy capacities of the mobile robots. The environment is assumed to be narrow and partially unknown. A Generalized Voronoi diagram-based network is used for the sensor-based coverage planning due to narrow nature of the environment. On the other hand, partially unknown nature is handled with proposed dynamic re-planning approach. Initially, the robots are assumed to be at the same depot with equal initial energy capacities. In this case, an initial complete coverage route is constructed considering robot energy capacities using classical capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) approach with some minor modifications related to coverage problem. But, due to partially unknown nature, the robots may face with blockage on routes, and a fast re-planning is required which considers remaining energy capacities and current positions of the robots. So, new plan is obtained by a modifying Ulusoy's algorithm that was developed for classical CARP. The developed algorithm is coded in C++ and implemented on P3-DX mobile robots in MobileSim simulation environment.",

        "abstract": "Entry position of the graft is very important in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. However the determination of entry position is very difficult to the surgeon. In this paper, a navigation and evaluation system assisted by the 6-DOFS robot is implemented for the simulation evaluation and planning insertion points based on quadrant method for the femur and St\u00e4ublis method for the tibia on the lateral X-ray image of knee joint. Meanwhile, the implementation of the key technologies such as image correction, image registration, C-arm calibration, video tracking, bone surface reconstruction, image fusion, 6-DOFS robot, and virtual simulation are introduced. Finally, Experiments about the tunnel planning method and real time tracking of surgical apparatus are implemented on 8 bone of plastic models (Sawbone, Swiss) and 10 bones of the goat. In the experiment, the tibia rotates around the femur under the surgeon's implementation to evaluate the planning result with the virtual simulation and evaluation module. The positioning error is 1.59mm from analysis on 30 space targets. The virtual reconstruction ACL is satisfied with two important criteria of the best isometry and collision detection between graft and intercondylar surface of femur. The results are well accepted in operations. In order to satisfying with the request of exact operation in ACL reconstruction, we have developed 6-DOFS passive robot to assist the surgeons entry positioning and drilling of implant tunnels, implementing exact operation in knee joint.",

        "abstract": "Assistive mobile robots that can navigate autonomously can greatly benefit people with mobility impairments. Since an assistive mobile robot transports a human user from one place to another, its motion should be comfortable for human users. Moreover, it should be possible for users to customize the motion according to their comfort. While there exists a large body of work on motion planning for mobile robots, very little attention has been paid to characterizing comfort and planning comfortable trajectories. In this paper, we first characterize comfortable motion by formulating a measure of discomfort as a weighted sum of the total travel time and time integrals of various kinematic quantities. We then present a method for factoring the weights such that once a user has customized the weights for one task, the same choice of weights leads to similar average value of the discomfort measure in other tasks. We seek trajectories that minimize the discomfort and satisfy boundary conditions on pose, velocity and acceleration. Such a problem can naturally be formulated as a variational optimization problem. Unlike previous work, we present a comprehensive formulation that allows the travel time to be unspecified and includes boundary conditions on position, orientation, velocity and acceleration. This makes the formulation very general as it can be used to compute trajectories for various kinds of tasks, such as starting from rest, coming to rest, moving from one specified velocity to another, arriving at a goal with a specified orientation etc. Finally, we present a fast and robust numerical method for solving the minimization problem.",

In order to alleviate this, we have so far proposed a design scheme for local sensory feedback control based on so-called discrepancy function that extracts the discrepancies between body (i.e., mechanical system), brain (i.e., control system) and environments. This paper intensively investigates the validity of this design scheme by taking a two-dimensional serpentine robot exhibiting undulatory slithering locomotion as a practical example. Preliminary simulation results derived strongly indicate that our design methodology allows us to endow the robot with highly adaptability and fault tolerance. These results obtained are expected to shed a new light on design methodology for autonomous decentralized control system. Furthermore, together with a validity verification of the simulation results, this paper introduces a real two-dimensional serpentine robot that is currently under development.",

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to passive RFID, which tackles those issues using fuzzy reasoning. Specifically, first, we present a fuzzy antenna model. Then, based on this model, we describe two fuzzy logic methods for tag localization. One allows us to accurately localize passive tags in the environment and to generate what we call an RFID-augmented map; the other is suited for estimating the bearing of a tag relative to the robot. The general use of both methods is in object localization, map building, environment monitoring, and robot pose estimation. Results of experimental tests demonstrate that fuzzy logic is appropriate to operate under uncertainty in RFID systems, and allows for accurate tag localization.",

A stride control of the system based on the user's intension is important to coordinate the voluntary movements of the user and the assisted movements of the paralyzed legs. In this paper, we propose a human interface with a walker to control the stride length of a legged locomotor device. Assuming that a intended stride is equal to a distance of the preceding movement of the walker, we developed a human interface estimating the movement distance of the walker, where the distance is calculated by polynomial fitting for the acceleration of the movement. In this study, we examine the proposed human interface from the measurement experiments of gait movements, and report the following results: (1) estimation accuracy by polynomial fitting method, and (2) feasibility of the adjustment of stride length using the proposed method. These results suggest that the proposed human interface is effective to adjust the stride length of a legged locomotor device.",

Due to the fact that line segments are principal elements of artificial environments, they provide considerable geometric information about the environment which can be used for enhancing the accuracy of localization. Orthogonal characteristic of line features is the key issue to guarantee the consistency of the SLAM algorithm by allowing us to deal with lines that are parallel or perpendicular to each other. This behavior allows us to sample robot poses more correctly. As a result, the proposed algorithm can close bigger loops with the same number of particles.

        "abstract": "For an autonomous vehicle navigating in a static environment for which an a priori map is inaccurate, we propose a hybrid receding horizon control method to determine optimal routes when new obstacles are detected. The hybrid method uses the level sets of the solution to either a global or local Eikonal equation in the formulation of the receding horizon control problem. Whenever an obstacle is detected along the path of the autonomous vehicle, a solution to a local Eikonal equation is used to determine whether a new, global Eikonal equation must be solved for use in the receding horizon optimization problem. The decision to select a new level set solution is made based on certain matching conditions that guarantee the optimality of the path. The selection of a global or local solution to the Eikonal equation induces a hybrid system structure in the control formulation. We rigorously prove sufficient conditions that guarantees that the vehicle will converge to the goal as long as the goal is accessible. In the end, simulation results are discussed.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a strategy for a dual-arm robot to pick up a specific part of clothing with one hand while holding the item of clothing with its other hand. Due to the large deformability of clothing, the handling requirements differ from those required for the handling of rigid objects. In the case of holding a specific part of clothing, large deformation leads to a large variety of positions and orientations of the target part, requiring flexibility of both visual recognition and motion control. On the other hand, since the clothing can flexibly curve over the hand, a relatively large range of suitable actions is allowed for grasping the clothing. By considering these characteristics, the following three-stage strategy is proposed. First, the state of the clothing is recognized from visual observation of the clothing using a deformable-model [1]. Then, the theoretically optimal position and orientation of the hand for handling a specific part of the clothing is calculated based on the recognition results. Finally, the position and orientation of the hand is modified by considering the executable motion range of the dual arms. Preliminary experimental results using actual observations of a humanoid robot were used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.",

First, edge detection and improved Hough transform are used to select line segments, the region including regular-array line segments in image is considered as region of interesting (ROI). ROI detection is the base for recognition. Target geometry shape is extracted from ROI using optimum threshold segmentation, which removes location effect and improves efficiency. As calculating shape principal orientations, all shapes are rotated to the same horizontally right to avoid rotation effect. The features extracted from shape implement multi-levels representation with moment features, normalized moment of inertia, length-width ratio and compact ration. Finally, feature vectors are normalized to measure similarity between target and template. Experiments show that target regions can be located accurately using ROI detection and it is effective for target recognition. Besides, the extracted features have good invariability with respect to rotation, translation and scaling, and they comprise local and overall consistency of the target, therefore, the recognition results meet expectations well.",

After a weighted evaluation of these different solutions, we present a spherical system with a mass of 9.8g and a diameter of 12cm that is able to jump, upright itself after landing and jump again. In order to do so autonomously, it has a control unit and sensors to detect its orientation and spring charging state.

        "abstract": "Most autopilots of existing miniature unmanned air vehicles (MUAVs) rely on control architectures that typically use a large number of sensors (gyros, accelerometers, magnetometers, GPS) and a computationally demanding estimation of flight states. As a consequence, they tend to be complex, require a significant amount of processing power and are usually expensive. Many research projects that aim at experiments with one, or even several, MUAVs would benefit from a simpler, potentially smaller, lighter and less expensive autopilot for their flying platforms. In this paper, we present a minimalist control strategy for fixed-wing MUAVs that provides the three basic functionalities of airspeed, altitude and heading turnrate control while only using two pressure sensors and a single-axis rate gyro. To achieve this, we use reactive control loops, which rely on direct feedback from the sensors instead of full state information. In order to characterize the control strategy, it was implemented on a custom-made autopilot. With data recorded during flight experiments, we carried out a statistical analysis of step responses to altitude and turnrate commands as well as responses to artificial perturbations.",

In the scenario, the sizes of the time delays is not only stochastic, but it is also large compared to the task execution time. The method proposed uses minimum jerk motion models to predict the input from the user a time into the future that is equivalent to the one-way communication delay. We present results from a teleoperated ball-catching experiment with real internet delays, where we show that the proposed method makes a significant improvement over traditional methods for teleoperation over intercontinental distances.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a tracked robot composed of the proposed crawler mechanism, in which a planetary gear reducer is employed as the transmission device and provides two outputs in different forms with only one actuator. When the crawler moves in a rough environment, collision between mechanism and environment inevitably occurs. This under-actuated crawler can absorb the impact energy that should be transmitted to the actuator. A modular concept for the crawler is proposed for enlarging its use in robot systems and mechanical design of a modular crawler is conducted. Using this crawler module, a four-crawler-driven robot is realized by easily assembling. Experiments are conducted to verify the proposed concept and mechanical design. A single crawler module can well perform the proposed three locomotion modes. The four-crawler-driven robot has good adaptability to the environment which can get over obstacles both passively and actively.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a robotic walker system with standing, walking and seating assistance function. Our system focuses on domestic use for aged person who needs nursing in their daily life. Our key ideas are two topics. The first topic is combination of standing assistance function and walking assistance function. In previous works, many assistance devices are specialized in only \u00bfstanding-up operation\u00bf or \u00bfwalking operation\u00bf. However, in their daily life, elderly people need standing, walking and seating assistance continuously by the same device. Therefore, our developing assistance system can support both operations by a small sized mechanism which is easy to use in the home. The second topic is a seating position adjustment assistance. From questionnaires of nursing specialists, a seating position adjustment requires the elderly people to walk backward and it is difficult operation for them. Furthermore, in many cases, a failure of this operation causes a fracture which has high risk to fall into bedridden life. Thus, our developing system can assist the aged users to adjust the seating position safety. The performance of our proposed system is verified by experiments using our prototype.",

Instead of using a heuristic approach to accept or reject loop closing, we propose a probabilistically grounded multi-hypothesis technique that relies on the incremental construction of a map/state hypothesis tree. Loop closing is introduced automatically within the tree expansion, and likely hypotheses are chosen based on their posterior probability after a sequence of sensor measurements. Careful pruning of the hypothesis tree keeps the growing number of hypotheses under control and a recursive formulation reduces storage and computational costs. Experiments are used to validate the approach.",

Traditional approaches to making robots at this size scale require the use of expensive start-up equipment and/or precise machining, and generally yield fragile and costly robots in small numbers. The multi-material milli-robot prototyping process uses Loctite\u00ae polymer products and photolithography to rapidly fabricate robust, inexpensive, and compliant robots only centimeters in size. In this paper, the process flow is described and characterized with minimum feature sizes of 0.25mm in polymer layers 0.18mm thick. Both commercial and ink-jet printed masks are used for the photolithography steps. Finally, a functional inchworm robot and a small gripper have been designed and demonstrated with Nitinol shape memory alloy (SMA) used for actuation. The gripper is 1.2 g and costs 3.21 in small numbers while the inchworm robot is 7.4 g and costs 3.21 in small numbers while the inchworm robot is 7.4 g and costs 7.76 in small numbers.

The mobile robot has a handrail to assist the elderly to walk safely and stably. In this application, adaptive motion compliance is required in accordance with the applied force of the user. Practical experimental results show that the compliance of the walking helper can be adjusted by setting dynamic coefficients of the overall dynamical system. It was demonstrated that the external force observer successfully detected the pushing as well as pulling force of a user on the handrail. The velocity of the omni-directional walking helper is adjusted according to the inferred motion intent.",

        "abstract": "Aiming to real easy application in several quadruped robot platforms, this paper introduces a new method of modeling central pattern generators (CPG) to control quadruped locomotion. Not only can this new model generate all the primary gaits of quadrupeds stably with limit cycle effect, but it also has the ability of tuning the periodic outputs with arbitrary waveforms. The core idea is to combine strong points of two mathematical tools: Fourier series and Recurrent neural networks. In addition, a new biomimetic controller is also introduced using the proposed CPG model and several reflex modules. Finally, dynamic simulations are performed to validate the efficiency of the proposed controller.",

The increased mobility of tumbling robots, however, comes at the price of increased control complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel method to handle the issues of tumbling locomotion which takes the problem and separates into locally independent subproblems. Our approach provides an intuitive geometric solution to the tumbling control problem without sacrificing performance. We provide a running example throughout the paper to help solidify the ideas presented.",

        "abstract": "Sensorless localization of 3D objects has been a significant research topic for many years. Researchers have focused on this problem from both theoretical and practical perspective where the goal is to reduce uncertainties in the orientation of a 3D object. However, to the best of our knowledge, no effective practical methods have been proposed so far to localize a polyhedron from any initial orientation to a unique orientation without sensors. In our previous work [1], two broad classes of 3D objects have been introduced, which can be localized from an arbitrary state to a unique state on a flat plane (the surface resting on the flat plane is established) without sensors. In this paper, a much broader class of polyhedra is introduced, which can be localized to a unique state without sensors. The main contributions of this paper are given as follows: \u2022 It is found that a polyhedron with an arbitrary initial state on the flat plane can be rotated to a fixed orientation (the orientation of the surface resting on the flat plane is fixed), provided that the polygon corresponding to each surface of the polyhedron can be oriented to a unique orientation in a 2D space. The method of rotating the polyhedron to a fixed orientation is given. \u2022 Base on the above result, both conditions and the strategy are given for a polyhedron to be localized to a unique state. \u2022 An example is given to show the validity of the strategy.",

The proposed sensor is designed to detect tissue abnormalities within soft tissue surfaces. This is achieved by rolling over soft tissue in a virtually frictionless manner due to the design of the sensor in which the sensing element, a sphere, rests on a cushion of air. This design allows for rapid acquisition of tactile and mechanical properties of large areas of soft tissue. Laboratory experiments are carried out to show its feasibility as a tactile sensor for MIS and its behaviour under loading. The outcomes of the experiments illustrate the sensor's capability and potential as a tactile sensor for MIS. These results are discussed and future work is outlined.",

Both of training approaches are same that coordination motion of two hands is needed. We want to re-examine how effective the haptic sensory and visual sensory are in training of upper limbs. Further, we enhance the effect of system through adding assistance in order to help mild stroke patients to recovery. This system is convenient and compact so that it is suitable for home-based rehabilitation.",

This information is enough for the controller to follow the object by moving a two axis servo-platform, regardless the UAV vibrations and movements. The two Fuzzy controllers for each axis, work with a rules-base of 49 rules, two inputs and one output with a more significant sector defined to improve the behavior of those controllers. The controllers have shown very good performances in real flights for statics objects, tested on the Colibri prototypes.",

While many proposed methods focus on efficiency or on online computation, less interest has been devoted to investigate a parallel or distributed organization of such algorithms in the perspective of multi-robot exploration. In this paper, we propose a parallel algorithm for map estimation based on Gauss-Seidel relaxation. The map is given in the form of a constraints network and is partioned into clusters of nodes by applying a node-tearing technique. The identified clusters of nodes can be processed independently as tasks assigned to different processors. The graph decomposition induces also a hierarchical organization of nodes that could be exploited for more sophisticated relaxation techniques. Results illustrate the potential and flexibility of the new approach.",

A path is considered feasible if these kinematic constraints are not violated. The smoothness vehicle's acceleration profile is indirectly guaranteed between two points.

It is the condition under which the object is trapped so that there is no feasible path for the object from the given position to any position that is beyond a specified threshold distance during the transportation. We proposed the concept of dynamic object closure for achieving object caging task that robots team is able to cage a moving object after a predefined time interval. In the paper, a method planning caging path and by using random caging formation path determination algorithm (RCFP) is proposed for achieving dynamic object closure.

        "abstract": "Efficient methods have so far been proposed for planning dynamically stable walking pattern for humanoid robots. However, to guarantee that the reference joint trajectory will produce a safe movement despite modeling errors and perturbations, a stabilizer needs to be implemented on the robot. Though this stabilizer constitutes an essential part of the control strategy of most advanced humanoid platform, it is usually not open-source and dedicated to the own robot characteristics. The goal of this paper is to propose a general and practical strategy for designing a stabilizer for joint-position controlled humanoid robots. The proposed method is based on a double inverted pendulum model and a decoupling approach thanks to which the position of the ZMP and the center of gravity can be controlled independently through the regulation of the ankle and hip joints. The stabilizer generates the expected stabilizing torques from the admissible joint position input. The resulting control algorithm is fast and can be easily executed on the robot. This algorithm was successfully implemented as real-time plugins for the OpenHRP simulator of the HRP2. Simulations showing the efficiency of the method are presented and discussed.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are an indispensable tool for marine scientists to study the world's oceans. The Slocum glider is a buoyancy driven AUV designed for missions that can last weeks or even months. Although successful, its hardware and layered control architecture is rather limited and difficult to program. Due to limits in its hardware and software infrastructure, the Slocum glider is not able to change its behavior based on sensor readings while underwater. In this paper, we discuss a new programming architecture for AUVs like the Slocum. We present a new model that allows marine scientists to express AUV missions at a higher level of abstraction, leaving low-level software and hardware details to the compiler and runtime system. The Slocum glider is used as an illustration of how our programming architecture can be implemented within an existing system. The Slocum's new framework consists of an event driven, finite state machine model, a corresponding compiler and runtime system, and a hardware platform that interacts with the glider's existing hardware infrastructure. The new programming architecture is able to implement changes in glider behavior in response to sensor readings while submerged. This crucial capability will enable advanced glider behaviors such as underwater communication and swarming. Experimental results based on simulation and actual glider deployments off the coast of New Jersey show the expressiveness and effectiveness of our prototype implementation.",

It involves several applications such as determination of specific parameters (attitude, acceleration, and position) via a new generation of mechatronic systems. The aim of this paper concerns the animal motion estimation problem using low-cost sensors fusion. A quaternion-based nonlinear observer for the tracking of rigid body attitude (orientation) and heading using measurements provided from low cost inertial and magnetic sensors is presented. The algorithm combines low-frequency, 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis magnetometer, data with high frequency 3-axis gyroscope measurement. Then, to increase the performance and reduce the computational requirements, we exploit the sensor readings directly in the designed observer. Using the estimated attitude, the linear acceleration is then derived. This latter will be used in the future to evaluate the animal energy index and its mechanical work. Finally, some experimental results, using the measurements provided by an inertial sensor put on dog are given to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the design and implementation of DAVID, a lunar vehicle developed for the European Space Agency (ESA) Lunar Robotics Challenge, presenting severe terrain negotiation and sample acquisition challenges. We discuss in some detail two of the main innovative aspects of our entry to the challenge, i.e. the locomotion system and the sample acquisition system. Motivated by the challenge specifications, a range of different locomotion systems were considered, among which we chose a simple, rugged and effective wheeled system. We provide an account of the choice of five different types of wheels, which were designed, analyzed and experimentally tested in conditions similar to the challenge. The system eventually turned out to be very effective in negotiating 89% slopes of volcanic terrain on the challenge site, Mount Teide in Tenerife. To reduce the distance to be traveled on the difficult terrain and avoid risks in reaching the lowest parts of a crater, the vehicle was endowed with an innovative sample acquisition system, i.e. a casting manipulator. Casting manipulation is a technique in which the end-effector is thrown, the sample material is acquired, and the end-effector is retrieved using a light tether that acts as a \"fishing line\". The casting manipulator developed for DAVID uses an innovative sling-like technique, capable to obtain longer and more precise casts than previous oscillating versions. The analysis and experimental verification of DAVID's robot sling are reported, demonstrating its effectiveness. Finally, we give a brief account of the outcomes of the ESA Lunar Robotics Challenge, where our team came in second over other 8 teams that passed the final qualification phase.",

        "abstract": "Traditional legged runners and climbers have relied heavily on gait generators in the form of internal clocks or reference trajectories. In contrast, here we present physical experiments with a fast, dynamical, vertical wall climbing robot accompanying a stability proof for the controller that generates it without any need for an additional internal clock or reference signal. Specifically, we show that this \u201cself-exciting\u201d controller does indeed generate an \u201calmost\u201d globally asymptotically stable limit cycle: the attractor basin is as large as topologically possible and includes all the state space excluding a set with empty interior. We offer an empirical comparison of the resulting climbing behavior to that achieved by a more conventional clock-generated gait trajectory tracker. The new, self-exciting gait generator exhibits a marked improvement in vertical climbing speed, in fact setting a new benchmark in dynamic climbing by achieving a vertical speed of 1.5 body lengths per second.",

        "abstract": "To have a robot at home might be great fun: it could fetch and carry things. However it remains open how to teach the robot the places it should go to in a manner that is cheap and entertaining for the user. This paper presents an easy-to-use interface that takes the robot on a virtual leash: using the Nintendo Wii remote the user can go towards target places while pointing at the robot. Using the inbuilt infrared camera and accelerometers and a couple of LEDs on the robot, the robot will follow the user. We show how a particle filter and an interacting multiple model (IMM) Kalman can be configured such that simple hand gestures with the Wii make the robot follow the user's intention. The concept has been implemented on a mobile robot developed within the robotshome project. The robot leash interface has been tested with 12 volunteers who are interested in new technology but have never controlled a robot. The result is that most users could within a few minutes show the robot the first three places in a home environment. Given the little cost of the interface (about $ 50) the proposed robot leash is a promising human robot interface.",

        "abstract": "For decades, insects have been a valuable source of inspiration for mechanical and control designs of legged robots. Anatomical and behavioral studies of insects such as cockroaches, stick insects and locusts have inspired the development of many robots. However, their control systems had to be engineered based upon behavioral studies and control hypotheses rather than neurobiology. Recent insect neurobiological discoveries now make it possible to control the legs of robots with a network found to control the legs of stick insects. In previous work this network we have dubbed SCASM (Sensory-Coupled Action Switching Modules) was shown coordinating the joints of a robot leg and adapting its normal leg cycle to irregularities in the terrain. We also showed that the SCASM network can be implemented effectively on a simple micro-controller with little computational power. This video describes additional sensory connections that, when added to SCASM, generate elevator and searching reflexes. We also show for the first time an autonomous hexapod robot walking over irregular terrain using a SCASM network to control each of its six legs and a Cruse type network to control its gait using only on-board, simple micro-controllers.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Gas distribution modelling constitutes an ideal application area for mobile robots, which - as intelligent mobile gas sensors - offer several advantages compared to stationary sensor networks. In this paper we propose the Kernel DM+V algorithm to learn a statistical 2-d gas distribution model from a sequence of localized gas sensor measurements. The algorithm does not make strong assumptions about the sensing locations and can thus be applied on a mobile robot that is not primarily used for gas distribution monitoring, and also in the case of stationary measurements. Kernel DM+V treats distribution modelling as a density estimation problem. In contrast to most previous approaches, it models the variance in addition to the distribution mean. Estimating the predictive variance entails a significant improvement for gas distribution modelling since it allows to evaluate the model quality in terms of the data likelihood. This offers a solution to the problem of ground truth evaluation, which has always been a critical issue for gas distribution modelling. Estimating the predictive variance also provides the means to learn meta parameters and to suggest new measurement locations based on the current model. We derive the Kernel DM+V algorithm and present a method for learning the hyper-parameters. Based on real world data collected with a mobile robot we demonstrate the consistency of the obtained maps and present a quantitative comparison, in terms of the data likelihood of unseen samples, with an alternative approach that estimates the predictive variance.",

        "abstract": "Mobile robots have to detect and handle a variety of potential hazards to navigate autonomously. We present a real-time stereo vision based mapping algorithm for identifying and modeling various hazards in urban environments - we focus on inclines, drop-offs, and obstacles. In our algorithm, stereo range data is used to construct a 3D model consisting of a point cloud with a 3D grid overlaid on top. A novel plane fitting algorithm is then used to segment the 3D model into distinct potentially traversable ground regions and fit planes to the regions. The planes and segments are analyzed to identify safe and unsafe regions and the information is captured in an annotated 2D grid map called a local safety map. The safety map can be used by wheeled mobile robots for planning safe paths in their local surroundings. We evaluate our algorithm comprehensively by testing it in varied environments and comparing the results to ground truth data.",

The system uses two cameras, each associated with a specially-shaped reflective surface, to obtain stereo information on the height above ground and the distances to potential obstacles. The camera-mirror system has the advantage that it remaps the world onto a cylindrical co-ordinate system that simplifies and speeds up range computations, and defines a collision-free cylinder through which the aircraft can pass without encountering obstacles. The result is a computationally efficient approach to vision-based aircraft guidance that is particularly suited to terrain and gorge following, obstacle avoidance, and landing. The feasibility of the system is demonstrated in laboratory and field tests.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous systems situated in the real world often need to recognize, track, and reason about various types of physical objects. In order to allow reasoning at a symbolic level, one must create and continuously maintain a correlation between symbols labeling physical objects and the sensor data being collected about them, a process called anchoring. In this paper we present a stream-based hierarchical anchoring framework extending the DyKnow knowledge processing middleware. A classification hierarchy is associated with expressive conditions for hypothesizing the type and identity of an object given streams of temporally tagged sensor data. The anchoring process constructs and maintains a set of object linkage structures representing the best possible hypotheses at any time. Each hypothesis can be incrementally generalized or narrowed down as new sensor data arrives. Symbols can be associated with an object at any level of classification, permitting symbolic reasoning on different levels of abstraction. The approach has been applied to a traffic monitoring application where an unmanned aerial vehicle collects information about a small urban area in order to detect traffic violations.",

In this paper we present the implementation of two motion-planning algorithms in LDP, and analyze both their performance and ease of implementation. We present multiple variations of one planner, including a novel resource allocation algorithm. We then draw conclusions about both the utility of the motion-planning algorithms and the suitability of LDP to the problem space. Our experiments suggest that metamodule-based planning approaches have a cost in time and/or energy terms, but that the cost can be worth paying in exchange for the additional generality and separation-of-concerns offered by these techniques. The particular tradeoff for a given system will depend upon its goals and the details of the underlying modules.",

The finger model mimics a human tendon skeletal structure. The tendon forces during the pinching motion were simulated using the finger model. Simulation results show that the tendon forces closely mirror the human muscle activity. Sensory evaluation of subjective pinching effort was conducted with five subjects. The subject pinched five kinds of cylinders, from 20 [mm] to 100 [mm]. The pinching force and the surface EMGs were simultaneously measured in the experiment. Based on the human questionnaire tests, we investigated which finger postures the human feels easy to pinch a cylinder. The results show that the pattern of the EMGs measured by the experiment is very similar to that of the tendon forces calculated by the finger model simulation. This indicates that the tendon force is a useful index of the subjective pinching effort and it can be used for the quantitative evaluation instead of EMGs.",

This paper presents a cross layer multiple path approach named proxy server based multipath connection. Multiple paths are set up via a set of intermediate proxy servers using IP tunneling. Packet distribution and reassembly are achieved by inserting a thin layer between the network layer and the transport layer. On the sender side, packets are distributed across multiple paths based on predefined striping schemes. On the receiver side, a double buffer approach is proposed to solve the TCP sequence number persistent reordering problem. A prototype was implemented on the Linux and Windows systems. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can improve network throughput and is robust to network congestion and link breakage.",

Particularly, most bilateral control frameworks fail to address position coordination when interacting with rigid environments. In this paper we present a novel control strategy that aims to passively compensate for position errors that arise during contact tasks and, in general, achieve stability and transparency when alternating between unobstructed (free) and obstructed (contact) environments. The proposed control framework exploits the wave impedance independent passivity property of the scattering transformation to guarantee stability and transparency by gradually switching between a low wave impedance, ideal for free motion, and a sufficiently large impedance, suitable for contact tasks. The validity of the control framework is verified through simulations and experiments on a pair of nonlinear robots.",

        "abstract": "Many applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) require the capability to navigate to some goal and to perform precise and safe landing. In this paper, we present a visual navigation system as an alternative pose estimation method for environments and situations in which GPS is unavailable. The developed visual odometer is an incremental procedure that estimates the vehicle's ego-motion by extracting and tracking visual features, using an onboard camera. For more robustness and accuracy, the visual estimates are fused with measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a Pressure Sensor Altimeter (PSA) in order to provide accurate estimates of the vehicle's height, velocity and position relative to a given location. These estimates are then exploited by a nonlinear hierarchical controller for achieving various navigation tasks such as take-off, landing, hovering, target tracking, etc. In addition to the odometer description, the paper presents validation results from autonomous flights using a small quadrotor UAV.",

The proposed method consists of feedforward control and feedback control for walking pattern generation. The pole placement method as a feedback controller changes the poles of system in order to generate more stable and smoother walking pattern. The advanced pole-zero cancellation by series approximation (PZCSA) as a feedforward controller plays a role of reducing the inherent property of linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM), that is, non-minimum phase property due to an unstable zero of LIPM and tracking efficiently the desired zero moment point (ZMP). The efficiency of the proposed method is verified by three simulations such as arbitrary walking step length, arbitrary walking phase time and sudden change of walking path.",

The video also shows AWE beginning to behave intelligently as well as users fine-tuning AWE's configurations by gesturing proximity sensors mounted at the hinges between wall panels.

        "abstract": "The wheels of planetary rovers that are used in space explorations sometimes slip or lose contact with the ground while traversing a sandy terrain. In order to estimate the behavior of these rovers moving on loose soil, it is very important to accurately estimate the drawbar pull of their wheels. Some wheel-soil interaction models based on terramechanics have been proposed for the estimation of the normal stress distribution and drawbar pull of such rovers. However, our experimental results (normal stress distributions are directly measured using a pressure sensor array, which is attached to the wheels of a rover) show that the distribution range of normal stress for small wheeled rovers obtained using the proposed method is considerably smaller than that obtained by using conventional method. Consequently, the drawbar pull estimated using conventional methods is inaccurate. Therefore, in this study, the normal stress distribution is directly measured using pressure sensors in order to estimate drawbar pull accurately. From the data obtained using the sensors, a soil parameter, which is generally very difficult to measure, is estimated. Then, the drawbar pull is estimated using this parameter. The drawbar pull estimated by using the proposed method is more accurate than that estimated using conventional methods. In this study, we propose a new method for the estimation of drawbar pull and also validate this method.",

        "abstract": "The problem of accurate 6-DoF pose estimation of 3D objects based on their shape has so far been solved only for specific object geometries. Edge-based recognition and tracking methods rely on the extraction of straight line segments or other primitives. Straight-forward extensions of 2D approaches are potentially more general, but assume a limited range of possible view angles. The general problem is that a 3D object can potentially produce completely different 2D projections depending on the view angle. One way to tackle this problem is to use canonical views. However, accurate shape-based 6-DoF pose estimation requires more information than matching of canonical views can provide. In this paper, we present a novel approach to 6-DoF pose estimation of single-colored objects based on their shape. Our approach combines stereo triangulation with matching against a high-resolution view set of the object, each view having associated orientation information. The errors that arise from separating the position and orientation computation in first place are corrected by a subsequent correction procedure based on online 3D model projection. The proposed approach can estimate the pose of a single object within 20 ms using conventional hardware.",

The gripper is constructed from protrudent tips of two independently actuated atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilevers and each cantilever. A protocol allows these two cantilevers to form a gripper for grasping and releasing the microspheres to target positions without obstacle of adhesive forces in air. For grasping, amplitude feedback from the dithering cantilevers is employed to locate the grasping points by laterally scanning the side of the microspheres. Real time force sensing is used to monitor the whole process of the pick-and-place with steps of pickup, transport and release. For trajectory planning, an algorithm based on the shortest path solution is used to obtained 3-D micropatterns with high efficiencies. In experiments, microspheres with diameters from 3 \u00bfm to 4 \u00bfm were manipulated and 3-D micropyramids with two layers were achieved. 3-D micromanipulation and 3-D microassembly at the scale of several microns to submicron could become feasible through the newly developed nanotip gripper.",

        "abstract": "Although there have been much research on robot walking, the energy efficiency of central pattern generator (CPG)-based walking has not received much attention. This study proposes a novel method for acquiring energy-efficient CPG-based bipedal walking for a robot with knees and feet. In this method, we introduce a torque-free period for swing leg control into the swing leg control cycle. During this period, no torque is applied to the hip joint controller, and therefore no energy is consumed. When and for how long the torque-free period is inserted into the swing leg control cycle is adaptively acquired by reinforcement learning. Simulation experiments demonstrate the feasibility of our method. The energy consumed in acquiring walking is reduced by 40% compared with simple CPG-based walking without the torque-free period in the practical learning speed. Walking stability is maintained with respect to external disturbances on a level floor. Although the method is more unstable on slopes with the torque-free period, the torque-free-period can be adaptively eliminated to achieve stable walking on the slopes.",

        "abstract": "In mobile manipulation, the position to which the robot navigates has a large influence on the ease with which a subsequent manipulation action can be performed. Whether a manipulation action succeeds depends on many factors, such as the robot's hardware configuration, the controllers the robot uses to achieve navigation and manipulation, the task context, and uncertainties in state estimation. In this paper, we present \u2018ARPLACE\u2019, an action-related place which takes these factors, and the context in which the actions are performed into account. Through experience-based learning, the robot first learns a so-called generalized success model, which discerns between positions from which manipulation succeeds or fails. On-line, this model is used to compute a ARPLACE, a probability distribution that maps positions to a predicted probability of successful manipulation, and takes the uncertainty in the robot and object's position into account. In an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that using ARPLACEs for least-commitment navigation improves the success rate of subsequent manipulation tasks substantially.",

        "abstract": "For a complex autonomous robotic system such as a humanoid robot, motor-babbling-based sensorimotor learning is considered an effective method to develop an internal model of the self-body and the environment autonomously. However, learning process requires much time for exploration and computation. In this paper, we propose a method of sensorimotor learning which explores the learning domain actively. Our approach discovers that the embodied learning system can design its own learning process actively, which is different from the conventional passive data-access machine learning. The proposed model is characterized by a function we call the \u201cconfidence\u201d, and is a measure of the reliability of state control. The confidence for the state can be a good measure to bias the exploration strategy of data sampling, and to direct its attention to areas of learning interest. We consider the confidence function to be a first step toward an active behavior design for autonomous environment adaptation. The approach was experimentally validated in typical sensorimotor coordination such as arm reaching and object fixation, using the humanoid robot James and the iCub simulator.",

        "abstract": "When children learn to grasp a new object, they often know several possible grasping points from observing a parent's demonstration and subsequently learn better grasps by trial and error. From a machine learning point of view, this process is an active learning approach. In this paper, we present a new robot learning framework for reproducing this ability in robot grasping. For doing so, we chose a straightforward approach: first, the robot observes a few good grasps by demonstration and learns a value function for these grasps using Gaussian process regression. Subsequently, it chooses grasps which are optimal with respect to this value function using a mean-shift optimization approach, and tries them out on the real system. Upon every completed trial, the value function is updated, and in the following trials it is more likely to choose even better grasping points. This method exhibits fast learning due to the data-efficiency of the Gaussian process regression framework and the fact that the mean-shift method provides maxima of this cost function. Experiments were repeatedly carried out successfully on a real robot system. After less than sixty trials, our system has adapted its grasping policy to consistently exhibit successful grasps.",

They need the capability of segmenting objects in their visual field. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to segmentation based on the operation of fixation by an active observer. Our approach is different from current approaches: while existing works attempt to segment the whole scene at once into many areas, we segment only one image region, specifically the one containing the fixation point. Furthermore, our solution integrates monocular cues (color, texture) with binocular cues (stereo disparities and optical flow). Experiments with real imagery collected by our active robot and from the known databases [1] demonstrate the promise of the approach.",

With a lateral motion of the MMT in microchannels, the continuous phase can be pinched off by the movement of MMT to obtain size-controlled droplets actively. With this method, particle-enclosed droplet can be produced on demand to fit the size of each enclosed particle, and which is difficult to carry out only by the fluid dynamic force. For the current study, the system has been evaluated in terms of the frequency of the actuation of MMT and the size of the produced droplets, and found out the response time to change the droplet size by MMT actuation is one third of that only by the fluid dynamic force. This system contributes to the effective transportation of cells in microchannel.",

In adaptive control design for the space robot, because of high dynamical coupling between an actively operated arm and a passively moving end-point, two inherent difficulties exist, such as non-linear parameterization of the dynamic equation and both kinematic and dynamic parameter uncertainties in the coordinate mapping from Cartesian space to joint space. The proposed method in this study overcomes the above two issues by paying attention to the coupling dynamics. The proposed adaptive controller does not involve any measurement of acceleration; but it is still possible for the system to be linearly parameterized in terms of uncertain parameters and a suitable input torque can be generated in the presence of model uncertainty. A numerical simulation was carried out to confirm the validity of the proposed adaptive control.",

A highly compliant spring in the knee joint allows the exploitation of periodic energy storage but creates a major control challenge by severely limiting the bandwidth of closed-loop position or force control. This handicap is intensified by slow actuators, substantial delays, and the kinematic coupling of the articulated design. With classic closed-loop control strategies failing, an adaptive open-loop control algorithm is presented, that, over a series of jumps, estimates the compression of the actuator springs, and gradually modifies the motor inputs in order to minimize slipping and create a purely vertical motion.",

Many studies focussing division of labor control inspired biological phenomenon have been reported. However, the optimality is not discussed because decentralized control is typically complicated. In this study, we propose the division of labor control method for robot group that enable adaptively select whether homogeneous state or heterogeneous state against working conditions and address the optimality by mathematical analysis. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the computer simulations are carried out and we confirm that robot group implemented the proposed method inevitably organize the division of labor state with group performance improvement.",

However, there are some existing problems in this control method, such as network fragmentation, loss of formation and poor tracking performance. In order to handle these problems we propose a novel approach to flocking control of a mobile sensor network to track a moving target within changing environments. In our approach, each agent can cooperatively learn the network's parameters to decide the size of network in a decentralized fashion so that the connectivity, formation and tracking performance can be improved when avoiding obstacles. In addition, to demonstrate the benefit of our approach a comparison between this approach and the existing method is given. Computer simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

A decentralized control inspired from the adaptive immune system TH1/TH2 differentiation mechanism has been proposed. The resulting patrol control exhibits robustness under adversarial conditions. This is primarily because the motion period can be arbitrary, which makes it difficult for intruders to find weak spots for attack. Moreover, this immuno-inspired control can avoid collision and automatically recover from agent failure.",

The location of the docking station has a considerable effect on task performance. In nonstationary tasks the optimal dock location may vary over the length of the task. In multiple-robot systems, spatial interference between charging and working robots can make it difficult to find an optimal dock location, even in static tasks. We propose a new approach whereby the dock is itself an autonomous robot that attempts to incrementally improve its location. We show simulation results from a simple local controller that adapts to nonstationary tasks and spatial interference, and thus improves overall task performance compared to a static dock.",

The proposed method substitutes the random sampling in the learning phase of the PRM planner and improves the configuration of the roadmap. This method uses two phase to determine nodes in order to construct the roadmap. First, the proposed method extracts initial nodes using the approximated cell decomposition and the Harris corner detector. Second, the positions of these nodes are optimized using a construction process of the centroidal voronoi tessellation (CVT). The proposed method determines the adequate number and positions of the nodes to represent the entire free space, and the PRM planner based on the proposed method finds out efficient paths even in narrow passages. These properties have been verified though experiments.",

        "abstract": "In the face of large scale parametric uncertainties, the single model (SM)-based classical adaptive control approach demands high observer, controller and adaptation gains in order to achieve good tracking performance. The well known problem of having high-gain based design is that it amplifies the input and output disturbance as well as excites hidden unmodeled dynamics causing poor tracking performance. In this paper, a multi-model based adaptive design is proposed to reduce the level of parametric uncertainty in order to reduce the observer-controller gains. The key idea of this approach is to allow the parameter estimate of the SM-based classical adaptive control design to be reset into a model that best approximates the plant among a finite set of candidate models. For this purpose, we uniformly distribute the compact set of unknown parameters into a finite number of smaller compact subsets. Then we design a family of candidate controllers for each of these smaller compact subsets. The derivative of the Lyapunov function candidate is used as a resetting criterion to identify a candidate model that closely approximates the plant at each instant of time. The proposed method is evaluated on a 2-DOF robot manipulator to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical development.",

        "abstract": "We present an efficient approach to generating paths for a robotic manipulator that are collision-free and guaranteed to meet task specifications despite pose uncertainty. We first describe how to use task space regions (TSRs) to specify grasping and object placement tasks for a manipulator. We then show how to modify a set of TSRs for a certain task to take into account pose uncertainty. A key advantage of this approach is that if the pose uncertainty is too great to accomplish a certain task, we can quickly reject that task without invoking a planner. If the task is not rejected we run the IKBiRRT planner, which trades-off exploring the robot's C-space with sampling from TSRs to compute a path. Finally, we show several examples of a 7-DOF WAM arm planning paths in a cluttered kitchen environment where the poses of all objects are uncertain.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Typical multi-robot systems consist of robots cooperating to maximize global fitness functions. However, in some scenarios, the set of interacting robots may not share common goals and thus the concept of a global fitness function becomes invalid. This work examines multi-robot communities (MRC), in which individual robots have independent goals. Within the MRC context, we present a task allocation architecture that optimizes individual robot fitness functions over long time horizons using reciprocal altruism. Previous work has shown that reciprocating altruistic relationships can evolve between two willing robots, using market-based task auctions, while still protecting against selfish robots aiming to exploit altruism. As these relationships grow, robots are increasingly likely to perform tasks for one another without any reward or promise of payback. This work furthers this notion by considering cases where an imbalance exists in the altruistic relationship. The imbalance occurs when one robot can perform another robot's task, thereby exhibiting altruism, but the other robot cannot reciprocate since it is physically unable (e.g. lack of adequate sensors or actuators). A new altruistic controller to deal with such imbalances is presented. The controller permits a robot to build altruistic relationships with the community as a whole (one-to-many), instead of just with single robots (one-to-one). The controller is proven stable and guarantees altruistic relationships will grow, if robots are willing, while still minimizing the effects of selfish robots. Results indicate that the one-to-many controller performs comparable to the one-to-one on most problems, but excels in the case of an unbalanced altruistic relationship.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Advanced sonar systems produce both accurate range and bearing measurements rather than just range alone as in conventional systems. Previous advanced sonar rings do not process incoming echo data as it arrives, but only after a completed measurement cycle and only on limited data samples that are above a noise floor threshold. The system described in this paper can process all echo data, as it is produced, with full matched filtering tuned to each receiver on all echo samples directly implemented in hardware. This minimises measurement latency, important for real time robotics applications and also provides optimal arrival time estimates due to the matched filters. Previous systems have used sequential firing of many transmitters around the ring to prevent interference between transmitters or used different pulses fired simultaneously. This paper presents a single transmitter solution where a reflector disperses a single ultrasonic pulse evenly around the sonar ring. Processing is performed with a dedicated hardware data processing architecture implemented with a Field Programmable Gate Array to achieve the desired real time performance. The system reports range and bearing results at a rate of 30 measurement cycles a second in a full 360 degree coverage to ranges up to 4 metres with the prototype processing over 4.9 Giga-arithmetic operations per second. Experimental results are presented that show the performance of the system is suitable for high speed mapping and localisation applications.",

        "abstract": "To develop a gait rehabilitation robot for hemiplegic patients, quantitative evaluations of patient ability is needed. Patient's walk phase, which includes time balance of stance and swing legs, is one of the most useful indexes. However, conventional methods measuring walk phase require laborious preparations. In this paper, a novel algorithm estimating walk phase on a treadmill by observing DC motor current is proposed. In comparison of this algorithm and conventional methods, it was verified that the proposed algorithm had as the same accuracy as foot switch. Moreover, the proposed algorithm could estimate stance phase in 0.2 (s) errors between measurements of force plate mostly (4 out of 5 healthy subjects). However, result from the 5th subject showed that the proposed algorithm had erroneously identified stance phase as swing phase when little body weight loaded on leg. This characteristic is often observed in hemiplegic gait. Therefore, the proposed algorithm might need improvement of motor current threshold. However, this algorithm had capable of estimating the time of loading body weight on leg, and thus could be useful as a quantitative evaluation tool.",

As various complications can result in facial disfigurement and loss of functionality in facial muscles it is required to develop a supporting device for people with such conditions. The previously proposed robot mask, which consists of a head supporter and motor units attempts to recreate facial expressions artificially by pulling the facial skin through cables attached to the skin. Since a facial expression is the result of the full or partial activation of combination of facial muscles, it is necessary to control the amount of displacement of the artificially created skin movement. Furthermore, in order to facilitate interpersonal timing of facial expressions, it is necessary to be able to read the nerve signals and process them in real time. This paper presents a compact and fully controllable actuation unit for the earlier proposed robot mask, and analyzes the relationship between the displacement of the specifically selected areas of the face and the actuation by control unit. It also present a bioelectrical signal based real time signal processing system to determine the requirement for an artificial expression.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper describes an industrial robot joint offset calibration method called the virtual line-based single-point constraint approach. Previous methods such as using CMM, laser trackers or cameras are limited by the cost or the resolution. The proposed method relies mainly upon a laser pointer attached on the end-effector and single position-sensitive detector (PSD) arbitrarily located on the workcell. The automated calibration procedure (about three minutes) involves aiming the laser lines loaded by the robot towards the center of the PSD surface from various robot positions and orientations. The intersections of each pair of laser lines eventually should converge to the same point after compensating the joint offsets. An optimization model and algorithm have been formulated to identify the robot offset. For the highly precise feedback, a segmented PSD with a position resolution of better than 0.1 \u00bfm is employed. The mean accuracy of robot localization is up to 0.02 mm, and the mean error of the parameter identification is less than 0.08 degrees. Both simulations and experiments implemented on an ABB industrial robot verify the feasibility of the proposed method and demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed calibration system. The goal of fast, automated, low-cost, and high precision offset calibration are achieved.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose an approach to SLAM suitable for bathymetric mapping by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). AUVs typically do not have access to GPS while underway and the survey areas of interest are unlikely to contain features that can easily be identified and tracked using bathymetric sonar. We demonstrate how the uncertainty in the vehicle state can be modeled using a particle filter and an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), where each particle maintains a 2D depth map to model the seafloor. Efficient methods for maintaining and resampling the joint maps and particles using Distributed Particle Mapping are then described. Our algorithm was tested using field data collected by an AUV equipped with multibeam sonar. The results achieved by Bathymetric distributed Particle SLAM (BPSLAM) demonstrate how observations of the seafloor structure improve the estimated trajectory and resulting map when compared to dead reckoning fused with USBL observations, the best navigation solution during the trials. Furthermore, the computational run time to deliver these results falls well below the total mission time, providing the potential for the algorithm to be implemented in real time.",

        "abstract": "The problem of mobile robot self-localization is considered as solved since Thrun's et. al [1] pioneering work using monte-carlo filters for robot Localization (MCL). However, MCL is robust and precise under constraints like completely known environments and the sensor data must contain enough \u201ctrue data\u201d as contained in the map. In fact these conditions cannot always be guaranteed, which may results in a poor accuracy of the localization. In this paper we present a area-based observation model that is applied to MCL self-localization. The model is based on the idea of tracking the ground area inside the \u201cfree space\u201d (not occupied cells) of a known map. Experimental data shows that the proposed model improves the robustness and accuracy of laser and stereo vision sensors under certain conditions like incomplete map, limited FOV and limited range of sensing. We also present an efficient approximation of our sensor model based on integral images.",

The proposed algorithm is derived from a nonlinear least-squares formulation, and provides an optimal position estimate from a number (greater than or equal to the dimension of the environment) of reference points and corresponding distance measurements. Using standard linear algebra techniques, the proposed algorithm has low computational complexity and high operational robustness. Error analysis has been conducted through simulations on representative examples. The results show that the proposed algorithm has lower systematic error and uncertainty in position estimation when dealing with erroneous inputs, compared with representative closed-form methods.",

The AUKF is designed to deal with problems which occur on other planets: wheel slip, visual odometry error, and gyro drift. To solve the problems, the AUKF estimates the slippage ratio in an augmented state vector, the accuracy of the visual odometry with the number of inliers among feature points, and sensor usefulness with gyrodometry model. Experimental results of rover runs over rough terrain are presented, the effectiveness of the AUKF and its each component is shown.",

Analysis of a snake's propulsion based on a continuum model unveils that the lateral undulation can be achieved by bending the body at torque proportional to the curvature derivative of the body curve, as observed in muscular activities of biological snakes. Thanks to the simplicity of this principle, a pure mechanical structure comprising a fluid servomechanism can be realized. The proposed propulsion mechanism also consists of gears that propagate the joint angle information to the posterior joint to mechanically simulate curvature derivative.",

The panoramic perception solution permits us to address efficiently the problem of close vehicles detection but also the monitoring side traffic system. The fusion and integration of this sensorial data stream is assumed by a credibilist architecture based on the transferable belief model (TBM) of SMETS. This paradigm permits the filtering of false alarms efficiently by an optimal management of the uncertainties estimation.",

        "abstract": "In order to eliminate the drawbacks of conventional force feedback gloves, a new type of master hand has been developed. By utilizing three \u00bffour-bar mechanism joint\u00bf in series and wire coupling mechanism, the master finger transmission ratio is kept exact 1:1.4:1 in the whole movement range and it can make active motions in both extension and flexion direction. Additionally, to assure faster data transmission and near zero delay in master-slave operation, a digital signal processing/field programmable gate array (DSP/FPGA-FPGA) structure with 200 \u00bfs cycle time is designed. The operating modes of the master hand can be contact or non-contact, which depends on the motion states of slave hand, free motion or constrained motion. The position control employed in non-contact mode ensures unconstrained motion and the force control adopted in contact mode guarantees natural contact sensation. To evaluate the performances of the master hand, an master-slave control experiment based on force-position control method between the master hand and DLR/HIT hand is conducted. The results demonstrate this new type master hand can augment telepresence.",

In particular, we show how to improve the algorithm's performance also when matching point clouds produced by stereo cameras, given that this kind of input invalidates some of the assumptions we formerly identified in order to accelerate HSM3D's performance. We also show that by incorporating color information into the the algorithm it is possible to reduce the number of sporadic outliers in the solution set, thus providing a more reliable algorithm.",

        "abstract": "The latency model is an analytical model for describing the behavior of nonlinear viscoelastic contact interface in robotic grasping and manipulation. The latency model is based on experimental observation of viscoelastic materials which exhibit the behavior of both elastic and temporal responses when subject to external force or displacement. It is postulated that such materials display latency in response of external influence by the rearrangement of molecules, holes, and structures in order to achieve an equilibrium state corresponding to the instantaneous loading. As a result, we propose that there are temporal latent activities in progress before the material reaches the equilibrium state. In the previous study [21], the latent activity of strain re-distribution with a prescribed constant displacement was presented using both theoretical modeling and experimental results. In this paper, we build upon this latency model to study the behavior of viscoelastic materials under different loading rates with experimental results. The latency model is employed to explain the behavior of responses of hard and soft viscoelastic materials typically found in robotic contact and grasping.",

This controller can yield asymptotic stability of the helicopter in horizontal motion control, which can be proven by the linear stability analysis. And this controller can flawlessly engage with traditional dual loop autopilot by using auto-varying references in an inner stabilizing loop. Moreover, to facilitate the controller design, this paper derives the dynamics of hingeless helicopters with an emphasis on gyroscopic effect. Finally, the stability and superior performance of the proposed controller are empirically demonstrated on an instrumented JR Voyager GSR helicopter.",

The method is based on the incremental generation of a configuration-space data structure called Sensor-based Exploration Tree (SET). The expansion of the SET is driven by information at the world level, where the perception process takes place. In particular, the frontiers of the explored region efficiently guide the search for informative view configurations. Different exploration strategies may be obtained by instantiating the general SET method with different sampling techniques. Two such strategies are presented and compared by simulations in non-trivial 2D and 3D worlds. A completeness analysis of SET is given in the paper.",

In this paper, we propose a novel CPG model that is based on altering a nonlinear oscillator to obtain desired limit cycle behavior. This CPG model benefits from an explicit basin of attraction and also fast convergence behavior. The presented CPG model is used in an imitation model that tries to learn the proper periodical behavior by looking at a mentor. First, a mentor performs the desired periodical behavior. Then, a hand-eye coordination process, inspired from infant babbling, is initiated to extract proper motor actions from what is observed. The extracted motor actions are finally embedded into the CPG model for smooth reproduction. This imitation model is implemented on a robotic marionette behavior learning task. The outcome of the final performance of the robotic marionette is behaviorally understandable smooth actions.",

The classic approach of hand-coded controllers is very efficient for well-defined tasks and specific environments but poor in adapting to changing environmental conditions. One alternative approach is the application of evolutionary algorithms which need, in turn, easily evolvable representations of controllers. In this paper, we investigate one promising approach of an artificial hormone system as a control paradigm which is believed to be easily optimized by evolutionary processes. In a first step of this research, we focus on the simple task of collision avoidance. We present a brief mathematical analysis of this controller approach and an implementation of the controller on a mobile robot to check the feasibility in principle of our approach. The task is successfully accomplished and we conclude with a discussion of the hormone dynamics in the robot.",

The proposed modular mechanism is connected sequentially by series units of underactuated mechanisms, which have the feature of passive self-adaptive in grasp operation and uniformizable in design procedure. The design considerations for modular underactuated mechanism are outlined. Optimality criteria are analyzed with the aim to formulate a general design algorithm. An example of a four-phalanx modular robotic finger is studied as an improvement of new version LARM Hand with the aim to show the practical feasibility for the proposed modular concepts and design methods.",

        "abstract": "The paper develops a method for analyzing and improving by control obstacle clearance capacities of articulated multi-wheeled rovers. On uneven ground surface, load and traction force distributions through the wheel/ground contact system are highly coupled. They are both conditioned by the global equilibrium of the mechanical system and the contact stability constraints. The optimal traction force distribution problem is formulated here as a convex optimization problem using Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). Velocity and force transmissions in articulated multi-wheeled mobile robots are introduced under a generic form decomposed in task, joint and contact levels. A tyre-model is used for the evaluation of the robustness of the solution with respect to slippage phenomena. Simulation results show that the traction distribution forces which is so determined lead to a significant increase in obstacle clearance capacities compared to an usual velocity control technique.",

The analysis of recorded data from human operation reveals that the driver does not use the full potential of the machine due to the complexity of the manipulation task. We suggest an optimization procedure that takes advantage of the kinematic redundancy so that time-efficient joint and velocity profiles along the path can be obtained. Differential constraints imposed by the manipulator dynamics are accounted for by employing a phase-plane technique for admissible path timings. Velocity constraints of the individual joints are particularly restrictive in hydraulic manipulators. Our study aims for semi-autonomous schemes that can provide assistance to the operator for executing global motions.",

By transforming the stiffness of individual flexure elements and rigid links comprising a compliant mechanism into a global coordinate system, we enable the formulation of an equivalent mechanism stiffness. Using that stiffness in concert with an energy-based performance metric, we predict the performance of a compliant mechanism subjected to a prescribed set of forces in the global coordinate system. We analyze a flexure-based Sarrus linkage and use the performance metric to improve the design by adding topological redundancy. Finally, our approach is experimentally validated by constructing and testing SCM Sarrus linkages in a variety of geometries and topologies and demonstrating agreement between the model and our experiments.",

This type of locomotion is interesting for robotics to design robots capable of locomotion on water and land. In this work we identify the control and structural parameters that contribute to forward terrestrial locomotion. We introduce a kinematic model of Salamandra robotica II, a new salamander robot, to explore how the stride length varies with different limb sizes and different types of body oscillations. We also perform systematic tests using a dynamic model built in a physics-based simulator to analyze the locomotion performance in terms of forward speed and power consumption. The results show that it is beneficial to use body undulations with variable curvature along the body, and that the tail can serve as a fifth limb to provide thrust on ground. Experiments using the real robot validate the simulation results and the contribution of the proposed control strategies.",

In this paper, we propose the use of soft actuation materials as active joints for propelling biomimetic robotic fish. An analytical model is developed to compute the thrust force generated by a two-link tail and the resulting moments in the active joints. The computed joint moments can be combined with internal dynamics of actuation materials to provide realistic kinematic constraints for the joints. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling is also adopted to examine the flow field, the produced thrust, and the bending moments in joints for the two-link tail. Good agreement is achieved between the analytical modeling and the CFD modeling, which points to a promising two-tier framework for the understanding and optimization of robotic fish with a multi-link tail. We also show that, comparing to a one-link bending tail, a two-link tail is able to produce much higher thrust and more versatile maneuvers, such as backward swimming.",

One interesting result of this investigation is that frictional forces are skillfully controlled by the carrier. In the first experiment, we study a \"knack\" that allows the carrier to reposition the rider. In the second experiment we verify the effectiveness of the knack in achieving the repositioning result. We also studied the principle of the repositioning motion, and found that it is similar in many ways to a jumping motion. Then we confirmed the validity of our modeling assumptions using a dynamical simulator.",

As a result, researchers are increasingly implementing compliance within actuation systems using a variety of mechanisms. In general, these actuators can be grouped in 2 main categories. The first category includes all the actuation systems with a compliant element connected in series (SEA), while the second group contains all those systems that employ two actuators placed antagonistically. In both designs the ability to regulate the stiffness is essential in order to meet safety and/or performance demands. Energy consumption is a very important aspect to be considered, especially in autonomous robots. This paper presents a theoretical study on the energy consumption of variable stiffness actuators, comparing the amount of energy required in order to perform a certain task.",

        "abstract": "We describe a framework for finding and tracking \u00bftrails\u00bf for autonomous outdoor robot navigation. Through a combination of visual cues and ladar-derived structural information, the algorithm is able to follow paths which pass through multiple zones of terrain smoothness, border vegetation, tread material, and illumination conditions. Our shape-based visual trail tracker assumes that the approaching trail region is approximately triangular under perspective. It generates region hypotheses from a learned distribution of expected trail width and curvature variation, and scores them using a robust measure of color and brightness contrast with flanking regions. The structural component analogously rewards hypotheses which correspond to empty or low-density regions in a groundstrike-filtered ladar obstacle map. Our system's performance is analyzed on several long sequences with diverse appearance and structural characteristics. Ground-truth segmentations are used to quantify performance where available, and several alternative algorithms are compared on the same data.",

In PID control technique, however, there are limits to the accuracy of the resulting movement because of the influence of gravity, friction, and interaction of joints caused by modeling errors. Digital acceleration control has robustness for the modeling errors. But it requires position, velocity, and acceleration of a controlled object to construct a controller. In this paper, we use the novel digital differentiator, ESDS. It enables digital acceleration control without increasing the number of sensors. Furthermore, the proposed method works effectively for quantized sensor data. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed by simulations and experiments using 2-link manipulator.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an assemblable hand that can be inserted through trocars for robotic hand assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS). When it is difficult to perform surgery using only slender laparoscopic surgery instruments, surgeons often apply HALS, which makes an incision about 7-8 cm through which their hand is inserted. This is invasive compared with complete laparoscopic surgery. We proposed robotic HALS to replace a human hand with a robotic hand. We previously developed a three-fingered five-degree of freedom assemblable hand. It is challenging to an assemblable hand with more degrees of freedom (DOF) that can be assembled with a simple assembly procedure. This paper presents an assemblable hand with three fingers and nine degrees of freedom-the 3f9d-hand. Its power transmission mechanisms and assembly procedure are completely different from those of our previous 3f5d-hand. The new hand consists of center, right, and left finger units. The center finger unit connects the operational part at its end and the right and left finger units connect to the operational part outside the abdominal cavity. This facilitates assembly and improves safety, which is a significant improvement compared with the previous hand. Although the hand has no wrist joint, its three finger joints play the role of a wrist joint. A preliminary experiment with a plastic model verified that the proposed assembly procedure was feasible and the hand was easily asembled and disassembled.",

        "abstract": "Since humanoid robots have similar body structures to humans, a humanoid robot is expected to perform various dynamic tasks including object manipulation. This research focuses on issues related to learning and performing object manipulation. Basic motion primitives for tasks are learned from observation of human's behaviors. An object manipulation task is divided into two types of motion primitives, which are represented as hidden Markov models (HMMs): one for a body motion primitive and the other for the relation between the object and body parts, which manipulate the object. When performing a task, a natural whole body motion is associated from an object motion by using learned motion primitives. Furthermore, the associated body motion is reshaped in both spatial and temporal space, in a more precise way. The reshaping in spatial space is realized in two stages by a feedback control policy learned with reinforcement learning and by constrained inverse kinematics. Key features like end-effectors for manipulation and timing for a task are extracted and used for the feedback control policy learning. The reshaping in temporal space is realized by comparing a predicted and observed object motion speed.",

Previous work has focused on the use of a large primary power actuator to generate flapping motion and smaller \u00bfcontrol\u00bf actuators to asymmetrically alter wing kinematics. Here a new iteration of this concept is presented, merging the two actuator types to create a \u00bfhybrid\u00bf power-control actuator. Kinematic and dynamic models for wing motion are presented, and the predictions of these models are compared to experimental results from a prototype design. Controllable asymmetry in wing kinematics can be mapped into controllable body torques via an aerodynamic model, and this information can be used for the generation of control laws for stable hover and eventually highly agile aerial vehicles.",

        "abstract": "In order to understand and characterize the mechanical property and response of the mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC), we used an atomic force microscope (AFM) combined with a PHANToM haptic feedback device. Atomic force microscopy has rapidly become a valuable tool for quantifying the biophysical properties of single cells or a collection of cells through force measurements. We report herein the mechanical characterization of single mESC using indentation-relaxation measurements with micro-sphere AFM probes for fixed and live undifferentiated mESC. During cell indentation for both live and fixed undifferentiated cells, we provided force feedback to the user in real-time through the PHANToM haptic feedback device as the AFM tip was deforming the cell. The force was amplified for the human operator to perceive the change in force during cell indentation by the AFM cantilever. This information can be used as a mechanical marker to characterize state of the cell (live and fixed). As the interpretation of atomic force microscopy-based indentation tests is highly dependent on the use of an appropriate theoretical model of the testing configuration, various contact models are presented to predict the mechanical behavior of an individual mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) in different states. A comparison study with finite element simulations (FEM) of spherical tip indentation demonstrates the effectiveness of our computational model to predict the mESC deformation during indentation and relaxation nanomanipulation tasks.",

GPS devices are notorious for their measurement errors vary from one point to the next. Therefore in order to improve the quality of the attitude estimates, the covariance matrix of measurement noise is estimated in real time upon information obtained from the differential GPS measurements, so that the KF filter continually is \u00bftuned\u00bf as well as possible. No a priori knowledge on the direction cosines of the gravity vector in the inertial frame is required as these parameters can be also identified by the KF, relieving any need for calibration. Next, taking advantage of the redundant GPS measurements, a weight least-squares estimator is derived to weight the GPS measurement with the \u00bfgood\u00bf data more heavily than the one with \u00bfpoor\u00bf data in the estimation process leading to a robust position estimation. Test results are presented showing the performance of the integrated IMU and two GPS to estimate the attitude and location of a mobile robot moving across uneven terrain.",

        "abstract": "In mobile robotics applications, pattern and object recognition are mainly achieved relying only on vision. Several other perceptual modalities are also available such as, touch, hearing or vestibular proprioception. They are rarely used and can provide valuable additional information within the recognition tasks. This article presents an analysis of several methods of fusion of perceptual and auditory modalitites. It relies on the use of a perspective camera and a microphone on a moving object recognition problem. Experimental data are also provided on a database of audio/visual objects including cases of visual occlusions and audio corruptions.",

        "abstract": "A two-fingered micro hand has been available for use for years and allows dexterous manipulation of a single cell: grabbing, positioning, rotating and releasing. The end-effector of this micro hand consists of two glass needles; however, the glass tips must be finely adjusted and the micro hand must be calibrated prior to use. Because these initial procedures require highly skilled human operators and a great deal of time, a fine adjustment module (FAM) has been developed for assisting with the fine adjustment work and was successfully shown to make the initial setup easier. However, problems with the calibration process and with the dependence on a user of the FAM control are still present. One means of improving the system for users is to automate the initial setup. The detection of the glass tips in a wide range of Z directions from a microscopic image having a small depth of focus requires robust calibration and must be possible using an automated FAM control. From this perspective, the tip position detection algorithm using the evaluation function, Image Quality Measurement (IQM), is proposed in this paper. Based on this algorithm, the automated initial setup method is explained and its effectiveness is experimentally evaluated.",

Much research has focused on various \u00bfblack box\u00bf approaches, in which the synthesized or learned control algorithms perform well when tested, but are difficult or impossible to analyze and understand. This paper presents the use of the ADATE system to evolve a control algorithm based on a racing car simulator. The system evolved compact and analyzable yet sophisticated control algorithms capable of driving millions of randomly generated tracks at high speeds without ever driving off the road. The approach presented is likely to be applicable to most automatic control problems, given a set of training examples and a suitable software simulator.",

        "abstract": "Previous work [1] shows that the movement representation in task spaces offers many advantages for learning object-related and goal-directed movement tasks through imitation. It allows to reduce the dimensionality of the data that is learned and simplifies the correspondence problem that results from different kinematic structures of teacher and robot. Further, the task space representation provides a first generalization, for example wrt. differing absolute positions, if bi-manual movements are represented in relation to each other. Although task spaces are widely used, even if they are not mentioned explicitly, they are mostly defined a priori. This work is a step towards an automatic selection of task spaces. Observed movements are mapped into a pool of possibly even conflicting task spaces and we present methods that analyze this task space pool in order to acquire task space descriptors that match the observation best. As statistical measures cannot explain importance for all kinds of movements, the presented selection scheme incorporates additional criteria such as an attention-based measure. Further, we introduce methods that make a significant step from purely statistically-driven task space selection towards model-based movement analysis using a simulation of a complex human model. Effort and discomfort of the human teacher is being analyzed and used as a hint for important task elements. All methods are validated with real-world data, gathered using color tracking with a stereo vision system and a VICON motion capturing system.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous estimation of the altitude of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is extremely important when dealing with flight maneuvers like landing, steady flight, etc. Vision based techniques for solving this problem have been underutilized. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to estimate the altitude of a UAV from top-down aerial images taken from a single on-board camera. We use a semi-supervised machine learning approach to solve the problem. The basic idea of our technique is to learn the mapping between the texture information contained in an image to a possible altitude value. We learn an over complete sparse basis set from a corpus of unlabeled images capturing the texture variations. This is followed by regression of this basis set against a training set of altitudes. Finally, a spatio-temporal Markov Random Field is modeled over the altitudes in test images, which is maximized over the posterior distribution using the MAP estimate by solving a quadratic optimization problem with L1 regularity constraints. The method is evaluated in a laboratory setting with a real helicopter and is found to provide promising results with sufficiently fast turnaround time.",

First, real-time perception and response is crucial because of the high presence of obstacles. Second, the limited free space in such a setting places severe restrictions on the size of the aerial vehicle, resulting in a frugal payload budget. We autonomously fly a miniature RC helicopter in small known environments using an on-board light-weight camera as the only sensor. We use an algorithm that combines data-driven image classification with optical flow techniques on the images captured by the camera to achieve real-time 3D localization and navigation. We perform successful autonomous test flights along trajectories in two different indoor settings. Our results demonstrate that our method is capable of autonomous flight even in narrow indoor spaces with sharp corners.",

        "abstract": "General purpose service robots are expected to deal with many different tasks in unknown environments. The number of possible tasks and changing situations prevent developers from writing control programs for all tasks and possible situations. Complex robot tasks are thus accomplished by sequential execution of less complex robot actions that are triggered and configured by a task planner. The question of the appropriate abstraction level of robot actions is still being researched and not discussed conclusively. In this paper, we address the problem of atomicity of robot actions and provide some key properties that have to be considered while designing plan-based robot control systems. Based on these properties, we define and implement atomic skills of different abstraction level for the service robot TASER. The HTN planner JShop2 is used to complete the plan-based control architecture which is evaluated in a set of experiments.",

This approach fills the gab in object search using conventional top-down biased bottom-up attention selection: the latter one fails, if a group of objects is searched whose appearances can not be uniquely described by low-level features used in bottom-up computation models. Two internal robot states, observing and operating, are included to determine the visual selection behavior. A vision guided mobile robot, equipped with an active stereo camera, is used to demonstrate our strategy and evaluate the performance experimentally.",

Over the past few years a number of techniques has been proposed to deal with safe navigation among obstacles in unknown scenarios. Unfortunately many of these methods do not consider obstacle velocities, which can rise some serious questions concerning their safety [1]. This paper will deal with a novel approach to moving obstacle avoidance in holonomic robots. It proposes the Forbidden VelocityMap, a generalization of the Dynamic Window concept [2] that considers obstacle and robot shape, velocity and dynamics, resulting in a safe, reactive real-time navigation algorithm that is able to deal with navigation in unpredictable and cluttered scenarios.",

In contrast to conventional force/torque sensing at the end-effector, placing the sensor at the base allows to implement a compliant behavior of the robot not only with respect to forces acting on the end-effector but also with respect to forces acting on the robot's structure. The resulting control problem is first analyzed in detail for the simplified one-degree-of-freedom case in terms of stability and passivity. Then, an extension to the Cartesian admittance control of a robot manipulator is discussed. Furthermore, it is shown how the steady state properties of the underlying position controller can be taken into account in the design of the outer admittance controller. Finally, a simulation study of the Cartesian admittance controller applied to a three-degrees-of-freedom manipulator is presented.",

Additionally, previous crawler edges sink undesirably on soft ground, particularly when the vehicle body is subject to a sideways tilt. The proposed design solves these drawbacks by adopting a circular cross-section crawler. A prototype. Basic motion experiments with confirm the novel properties of this mechanism: sideways motion and robustness against edge-sink.",

The torque-generation algorithm is presented, and the experimental results by a two-joint robot arm are illustrated. The experimental results demonstrate that the tracking errors of angular velocities by the basis-motion torque composition tend to be smaller than those by the computed torque method.",

        "abstract": "Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide a rich mathematical model to handle real-world sequential decision processes but require a known model to be solved by most approaches. However, mainstream POMDP research focuses on the discrete case and this complicates its application to most realistic problems that are naturally modeled using continuous state spaces. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal control in continuous and partially observable environments when the parameters of the model are unknown. We advocate the use of Gaussian Process Dynamical Models (GPDMs) so that we can learn the model through experience with the environment. Our results on the blimp problem show that the approach can learn good models of the sensors and actuators in order to maximize long-term rewards.",

        "abstract": "We propose a semantic representation and Bayesian model for robot localization using spatial relations among objects that can be created by a single consumer-grade camera and odometry. We first suggest a semantic representation to be shared by human and robot. This representation consists of perceived objects and their spatial relationships, and a qualitatively defined odometry-based metric distance. We refer to this as a topological-semantic distance map. To support our semantic representation, we develop a Bayesian model for localization that enables the location of a robot to be estimated sufficiently well to navigate in an indoor environment. Extensive localization experiments in an indoor environment show that our Bayesian localization technique using a topological-semantic distance map is valid in the sense that localization accuracy improves whenever objects and their spatial relationships are detected and instantiated.",

        "abstract": "This work considers robot localization with an action-associated sparse appearance-based map, under conditions with dynamic change in the environment. In this case, two significant problems must be solved for robust localization. The first involves variations in the environment caused by dynamic objects and changes in illumination, and the second arises from the nature of sparse appearance-based map. That is, a robot must be able to recognize observations taken at slightly different positions and angles within a certain region as identical. In this paper, we address a possible solution to these problems on the basis of a probabilistic model called the Bayes filter. Here, we propose an observation model based LeTO2 function and an action-associated sparse appearance-based map to be used for prediction, update, and final localization steps. In addition, multiple visual features are used to increase the reliability of the observation model. We performed experiments to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach under various conditions with regard to dynamic objects, illumination, and viewpoint. The results clearly demonstrated the value of our approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on an automated batch manufacturing system with material-handling robots (MHRs) and material-processing robots (MPRs). In this robotic manufacturing system, materials transported by the MHRs are processed by the MPRs. These operations cause a bottleneck in the system. Furthermore, the bottleneck induces congestion of the MHRs. In the system, the effect of an operational delay due to bottlenecks affects the entire operation. Accordingly, there is an event in which the congestion extends and the system throughput not only fails to increase but also may become worse, even if more robots are used to improve the productivity. For this challenge, we propose a behavior control method for the MHRs to eliminate or ease the congestion that arises from a bottleneck. Each MHR controls its own behavior adequately by using the external force of a virtual damper in order not to become involved in the congestion. Finally, through a simulation experiment, we show that the proposed control method improves the system throughput and its effectiveness for a more efficient system operation.",

In this paper, we proposed a method of configuration planning of the suspension without any detail geometric data of terrain. The terrain was estimated by the traces of each wheel and the behavior plans for the desired upper level behavior were set up against the constraints of the terrain. Also, an optimal suspension configuration was calculated based on the quasi-static stability and power consumption, and plans for the suspension behavior were made. Validity of the proposed method was checked by simulation using some off-the-shelf programs, and showed that the behavior planning without geometric features of terrain and simplification of the behavior planning for obstacle negotiation were possible.",

We call this problem the group control problem. This problem is complex because it is highly underactuated, dynamic, and requires multi-agent cooperation. In this paper, we present a variety of new motion planning algorithms based on EST, RRT, and PRM methods for shepherds to guide flocks of robots through obstacle-filled environments. We show using simulation on several environments that under certain circumstances, motion planning can find paths that are too complicated for nai\u00bfve \u00bfsimulation only\u00bf approaches. However, inconsistent results indicate that this problem is still in need of additional study.",

The design is based on modelling the behavior of the master and slave which regard state space equations, and also taking into account that perfect transparency cannot be reached. This methodology allows designing the controllers in order to obtain the convergence between the state of the master and the slave. Furthermore, it consequently provides a higher degree of transparency to the operator. The paper explains criteria in achieving convergence between the master and the slave, and so as with transparency on a steady state. A set of equations that calculate controller gains have been obtained by applying such criteria. In order to verify this new methodology, a master-slave system of 3 DoF have been used.",

They are commonly using time delay of arrival (TDOA) or interaural time difference (ITD) algorithm for sound source localization where, especially, the ITD is the difference in arrival time of a sound between two ears. It is largely changed depending on frequency components of sound even though the sound source is located in the same place. In this paper we propose a binaural sound localization system using sparse coding based ITD (SITD) and self-organizing map (SOM). The sparse coding is used for decomposing given sounds into three components: time, frequency and magnitude. Moreover we estimate the azimuth angle through the SOM. This localization system is installed in our robot that has two ears, head and body. We use PeopleBot as a body of the robot.",

Here, we concentrate on realizing an adaptive searching behavior in mobile robot that is simple, yet effective with and without sensing the gradient information. We are interested in two searching behaviors found in biological creatures: bacterial chemotaxis, probably the simplest yet effective gradient sources searching behavior found in living creatures; and Levy walk, specialized random walks with fractal movement trajectories that optimize random search for sparsely and randomly distributed target(s). Our approach is to implement and combine the two searching behaviors based on \u00bfyuragi\u00bf, a Japanese word for biological fluctuation.",

It consists of elastic mechanics, a low-level compliant joint controller and a hierarchical reflex-based control layer. The former is implemented on a DSP while the reflex network is located on a desktop PC. Thus, one is able to utilize distribution as a powerful means to guarantee low latency and scalability. The concept is tested on a prototype leg mounted on a vertical slider that is designed to perform cyclic squat jumps. Thus, a suited mechatronic setup that features highly dynamic actuators as well as energy storage capabilities is derived. Cyclical jumping is employed as a benchmark for the system's performance. Experimental results of the prototype setup as well as simulation runs are presented and compared to human squat jumping.",

        "abstract": "It is known that biologically inspired neural systems could exhibit natural dynamics efficiently and robustly for motion control, especially for rhythmic motion tasks. In addition, humans or animals exhibit natural adaptive motions without considering their kinematic configurations against unexpected disturbances or environment changes. In this paper, we focus on rhythmic arm motions that can be achieved by using a controller based on neural oscillators and virtual force. In comparison with conventional researches, this work treats neither trajectories planning nor inverse kinematics. Instead of those, a few desired points in task-space and a control method with Jacobian transpose and joint velocity damping are merely adopted. In addition, if the joints of robotic arms are coupled to neural oscillators, they may be capable of achieving biologically inspired motions corresponding to environmental changes. To verify the proposed control scheme, we perform some simulations to trace a desired motion and show the potential features related with self-adaptation that enables a three-link planar arm to make adaptive changes from the given motion to a compliant motion. Specifically, we investigate that human-like movements and motion repeatability are satisfied under kinematic redundancy of joints.",

These biorobotic models have been used in conjunction with biological and numerical studies to investigate the effects of the fin's kinematic patterns and structural properties on forces and flows. Data from both biorobotic fins was presented and discussed in terms of the utility of using robotic models for understanding fish locomotor dynamics. Through the use of the robotic fins, it was shown that subtle changes to the kinematics and/or the mechanical properties of fin rays can impact significantly the magnitude, direction, and time course of the 3D forces used in propulsion and maneuvers.",

The proposed guidelines can prove especially useful in the domain of telesurgery where a need exists for well-understood bilateral teleoperation controllers, that show good performance and where many tasks can be characterized by restricted and relatively easily definable impedance regions. This paper firstly analyses the two-port passivity and absolute stability properties of two alternatives of the Position-Force controller. The limitations on achievable performance when guaranteeing absolute stability with arbitrary environments are detailed. Next, a novel method, called Bounded Environment Passivity method is introduced. This method enables the design of teleoperation controllers that show passive behaviour for interactions with an environment that varies over a given range of impedances. A set of guidelines that allow a smarter trade-off between performance and stability follows. The theoretical results are verified experimentally on a 1-d.o.f. teleoperation setup.",

These results can be extended to three dimensions using controlled geometric reduction for open-chain robots, by which stable 3-D walking gaits are built from known sagittal-plane limit cycles. We apply this method to the standard and with-torso compass-gait (hipless) bipeds, showing straight-ahead walking gaits (i.e., stable 1-step periodic limit cycles) as well as h-step turning in full circles (i.e., stable h-periodic limit cycles). These constant-curvature maneuvers are composed of stable 1-periodic turning gaits modulo heading change, demonstrating two types of gaits for directional dynamic walking in three dimensions.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the architecture and implementation of a distributed autonomous gardening system. The garden is a mesh network of robots and plants. The gardening robots are mobile manipulators with an eye-in-hand camera. They are capable of locating plants in the garden, watering them, and locating and grasping fruit. The plants are potted cherry tomatoes enhanced with sensors and computation to monitor their well-being (e.g. soil humidity, state of fruits) and with networking to communicate servicing requests to the robots. Task allocation, sensing and manipulation are distributed in the system and de-centrally coordinated. We describe the architecture of this system and present experimental results for navigation, object recognition and manipulation.",

        "abstract": "Suspicion of water ice deposits in the lunar south-polar region have sparked new interest into the earth's smaller companion, and robotic crater sample return missions are being considered by a number of space agencies. The difficult terrain with an inclination of over 30\u00b0, eternal darkness and temperatures of less than -173\u00b0C make this a difficult task. In this paper we present a novel, bio-inspired light-weight system design, which demonstrates a possible approach for such a mission. The robot managed to come first in the Lunar Robotic Challenge (LRC), organised by the European Space Agency (ESA) in October 2008. Using a remote operated robot, we demonstrated to climb into and out of a lunar-like crater with inclination of more than 35\u00b0 on loose substrate, and performed the collection and delivery of a 100 g soil sample without the aid of external illumination.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Outdoor camera networks are becoming ubiquitous in critical urban areas of large cities around the world. Although current applications of camera networks are mostly limited to video surveillance, recent research projects are exploiting advances on outdoor robotics technology to develop systems that put together networks of cameras and mobile robots in people assisting tasks. Such systems require the creation of robot navigation systems in urban areas with a precise calibration of the distributed camera network. Despite camera calibration has been an extensively studied topic, the calibration (intrinsic and extrinsic) of large outdoor camera networks with no overlapping view fields, and likely to suffer frequent recalibration, poses novel challenges in the development of practical methods for user-assisted calibration that minimize intervention times and maximize precision. In this paper we propose the utilization of Laser Range Finder (LRF) data covering the area of the camera network to support the calibration process and develop a semi-automated methodology allowing quick and precise calibration of large camera networks. The proposed methods have been tested in a real urban environment and have been applied to create direct mappings (homographies) between image coordinates and world points in the ground plane (walking areas) to support person and robot detection and localization algorithms.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Solving visual features' correspondence and dealing with missing data are two factors of limitations for points registration techniques. To tackle this problem, we conceived a pattern, primarily designed for structured lighting vision systems, which may also be used for camera calibration purposes. The pattern design previously presented provides a huge of benefits. Among them, we firstly present a new calibration technique of a structured lighting system and secondly an automatic distortion compensation based on a printed pattern. These two well-known issues are very useful in 3D vision-based metrology with range data, for instance for model-based visual robot control, especially when the model is incrementally built with a real-time 3D reconstruction of moving surfaces. Perhaps, one of the most significant profit with a high Hamming distance pattern is the ability to reliably decode its projected individual elements even if several of items are missing, as it greatly extends the range of measurements volume. A technique which solves the distortion parameters by means of a robust M-estimator algorithm is presented. It uses a printed pattern and it allows the distortion be corrected with a single view and without the computation of other (intrinsic/extrinsic) parameters, even in presence of occlusions. Experimental results, in one hand by means of a printed pattern for the distortion compensation of a rigid endoscope and on the other hand by means of a projected pattern for the calibration of the structured lighting system, show very good performance for the 3-D reconstruction.",

With the decreasing availability of skilled labour and increasing emphasis on reuse of materials, there is an opportunity to introduce robots that can replace labour for the simpler tasks. This paper describes a robot to perform the task of removing tile screws from suspended ceiling beams. The robot uses a specially-designed tool mounted at the end of an arm. This tool removes screws by turning them between two rollers. The tool is moved down the beam in a single motion, allowing it to remove many screws fast with little operator interaction. RT-Middleware is used as the implementation architecture, which facilitated development by simplifying testing of individual components.",

Experiments of the method for various decomposition granularities and various adjustments of the planner settings show that using a bias towards the goal while choosing a random configuration reduces the paths length but can cause failures, that the choice of the criterion for analysing the environment is important, and that the method can profit from a reuse of already made computations in a part of the environment.",

        "abstract": "One of the main challenges when creating an undergraduate introduction to robotics course is connecting the theory taught in the lectures with the current practices of research. The primary cause of this difficulty is an inability to find a hardware solution that is powerful enough to run complex cutting-edge algorithms yet inexpensive enough to be purchased by an undergraduate class budget. An ideal system needs to have a gentle learning curve to allow students with minimal background in the field to get a robot up and running. Lastly, a fleet of classroom robots needs to be easy to administrate and maintain given the limited time of a Teaching Assistant. Our approach is to implement a centralized server system. In this system individual robots are inexpensive yet capable of establishing a WiFi link to a main server so that all the compilation and system administration, as well as much of the computationally intensive processing, are done on that server. We find that this solution saves both time and money and provides an effective teaching tool. This paper describes the hardware and software architecture of the system, and example applications implemented by undergraduate students.",

A bending type actuator using PVC gel was studied previously [4]-[6]. We have proposed the structure of a contraction type actuator to construct an artificial muscle, and we have conducted some experiments using the single-layer PVC gel actuator [8]. In this paper, we investigate the characteristics of the multi-layer PVC gel actuator experimentally and evaluate its specifications in terms of the composition of PVC gel and the structure of the mesh electrode. The experimental results showed that the contraction rate of the actuator was about 14%, the response rate was 7Hz, and the output force was 4kPa. Also, we found that the stiffness of the actuator increased as the applied dc field increased like human muscle. The characteristics of the PVC gel actuator are shown to be very effective for constructing an artificial muscle.",

To realize the full potentials of networked robotic systems, an integration of communication issues with motion planning/control is necessary. While considerable progress has been made in the area of networked robotic systems, communication channels are typically considered ideal or ideal within a certain radius of the transmitter, both considerable oversimplifications of wireless channels. It is the goal of this paper to provide a comprehensive overview of the key characteristics of wireless channels, as relevant to networked robotic operations. In particular, we provide a probabilistic framework for characterization of the underlying multi-scale dynamics of a wireless link: small-scale fading, large-scale fading and path loss. We furthermore confirm these mathematical models with channel measurements made in our building. We also discuss channel characterization based on the knowledge available on the geometry and dielectric properties of the environment.",

        "abstract": "One of the major limitations in the development of ultrasensitive electrochemical biosensors based on one-dimensional nanostructure is the difficulty involved with reliably fabricating nanoelectrode arrays (NEAs). In previous work, a simple, robust and scalable wafer-scale fabrication method to produce multiplexed biosensors is introduced. Each sensor chip consists of nine individually addressable arrays that uses electron beam patterned vertically aligned carbon nanofibers (VACNFs) as the sensing element. To ensure nanoelectrode behavior with higher sensitivity, VACNFs were precisely grown on 100 nm Ni dots with 1 \u00bfm spacing on each micro pad. However, in order to examine the quality and measure the height and diameter of the VACNFs, some surface detection and measurement tool at the nanoscale level is needed. In this paper, we introduce an approach to measure these nano-scale features through atomic force microscope (AFM). With this method, both the 2D and 3D images of sample surface are generated and the sizes of carbon nanofibers and cavities are obtained. Furthermore, statistical analysis is carried out to enable improvement of VACNFs growth and fabrication.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Piezoelectric cantilevers have proved their performances for actuating microgrippers dedicated to micromanipulation and microassembly tasks. While the control of one degree-of-freedom (dof) piezocantilevers have been well whelmed, the control of multi-dof one has not been addressed. Indeed, to assemble complex structures, the use of multidof microgrippers is recognized. Unfortunately, strong coupling between the axis and nonlinearities indeniably limit their performances. This paper deals with the modeling and control of a piezocantilever that has 2 degrees of freedom: in-plane and out of plane deflections. While such a characteristic allows the microgrippers perform both orientation and translation during micromanipulation/microassembly tasks, the strong coupling between the two dof makes difficult their control. Moreover, nonlinearities (hysteresis and creep) raise when the piezocantilever is used in high deformation. To overcome these, we consider the coupling as a disturbance, model the nonlinearities with the quadrilateral approximation and we apply a robust H\u00bf controller that accounts them. The experiments show the efficiency of the synthesized controller and the obtained performances are convenient for micromanipulation/ microassembly tasks.",

Our proposed approach proposes a robust geometric mapping pipeline for large input datasets that extracts relevant objects useful for a personal robotic assistant to perform manipulation tasks. The objects are segmented out from partial views and a reconstructed model is computed by fitting geometric primitive classes such as planes, spheres, cylinders, and cones. The geometric shape coefficients are then used to reconstruct missing data. Residual points are resampled and triangulated, to create smooth decoupled surfaces that can be manipulated. The resulted map is represented as a hybrid concept and is comprised of 3D shape coefficients and triangular meshes used for collision avoidance in manipulation routines.",

In previous work, this approach has been experimentally verified and validated for controlling the motion of mobile multi-robot systems ranging from land rovers to autonomous boats. In this paper we introduce a compact collision avoidance algorithm that operates at the level of the cluster, leading to coordinated translational and rotational motions that allow obstacles to be avoided while maintaining the relative geometry of the cluster. This paper formulates the potential-field based obstacle avoidance algorithm, describes its integration within the cluster space control architecture, and presents successful experimental results of its application to two simple, diverse multi-robot testbeds.",

        "abstract": "A joint learning approach is described that meets a major challenge with social robots - developing a methodology for learning communicative behaviors. We focus on interaction rule that is relationship between a robot's action and a partner's response. In this approach a robot is simultaneously a learner and proposer of interaction rules. The human partner and robot continuously search for and co-create new rules as inspired by the social games played between an infant and a caregiver. A simple and universal scheme with response prediction and habituation/dishabituation was developed, and a robot model was built using the scheme. The robot generates actions, observes the partner's response, and get to predict them. It identifies relationships between its actions and the responses, and generates actions designed to elicit particular responses from the partner. After it is habituated to the responses, it generates other actions to search for other rules. In experiments of human-robot interaction based on this model and using a ball, different patterns of interaction emerged, such as passing the ball back and forth, rolling and catching, and feint passing. Response prediction and appropriate habituation supported the emergence of interactions, indicating that the scheme and the model are effective. This joint learning should lead to natural communication between human partners and social robots beyond teach/taught relationship.",

        "abstract": "In multi-robot systems, task allocation and coordination are two fundamental problems that share high synergy. Although multi-robot architectures typically separate them into distinct layers, relevant improvement may be expected from solutions that are able to concurrently handle them at the same \u00bflevel\u00bf. This paper proposes a novel framework, called CoMutaR (coalition formation based on multitasking robots), which is used for both tackle task distribution among teams of mobile robots, and to guarantee the coordination within the formed teams. Robot capabilities are modelled as actions, independent modules whose inputs do not depend on the robot that generated it. Solutions to tasks are devised as coalitions of actions, that can be spread amongst the available robots. We also define the concept of share-restricted resources, which are periodically checked and updated by the actions in the system. In contrast to prior approaches, this mechanism enables to quickly determine if two actions can be executed simultaneously, allowing a single robot to execute multiple tasks concurrently. A single-round auction protocol is used to automatically discover and form coalitions. Once a coalition is formed, coordination among robots is modelled as constraints imposed over the share-restricted resources. Finally, we have successfully implemented and applied CoMutaR in typical scenarios like object transportation, area surveillance, and multi-robot box pushing. Experimental results demonstrate that the system is able to provide good solutions even in the case of severe failures in participating robots.",

We model indoor environments using the following visual cues from a stereo camera: local invariant features for object recognition and their 3D positions for object location representation. We also use a 2D laser range finder. Therefore, we can build a hybrid local node for a topological map that is composed of an object location map and a spatial layout map. Based on this modeling, we suggest a coarse-to-fine strategy for the global localization. The coarse pose is obtained by means of object recognition and point cloud fitting, and then its fine pose is estimated with a probabilistic scan matching algorithm. With real experiments, we show that our proposed method can be an effective global localization algorithm.",

This type of vision system has many potential applications in mobile robotics. This paper is concerned with the design of a robust image-based control scheme using a catadioptric vision system mounted on a mobile robot. We exploit the fact that the decoupling property contributes to the robustness of a control method. More precisely, from the image of a point, we propose a minimal and decoupled set of features measurable on any catadioptric vision system. Using the minimal set, a classical control method is proved to be robust in the presence of point range errors. Finally, experimental results with a coarsely calibrated mobile robot validate the robustness of the new decoupled scheme.",

        "abstract": "One of the key competencies required in modern robots is finding objects in complex environments. For the last decade, significant progress in computer vision and machine learning literatures has increased the recognition performance of well localized objects. However, the performance of these techniques is still far from human performance, especially in cluttered environments. We believe that the performance gap between robots and humans is due in part to humans' use of an attention system. According to cognitive psychology, the human visual system uses two stages of visual processing to interpret visual input. The first stage is a pre-attentive process perceiving scenes fast and coarsely to select potentially interesting regions. The second stage is a more complex process analyzing the regions hypothesized in the previous stage. These two stages play an important role in enabling efficient use of the limited cognitive resources available. Inspired by this biological fact, we propose a visual attentional object categorization approach for robots that enables object recognition in real environments under a critical time limitation. We quantitatively evaluate the performance for recognition of objects in highly cluttered scenes without significant loss of detection rates across several experimental settings.",

        "abstract": "Although primates can facilely maintain long-duration tracking of an object without infection of occlusion or other near similar distracters, it remains a challenge for computer vision system. Studies in psychology suggest that the ability of primates to focus selective attention on the spatial properties of an object is necessary to observe object quickly and efficiently while focus selective attention on the feature properties of object is necessary to render it more prominent from the distracters. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-feature attentional visual tracking (SFAVT) algorithm to encode both. In SFAVT, tracking is treated as an on-line binary classification problem where spatial attention is employed in early selective procedure to construct foreground/background appearance model by identifying image patches with good localization properties, and in late selective procedure to update models by maintaining image patches with good discrimitive motion properties. Meanwhile, feature attention works in mode seeking procedure to help select feature spaces that best separate a target from background. The on-line tuned adaptive appearance models by those selected feature spaces are used to train a classifier for target localization, then. Experiments under various real-world conditions show that this algorithm is able to track an object influenced by dramatic distracters while is of comparable time efficiency with meanshift.",

Joysticking each one or carrying them physically is impractical. None of the robots are particularly sophisticated in their ability to plan or reason. Prior work on flocking and formation control has addressed the transport of a robot group that maintains its integrity by explicitly controlling coherence. We show how flocking emerges as a consequence of each robot contending for space near the human operator. A coherent flock can be made to follow a leader in this manner thereby solving the CTR problem. We also present the design of a hand-worn IMU-based gesture interface which allows the human operator to issue simple commands to the group. A preliminary experimental evaluation of the system shows robust CTR with different leader behaviors.",

        "abstract": "We address the motion planning problem for a manipulator system with base pose uncertainty, e.g., when the manipulator is mounted on a mobile base. Using a particle based representation for the uncertainty, we extend the PRM (probabilistic roadmap) approach to deal with this base uncertainty. Because of the uncertainty, a path for the manipulator is associated with a probability of being collision-free, which fundamentally changes the nature of the PRM's query phase. We plan for a shortest path such that the probability of the manipulator being collision-free is higher than a user defined threshold, were the manipulator to follow the path. The path query problem becomes a collision probability constrained shortest path problem (CP-CSPP), and is shown as NP-hard w.r.t. the number of the particles. We then present a lazy query algorithm, called Lazy-CPC-PRM (collision probability constrained LazyPRM), based on a k-shortest path algorithm in conjunction with a labeling algorithm. Lazy-CPC-PRM exploits a key insight that if a portion of a path considered by the algorithm is invalid (the probability of it being collision-free is less than a threshold) or is dominated by another sub-path, then all the longer paths containing this portion can not be the solution path. This leads to significant efficiency gains in practice. Although, worst case complexity is exponential in the number of particles, we empirically show the effectiveness of our query algorithm with 30 particles for a simulated 3-dof manipulator mounted on a mobile base.",

This approach can be seen as an extension of our previous papers based on the luminance. Indeed, as we did for the luminance, color attributes are directly used in the control law avoiding therefore any complex images processing as features extraction or matching. We propose in this paper several potential color features and then a way to select a priori the best choice among them with respect to the scene being observed. Experimental results validate as well the interest of using color attributes as visual features as our selection process.",

These point features are matched between pairs of frames and linked into image trajectories at video rate, generating what it is called visual odometry, i.e. motion estimates from visual input alone. With respect to previously proposed approaches, the main novelty of our proposal is that the matching between sets of features associated to stereo pairs and between sets of image features associated to consecutive frames are conducted by means of a fast combined constraint matching algorithm. Besides, the efficiency of the approach is increased by using a closed-form solution to estimate the final robot displacement between consecutive acquired frames. We have tested the proposed approach for navigational purposes in a real environment. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the proposal.",

Although technically a local method in practice it demonstrates almost global convergence. However IBVS performs very poorly for cases that involve large rotations about the optical axis. It is well known that re-parameterizing the problem by using polar, instead of Cartesian coordinates, of feature points overcomes this limitation. First, simulation and experimental results are presented to show the complementarity of these two parameterizations. We then describe a new hybrid visual servo strategy based on combining polar and Cartesian image Jacobians.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In the recent past, the recognition and localization of objects based on local point features has become a widely accepted and utilized method. Among the most popular features are currently the SIFT features, the more recent SURF features, and region-based features such as the MSER. For time-critical application of object recognition and localization systems operating on such features, the SIFT features are too slow (500\u2013600 ms for images of size 640\u00d7480 on a 3GHz CPU). The faster SURF achieve a computation time of 150\u2013240 ms, which is still too slow for active tracking of objects or visual servoing applications. In this paper, we present a combination of the Harris corner detector and the SIFT descriptor, which computes features with a high repeatability and very good matching properties within approx. 20 ms. While just computing the SIFT descriptors for computed Harris interest points would lead to an approach that is not scale-invariant, we will show how scale-invariance can be achieved without a time-consuming scale space analysis. Furthermore, we will present results of successful application of the proposed features within our system for recognition and localization of textured objects. An extensive experimental evaluation proves the practical applicability of our approach.",

The haptic system is covered with a flexible outer material which role is to absorb contact impacts and to cast local surface profile on which the robot can take support. This overall system allows having a combined haptic sensing with safe and robust physical interaction with both the environment and the human using active compliance.

In this paper, we aim to design a compact work cell (spatial requirement) and to minimize its task completion time (temporal requirement) to a value set as a constraint. By doing so, a work cell occupies a minimal space and achieves its desired throughput. The work cell size is evaluated based on the size and the swept volume of components. This evaluation is important since a robot arm can have a very large swept volume depending on a given task. To satisfy the spatial and temporal requirements, we propose the integration of the base placement optimization, goal rearrangement, and motion coordination between the robot arm and the positioning table. Furthermore, we introduce two motion coordination schemes based on the spatial and temporal requirements. We showed the effectiveness of the proposed method through simulations.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present the mechanical design of a compact magnetic wheeled robot - with the goal to do inspection and vibration measurements in the housings of large generators and similar environments in power plants. After a detailed analysis of the specifications in this application, we present a new vehicle structure that allows for passing sharp concave corners - even with low friction coefficient between wheels and surface - and without using an additional active DOF. The advantages of this structure and the core parameters for its optimization are described in a quasi-static 2D calculation model. A prototype was implemented and successfully tested both in laboratory and real environments. The paper concludes pointing out the future improvements for a final industrial version.",

In this paper, we extend the proposed approach to larger, more realistic kinematic models, which can better represent a larger variety of human motions. These larger models may include spherical in addition to revolute joints. We examine the effects on segmentation performance due to motion representation choice, and compare the segmentation efficacy when Cartesian or joint angle data is used. The approach is tested on whole body human motion data modeled with a 42DoF kinematic model. The results indicate that Cartesian data seems to correspond most closely to the human evaluation of segment points. The experiments also demonstrate the efficacy of the segmentation approach for large kinematic models and a variety of human motions.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we present the use of complementarity-based dynamic simulation algorithms for kinodynamic motion planning. Dynamic simulation algorithms are used as local planning methods in sampling-based motion planning algorithms to find inputs that ensure the resulting trajectory satisfies the dynamics constraints. However, the inputs are not guaranteed to give collision-free path segments. The inputs, chosen either by random sampling or from a discretization of the available inputs, are rejected if the path segment is not collision free. In cluttered environments, finding a feasible input is difficult and sensitive to the duration \u00bft of application of the input, and to the discretization resolution of the input set. When the collision constraints (or any inequality constraints on the state of the robot) are modeled as a set of complementarity constraints, the dynamic simulation algorithm gives a path segment that touches the obstacles and a set of contact forces whenever the robot makes contact with the obstacles. The sum of the chosen input forces and the contact forces transformed to the input space gives a control input that guarantees a collision-free path segment (provided it is within the actuator bounds). Thus in cluttered environments, using a complementarity-based dynamic simulation algorithm, we can find a feasible input that is relatively insensitive to the choice of \u00bft and the discretization resolution of the input set. We present simple simulation examples showing the advantages of our algorithm in cluttered environments.",

        "abstract": "Fluid bipedal locomotion remains a significant challenge for humanoid robotics. Recent bio-inspired approaches have made significant progress by using small numbers of tightly coupled neurons, called central pattern generators (CPGs). Our approach exchanges complexity of the neuron model for complexity of the network, gradually building a network of simple neurons capable of complex behaviors. We show this approach generates controllers de novo that are able to control 3D bipedal locomotion up to 10 meters. This results holds for robots with human-proportionate morphologies across 95% of normal human variation. The resulting networks are then examined to discover neural structures that arise unusually often, lending some insight into the workings of otherwise opaque controllers.",

One of the key technologies in this framework is the torque transformer, which enables the implementation of joint torque control on the traditional joint position controlled robots. In this framework, the torque control is accomplished by converting desired joint torque command into instantaneous increments of joint velocity command. Through the transformer, the Operational Space Formulation was applied to account for the dynamics of the system on the current joint position controlled robots. This approach was experimentally implemented on the physical humanoid robot, HONDA ASIMO's upper body control. The ZMP based stable balance controller of ASIMO was integrated to control the lower body of the robot. In this framework, dynamics control by the torque transformer and stable position based balance controller were connected and coordinated together on the current position controlled humanoid robot. The paper presents modeling process of the torque transformer, whole body controller and the results of the implementation which demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.",

        "abstract": "Many critical elements for statically stable walking for legged robots have been known for a long time, including stability criteria based on support polygons, good foothold selection, recovery strategies to name a few. All these criteria have to be accounted for in the planning as well as the control phase. Most legged robots usually employ high gain position control, which means that it is crucially important that the planned reference trajectories are a good match for the actual terrain, and that tracking is accurate. Such an approach leads to conservative controllers, i.e. relatively low speed, ground speed matching, etc. Not surprisingly such controllers are not very robust - they are not suited for the real world use outside of the laboratory where the knowledge of the world is limited and error prone. Thus, to achieve robust robotic locomotion in the archetypical domain of legged systems, namely complex rough terrain, where the size of the obstacles are in the order of leg length, additional elements are required. A possible solution to improve the robustness of legged locomotion is to maximize the compliance of the controller. While compliance is trivially achieved by reduced feedback gains, for terrain requiring precise foot placement (e.g. climbing rocks, walking over pegs or cracks) compliance cannot be introduced at the cost of inferior tracking. Thus, model-based control and - in contrast to passive dynamic walkers - active balance control is required. To achieve these objectives, in this paper we add two crucial elements to legged locomotion, i.e., floating-base inverse dynamics control and predictive force control, and we show that these elements increase robustness in face of unknown and unanticipated perturbations (e.g. obstacles). Furthermore, we introduce a novel line-based COG trajectory planner, which yields a simpler algorithm than traditional polygon based methods and creates the appropriate input to our control system.We show results from bot...

In this paper, we apply the computational framework of passive motion paradigm for task specific composition and coordination of the movements of a limb, network of limbs (e.g. left arm-waist-right arm) or networks of external objects coupled to the body of the 53 degrees of freedom humanoid robot `iCub'. The basic PMP model is further extended by formulation of a pair of branching nodes that allow compositionality and transfer of force fields from one relaxation network to another. The generality of the proposed approach is further illustrated using simulations of whole body reaching (WBR) tasks from a quiet standing posture that recruits virtually all the joints of the upper limbs, lower limbs, and trunk, binding together a large number of degrees of freedom into a functional unit that combines a focal task (reaching a target with the hand) and a postural task (keeping the projection of the center of mass within the bipedal support area). Preliminary comparisons of the solutions generated by the computational model with the movements of human subjects performing similar WBR tasks are presented.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach, compressive mobile sensing, to use mobile sensors to sample and reconstruct sensing fields based on compressive sensing. Compressive sensing is an emerging research field based on the fact that a small number of linear measurements can recover a sparse signal without losing any useful information. Using compressive sensing, the signal can be recovered by a sampling rate that is much lower than the requirements from the well-known Shannon sampling theory. The proposed compressive mobile sensing approach has not only the merits of compressive sensing, but also the flexibility of different sampling densities for areas of different interests. A special measurement process makes it different from normal compressive sensing. Adopting importance sampling, compressive mobile sensing enables mobile sensors to move adaptively and acquire more samples from more important areas. A motion planning algorithm is designed based on the result of sparsity analysis to locate areas of more interests. At last, experimental results of 2-D mapping are presented as an implementation compressive mobile sensing.",

Aim of our project LittleApe is to build a small and extreme lightweight robot that is capable of walking on two and four legs as well as of changing from a four-legged posture to a two-legged posture, manipulating small objects, and which is also able to climb. LittleApe is modelled with attributes of a chimpanzee regarding limb proportions, spinal column, centre of mass, walking pattern, and range of motion. The concept of LittleApe is tested in simulation while building the real system. Two aspects were chosen to evaluate the concept described in detail within this paper. The first aspect comprises the use of an evolutionary method and the comparison of different morphologies. Based on the results from the first one, the second aspect deals with the manoeuvrability of the LittleApe robot.",

This strategy is founded on the traversal of path trees in such a way that connectivity to a static control center is always maintained, while ensuring that any target that is reachable by a chain consisting of all robots is eventually visited. In this work we improve the strategy performance by extending its sequential one-task-at-a-time execution approach with concurrent execution of tasks. We demonstrate that the general problem is NP-hard and offer several heuristic approaches to tackle it. We study the improvements that these heuristics can offer in regard to several important variables like network range and clustering of targets, and finally compare their performance over the optimal solutions for small problem instances. In summary, we offer a complete characterization of the new concurrent capabilities of the CONNECTTREE strategy.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, parallel link mechanisms for multi drive linear motors (MDLMs) are proposed. The multi drive is a control method for linear motors in which a number of moving parts are individually driven on one stator part. Various configurations of parallel link mechanisms which were constructed for MDLMs are proposed. These mechanisms offer a wide range of motion in addition to the existing characteristics that parallel mechanisms provide, namely, rigid mechanisms, high precision, and high speed. Moreover, they are suitable for force control because of their low friction direct drive actuators. In this paper, the kinematic and dynamic characteristics of 2-DOF (xy) and 3-DOF (xy\u03b8) planar parallel link mechanisms are investigated. A singularity analysis and internal force control method for a 3-DOF with 4 redundant moving parts is derived. The condition of dynamic decoupling and the constant inertia design of a 2-DOF with 2 moving parts and a 3-DOF with 4 moving parts are derived. The effectiveness of these analyses is then confirmed by numerical simulation. Based on this analysis, a prototype of the 3-DOF with 4 moving parts is designed and developed.",

Generally, it is widely said that this type of learning method is not appropriated to obtain dynamic motions because Markov property is not necessarily guaranteed during the dynamic task. However, in this study, we try to avoid this problem by embedding the dynamic information in the robotic state space; the applicability of the proposed method is considered using both the real robot and dynamic simulator. This paper, in particular, discusses how the robot with 5-DOF, in which the Q-Learning algorithm is implemented, acquires a giant-swing motion. Further, we describe the reward effects on the Q-Learning. Finally, this paper demonstrates that the application of the Q-Learning enable the robot to perform a very attractive giant-swing motion.",

        "abstract": "Localization is a part of many automotive applications where safety is of crucial importance. We think that the best way to guarantee the safety in these applications is to guarantee the results of their embedded localization algorithms. Unfortunately localization of vehicles is mostly solved by Bayesian methods which (due to their structure) can only guarantee their results in a probabilistic way. Interval analysis allows an alternative approach with bounded-error state estimation. Such an approach provides a bounded set of configurations that is guaranteed to surround the actual vehicle configuration. We have validated the bounded-error state estimation with an outdoor vehicle equipped with odometers, a GPS receiver and a gyro. With the experimental results we compare the bounded-error state estimation with the particle filter localization in terms of consistency and computation time.",

To use the advantages of the potential for humans and robots to work together as a team in industrial settings, the most important issues are safety for the human and an easy way to describe tasks for the robot. In this work, we present an approach of a hierarchical structured control of industrial robots for joint-action scenarios. Multiple atomic tasks including dynamic collision avoidance, operational position, and posture can be combined in an arbitrary order respecting constraints of higher priority tasks. The controller flow is based on the theory of orthogonal projection using nullspaces and constraint least-square optimization. To proof the approach, we present three collaboration scenarios between a human and an industrial robot.",

We describe the motions that perform tasks by applying impulsive force as \u00bfimpact motion\u00bf. This paper presents a contact dynamics model of a humanoid robot for such a motion. Multibody dynamics and effect of a servo controller on impulsive force are also considered in the proposed model. The proposed model can estimate impulsive force at low computation cost compared with full-featured dynamics computation methods. The estimation results of each motion are compared with simulation results by OpenHRP3. The maximum error of impulse is about 6 (%). Therefore, the proposed model is useful for estimating dynamics behavior of a humanoid robot.",

In this setting, traditional methods of complete solution is not available. Based on wrench space information of the input, our proposed algorithm clusters the input into groups and chooses a representative contact point from each group. A global graph structure for regrasp planning is then constructed using all force closure grasps that can be formed only by representative contact points. Also described are approaches for finding a regrasping sequence from an arbitrary grasp to a grasp in the global structure. Once such regrasping sequences are found for linking the input initial and target grasps to the global graph structure, the regrasp planning problem can be solved as a graph search. The results from preliminary experiments indicate that our method can solve many problem instances efficiently.",

In this paper we present the motion control design for the platform, which has been developed within the homonymous European research project. The objective is to compensate the intentional motion of the user, so as to keep her/him always close to the platform center while limiting the perceptual effects due to actuation commands. The controller acts at the acceleration level, using suitable observers to estimate the unmeasurable intentional walker's velocity and acceleration. A moving reference position is used to limit the accelerations felt by the user in critical transients, e.g., when the walker suddenly stops motion. Experimental results are reported that show the benefit of designing separate control gains in the two orthogonal directions (lateral and sagittal) of a frame attached to the walker.",

First, the position and posture of the body of the robot are adjusted to maximize the number of choices for foot placement of the next swing leg. The more choices the robot has to select the next suitable foothold, the better it will be to cope with rough terrain. Second, an effective foothold search algorithm is developed. The foothold search algorithm not only tries to find a valid foothold but also tries to maintain high adaptability of the robot. For implementing the algorithm, some new concepts such as potential swing direction, complementary kinematic margin and elliptical set of candidate footholds are also proposed. The effectiveness of this procedure in improving the adaptability of a quadruped robot moving in challenging terrain is verified in both simulation and experiment.",

This combination endows the robot with the ability to realize hierarchically organised learned tasks in parallel, using tasks null space projectors built upon the learned models. We illustrate the proposed method on a simulated 3 degrees of freedom planar robot. This system is used as a benchmark to compare our method to an alternative approach based on learning an extended Jacobian. We show the better versatility of the retained approach with respect to the latter.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new approach to the locomotion control of the trident snake robot, focusing on its \u00bfdouble-linked\u00bf case where the robot is composed of a triangular body and three branches of double-linked snakelike legs. Originally, this robot was proposed by the authors as a novel example of nonholonomic mobile robot. This robot is quite interesting from a theoretical point of view; the well-known LARC (Lie Algebra Rank Condition) for its nonlinear controllability has a unique structure that it contains two `generator' vector-fields and higher order Lie brackets, which makes its control problem extremely challenging. In this paper, for this difficult control problem, we first propose a design algorithm which partially achieves the desired locomotion. Then we discover that the resulting motion may or may not be a stable limit cycle, depending on the eigenvalues of the corresponding discrete-time dynamics on its Poincare\u00bf map. Finally, we propose a full controller design by combining the stable limit cycles. The validity of the proposed idea is examined by numerical simulations.",

The paper provides three contributions: 1) A partially feedback linearized model of a planar snake robot is developed. 2) A stabilizability analysis is presented proving that any asymptotically stabilizable control law for a planar snake robot to an equilibrium point must be time-varying. 3) A controllability analysis is presented proving that planar snake robots are not controllable when the viscous ground friction is uniform, but that a snake robot becomes strongly accessible when the viscous ground friction is non-uniform. The analysis also shows that the snake robot does not satisfy sufficient conditions for small-time local controllability (STLC).",

The simplified model of the bicycle with the balancer is derived from Lagrangian and nonholonomic constraints with respect to translation and rotation relative to the ground plane. We derived a controller using a steering torque and a balancer torque to stabilize the bicycle at zero linear velocity. The output-zeroing controller is designed by using the angular momentum of two-link system and by adding the effect of steering angle to the derivative of the angular momentum. Numerical simulation and experimental results are shown to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.",

This paper presents an approach to cooperative multi-robot reinforcement learning based on a hybrid state space representation of the environment to achieve both task learning and heterogeneous role emergence in a unified framework. The methodology also involves learning space reduction through a neural perception module and a progressive rescheduling algorithm that interleaves online execution and relearning to adapt to environmental uncertainties and enhance performance. The approach aims to reduce combinatorial complexity inherent in role-task optimization, and achieves a satisficing solution to complex team-based tasks, rather than a globally optimal solution. Empirical evaluation of the proposed framework is conducted through simulation of a foraging task.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses a flexible cooperative navigation system for small robot teams. The members of these groups move in formation, but with enough flexibility to be able to avoid obstacles and adapt to the environment shape. This approach is based on an analysis of the environment on a grid-based model that permits each robot to continuously evaluate the situation in which it is, in order to decide the best of the three developed navigation strategies, one for each situation type. Moreover, by using this model the robot cooperation for a coordinate navigation is improved, allowing each robot to share the observations with the other robots. So the field of view of each robot of the team on which it makes the decisions is enlarged. The system is implemented in a decentralized way so the number of robots is not a main issue, thus being scalable. Eventually, initial formation topology can be modified, in order to comply with the environment while the mission is accomplished. The system and the strategies are evaluated by means of simulations, showing the robustness against possible blocking situations.",

        "abstract": "Surgical robotic systems have a great impact on the application of laparoscopic surgeries in the operating room. The advent of externally operated surgical robots has prompted the first significant shift in general laparoscopic surgeries. Miniature in vivo robots that can be completely inserted in to the abdomen are also being studied to reduce patient trauma. Whereas external surgical robots have a constrained workspace but provide good speed and force capabilities; miniature surgical robots have good local workspace characteristics, but are generally slower and not as powerful. Current efforts to address these limitations include cooperatively using multiple surgical robots to increase dexterous manipulation capabilities, fault tolerance, and overall robustness. In this paper, a cooperative surgical robot system composed of an externally actuated, compact tool-positioning surgical robot, CoBRASurge (Compact Bevel-geared Robot for Advanced Surgery), and an in vivo fixed-base, task assistant Dexterous Robot, is presented to perform laparoscopic surgical procedures. The CoBRASurge functions as a gross end-effector positioning robot and the Dexterous Robot performs internal surgical tasks with fine accuracy, effectively increasing the flexibility of the robot system. The surgical procedure successfully demonstrates the feasibility of using CoBRASurge to provide the surgeon with stable and remotely adjustable repositioning of in vivo robots for laparoscopic procedures in the peritoneal cavity.",

Using this algorithm an exoskeletal walking support system could help a paraplegia patient walking comfortablly. At first, a pair of gloves with several DOFs is developed to convey a wearer's intention to the walking support system. He/she swings both his/her index fingers as to simulate foot motions of his/her walking. The amplitude and period of the swing corresponds to a step length and period of the walk, respectively. Pronation/supination of the wrist joint of his/her right arm corresponds to a walk direction. The cooperative control algorithm based on a cart-table model designs trajectories of each joint for stable walking pattern that satisfies the intention expressed by the wearer's hand motion and then the designed walking pattern is executed in realtime by the walking support system. As the first trial, a small humanoid robot \u00bfHRP-2m\u00bf is used for safety as a control target that will be a combination of a wearer and the walking support system in the final situation. Through some experiments we confirm that our proposed algorithm enables the humanoid robot to start and stop stable walk with variable step length in the desired walking direction according to operator's intentions.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of coordinated path following of multiple wheeled mobile robots while keeping a desired formation. The control laws proposed are categorized into two envelopes, one is steering individual robots to trace along predefined paths, and the other is ensuring tracked paths to be well defined in the formation, by means of decentralized speed adaption.Within this framework, geometric paths following are built on Lyapunov theory and backstepping techniques, while injecting helmsman like behavior into individual path following control. Speed adaption with minimum communication variable under the constraints of multi-robot communication topology, is elaborately designed without relative speeds between neighboring robots requested. The simple but effective controller design, enables multi-robot system to be coordinated and stabilized into an invariant manifold, and all speeds converge to desired profiles in addition. Simulation results illustrate the efficacy of the solution proposed.",

        "abstract": "Robotic teams are often proposed for solving a number of problems, ranging from exploring unknown environments to monitoring areas for security or environmental contamination. These teams are composed of individual robots which may lack the capabilities to complete a task on their own. One critical capability required by teams regardless of the mission is the ability to have sufficient battery life to remain active for the duration of the mission. We present an approach for maintaining battery life by developing a hierarchical team composed of deployable robots and docking stations. Unlike other approaches, the approach presented here focuses on docking stations supporting multiple deployed robots simultaneously. In order to do so the docking stations must continually optimize their locations with respect to the robots in need of service. Discussion of the optimization is presented, along with simulation in multiple environments to illustrate the scalability of the approach to large robotic teams. The on-going transition of this algorithm to actual hardware is also discussed.",

First, a coordination control for combined system of the space robot and the target satellite, which acts as the manipulator payload, is presented so that the robot tracks the optimal path while regulating the attitude of the chase vehicle to a desired value. Subsequently, two optimal trajectories for the pre- and post-capture phases are designed. In the pre-capturing phase, the manipulator maneuvers are optimized by minimizing a cost function which includes the time of travel and the weighted norms of the end-effector velocity and acceleration, subject to the constraint that the robot end-effector and a grapple fixture on the satellite arrive at the rendezvous point with the same velocity. In the post-grasping phase, the manipulator dumps the initial velocity of the tumbling satellite in minimum time subject to the constraint that the magnitude of the torque applied to the satellite remains below a safe value. Simulation and experimental results are appended.",

The inchworm robot prototype features simplest kinematics and open chain architecture. Due to the fact that there is only one attachment module supporting the inchworm robot during crawling, we apply an Unsymmetrical Phase Method (UPM) to realize a stable crawling gait for it. A pine caterpillar robot is derived from combining two inchworm robots together. The crawling gait of it features a repetitive changing chain: Open-Closed-Open. Besides the UPM in open chain states, a four-links kinematic model is applied to control the corresponding joints to transfer the crawling wave along the robot body in the closed chain state. These two prototypes are all constructed and, and their crawling locomotion abilities have been tested on vertical glasses respectively.",

        "abstract": "Miniature Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are quickly gaining acceptance as a platform for performing remote sensing. However, because MAVs are flown close to the ground (300 meters or less in altitude), their field of view for any one image is relatively small. In addition, the context of the video (where and at what orientation are the objects being observed, the relationship between images) is unclear from any one image. To overcome these problems, we propose a geo-referenced mo-saicing method that creates a mosaic from the captured images and geo-references the mosaic using information from the MAV IMU/GPS unit. Our method utilizes bundle adjustment within a constrained optimization framework. Using real MAV video, we have demonstrated our mosaic creation process on over 700 frames. Our method has been shown to produce the high quality mosaics to within 7m using tightly synchronized MAV telemetry data and to within 30m using only GPS information (i.e. no roll and pitch information).",

One possible strategy to address this task is to examine whether the sensor outputs contain information which can be attributed to a common cause. In this paper, we present an approach to localise this embedded common information through an indirect method of estimating mutual information between all signal sources. Ability of L1 regularization to enforce sparseness of the solution is exploited to identify a subset of signals that are related to each other, from among a large number of sensor outputs. As opposed to the conventional L2 regularization, the proposed method leads to faster convergence with much reduced spurious associations. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the findings.",

        "abstract": "DASH, or the Dynamic Autonomous Sprawled Hexapod, is a small, high-power density, minimally actuated robot capable of high-speed running and surviving large falls. The design of DASH has been informed by the study of nature's greatest runners from whom scientists have derived many models for robust high-speed locomotion. DASH is constructed using a scaled Smart Composite Manufacturing (SCM) process which creates rigid cardboard beams with flexible polymer joints that can be folded into complex functional elements. DASH utilizes an alternating tripod gait, and the mechanism by which it creates an alternating tripod gait from a single DC motor is presented. DASH is 10 cm long, has a mass of 16.2 grams, and is capable of running straight at speeds of 1.5 m/s, or 15 body-lengths per second, which is as fast as other similar legged runners in body-lengths per second. Both real time and slow-motion video of high-speed running are shown. A lightweight servomotor can modify the kinematics of DASH so that turning moments are generated. The cardboard beams from which DASH is constructed are rigid in directions which allow for sufficient power transmission for high-speed running. The beams are also flexible but resilient to off-aixs forces and moments which allow DASH to contort and absorb energy under forces not normally seen during running. This property helps to enable DASH survive large falls without damage, including drops from 28 meters onto concrete.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a DSP/FPGA based multi-sensory flexible-joint robot including modular mechanics, hardware and software architecture. The robot is composed of four modular flexible joints and a DLR-HIT-Hand. In each joint there is a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for sensor data processing, brushless DC motor control and communication. The kernel of the hardware system is a PCI-based high speed floating-point Digital Signal Processor (DSP) for the arm/hand Cartesian level control, and FPGA for two high speed (up to 25 Mbps) real-time Serial Buses communication with the arm and hand. All the electronics are integrated into the joint to achieve the high modularity and reliability. Cartesian impedance control and position control with on-line gravity compensation are realized for regulation tasks of the robot with elastic joints. In addition, the experiments of the joint impedance control and Cartesian impedance control demonstrate that the multi-sensors highly integrated robot has a good performance.",

We propose a simple sound database called Pitch-Cluster-Maps(PCMs) based on Vector Quantization approach. Binarized frequency spectrum is used for PCMs codebook generation. It can describe a variety of sound sources, not only voice, from short term sound input. The proposed PCMs sound identification requires several tens(msec) of sound input, and is suitable for a mobile robot application which condition is dynamically changing. We implemented the proposed method on our mobile robot audition system equipped with a 32ch microphone array. Robot noise reduction using proposed PCMs recognition is applied to each input signal of a microphone array. The performance of daily sound recognition for separated sound sources from robot in motion is evaluated.",

        "abstract": "We study a path planning problem which arises when multiple robots are used to gather data from stationary devices with wireless communication capabilities. Each device has a given communication range, and stores a fixed amount of data. The objective of the robots is to gather the data from these devices and to upload it to a base-station/gateway. We introduce a new optimization problem called the Data Gathering Problem (DGP). In DGP, the objective is to compute a tour for each robot in such a way that minimizes the time to collect data from all devices. In order to download the data from a device, a robot must visit a point within the communication range of the device. Then, it spends a fixed amount of time to download the data. Thus, the time to complete a tour depends on not only the travel time but also the time to download the data, and the number of devices visited along the tour. First, we study a special case of DGP where the robots' motion is restricted to a curve which contains the base station at one end. Next, we study the 2D version. We show that two existing algorithms for variants of the Traveling Salesperson Problem can be combined and adapted to obtain a constant factor approximation to DGP. Afterwards, we present an improvement for sparse deployments. We also present simulations which shed light on the utility of data gathering using mobile robots.",

We refer to this idea as data-driven grasping, and we have previously introduced the Columbia Grasp Database for this purpose. In this paper we demonstrate a data-driven grasp planner that requires only partial 3D data of an object in order to grasp it. To achieve this, we introduce a new shape descriptor for partial 3D range data, along with an alignment method that can rigidly register partial 3D models to models that are globally similar but not identical. Our method uses SIFT features of depth images, and encapsulates \u00bfnearby\u00bf views of an object in a compact shape descriptor.",

Each agent is of uncertain dynamics and is affected by other agents in its neighborhood. An agent is able to sense the outputs of the agents inside its neighborhood but is unable to sense those outside its neighborhood. Among all the agents, there is a hidden leader, which knows the desired tracking trajectory, but it is affected by and can only affect those agents inside its neighborhood while all other agents are not aware of its leadership. The decentralized adaptive control is designed for each agent by using the information of its neighbors. Under the proposed decentralized adaptive controls, both rigid mathematical proof and simulation studies are provided to show that all the agents are guaranteed to reach their common goal, i.e., following the desired reference.",

We consider a second-order dynamic model for the object but use a simplified contact model. We seek solutions that require minimal information sharing among the swarm members. We present a velocity control law that is asymptotically stable. In the case of a constant desired velocity, it is shown that no coordination is required between the swarm members. For more complex trajectories we introduce a decentralized feed-forward component that uses an online consensus estimate of the swarm's configuration. The results are illustrated in simulation.",

We model our problem in the Markov decision process framework, which forms a natural way to express concurrent and possibly conflicting objectives - such as reaching a goal quickly, keeping the robot localized, keeping the target in sight - each with their own priority. We show how we can successfully prioritize the different objectives in a flexible way by changing the reward function, based on the sensory needs of the system.",

        "abstract": "Hot air (Montgolfiere) balloons represent a promising vehicle system for possible future exploration of planets and moons with thick atmospheres such as Venus and Titan. To go to a desired location, this vehicle can primarily use the horizontal wind that varies with altitude, with a small help of its own actuation. A main challenge is how to plan such trajectory in a highly nonlinear and time-varying wind field. This paper poses this trajectory planning as a graph search on the space-time grid and addresses its computational aspects. When capturing various time scales involved in the wind field over the duration of long exploration mission, the size of the graph becomes excessively large. We show that the adjacency matrix of the graph is block-triangular, and by exploiting this structure, we decompose the large planning problem into several smaller subproblems, whose memory requirement stays almost constant as the problem size grows. The approach is demonstrated on a global reachability analysis of a possible Titan mission scenario.",

        "abstract": "In order for robots to be able to assist humans at a very close distance, robots should allow contacts occurred at many places and deal with them. For realizing such functions, robots should have whole-body soft sensor exterior for preparing contacts against almost every body parts since it is difficult to limit where to be touched from humans. Although several groups have developed humanoid type robots which have soft tactile sensors, most of them detects distributed 1-axis forces and that is not sufficient when the robot and a human have contacts very closely. In addition to that, there is no consideration in the previous studies about humans' movement during close contact with the robots. In order to solve these problems, we have newly developed a humanoid with soft 3D-deformable sensor flesh and automatic recoverable mechanical overload protection mechanism. Soft 3D-deformable sensors are implemented by molding the infrared light receiving devices into the urethane cube and by detecting the changes of the output voltage of the devices during the deformation. On the other hand, automatic recoverable mechanical overload protection mechanism is implemented by small mechanical torque limiters and monitoring system for embedded potentiometers in the torque limiters. Also detail implementation of the embedded electric system and the overall software structure is described in this paper.",

An optimal configuration of the system is proposed based on the analysis of rigid body dynamics and matrix theory. We also report the results of experimental evaluation. We believe the analysis presented in this paper would benefit the practical design of IMUs in the future.",

In this work, a novel 3 degree of freedom spherical joint is proposed, actuated by tendons that run along the surface of the sphere. The joint is mechanically simple and avoids mechanical singularities. The kinematics and mechanics of the joint are modeled and used to develop both open and closed loop control systems. Simulated and experimental assessment of the joint performance demonstrates that it can be successfully controlled in 3 degrees of freedom. It is expected that the joint will be a useful option in the development of emerging robotic applications, particularly those requiring miniaturization.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposed a new method of designing a flexible biomimetic fish propelled by oscillating flexible pectoral fins. The molding soft body is adopted in the robotic fish. Pneumatic artificial muscles are utilized as driving sources and two ribs with distributed flexibility as main parts of the propulsive mechanism. The leading edge locomotion profile of the flexible pectoral fin in air is studied experimentally, and the flapping locomotion in water is observed too. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by the experiment. It shows that the robotic fish can realize self-driven, and it can swim at a speed of 0.18 m/s~0.20 m/s after optimization.",

Cubic lattices with prismatic transitions simplify many aspects of the hardware and planning control needed for reconfiguration. Despite much research on how cubic modules can coordinate to reconfigure, until now these transitions have not been fully demonstrated in hardware.We describe our movement primitives for both orthogonal and convex corner transitions with prismatic cube modules. We discuss the design of a hardware module capable of performing these transitions, as well as assess the performance of this hardware in an initial demonstration of these transitions.",

For this purpose, a systematic elasto-geometrical modeling method is used to derive the analytical manipulator stiffness models by taking into account their link and joint compliances. The models are then involved within a statistically sensitivity analysis of the influence of the geometric parameters on four global indices that describe the structure stiffness over the workspace. Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm, i.e. Pareto-optimization, is taken as the appropriate framework for the definition and the solution of the addressed multi-objective optimization problem. Our approach is original in the sense that it is systematic and it can be applied to any serial and parallel manipulators for which stiffness is a critical issue.",

In experiments, our method successfully coped with registration failure in 3D mapping in indoor and outdoor environments under various conditions.",

We propose a set of new distinctive image features based on collections of local image gradients grouped by a superpixel segmentation. Features are collected and classified using AdaBoost. The positive classified features then vote for potential hypotheses that are collected using a mean shift mode estimation approach. The presented method overcomes the common limitations of a sliding window approach as well as those of standard voting approaches based on interest points. Extensive tests have been produced on a dataset with more than 20000 images showing the potential of this approach.",

        "abstract": "In situations where generating in internal representation of an object's shape can not be carried out via visual methods, such as in low light conditions or due to a hardware fault, an internal representation of the object must be built from tactile information alone. Existing methods for doing so rely on the availability of a complete force sensitive skin. The work described in this paper shows a method that requires no such equipment and in fact requires no external sensors at all. The method demonstrates that an accurate representation of the object can be built with the accuracy depending on the number of attempts at contacting the object. This internal representation of object can then be used for other tasks such as planning grasps.",

        "abstract": "The non-contact 3D sensing technology, though achieved many success in a variety of applications, needs an automation system to expand its applications to automotive industries for 3D shape inspection. The reason is the difficulty for an operator to find an optimal solution by the manual control of sensor viewpoints. The problem of this industrial application is the capability for the sensing system to simultaneously satisfy all requirements of competence, efficiency, and cost. A robot-aided 3D sensing system can provide such a solution. A CAD-guided robot view planner can automatically generate viewpoints. Measurement accuracy can be satisfied in a certain range. However, the unpredictable image noises still need to be compensated for better measurement performance. In this paper, a feedback planning system is designed and applied to the CAD-guided robot sensor planning system. The feedback controller can automatically evaluate the accuracy of obtained point clouds and generate new viewpoints. This feedback-based inspection system had been successfully implemented in filling holes of a point cloud, caused by shadows and light reflections. Such a system had been implemented on an ABB industrial robot for a 3D measurement of an automotive glass and a pillar. This paper introduces the developed planning system and our current results.",

Our method uses structure from motion techniques from computer vision to obtain the geometric structure of the scene. To achieve an efficient goal-driven resource deployment, we develop an incremental approach, which alternates between an accuracy-driven next best view determination and recursive path planning. The next best view is determined by a novel cost function that quantifies the expected contribution of future viewing configurations. A sensing path for robot motion towards the next best view is then achieved by a cost-driven recursive search of intermediate viewing configurations. We discuss some of the properties of our view cost function in the context of an iterative view planning process and present experimental results on a synthetic environment.",

It is also necessary that the camera nodes be calibrated precisely. In this work, we first develop and evaluate a low power and low cost wireless camera sensor network platform. The camera sensor nodes in this platform transmit a grayscale image over a wireless channel to a master control station. Then we propose a simple, light-weight algorithm to perform distributed calibration of the camera sensor nodes. The camera sensor nodes use their imaging abilities in collaboration with a cooperative moving target to determine their own positions and orientations. The proposed algorithm requires simple arithmetic calculations and hence it can be realized on low power processors. This calibration algorithm has been implemented and evaluated on the developed physical camera sensor network platform.",

The system consists of an IRB1600 industrial robot, a laser tool attached to the robot's end-effector, a portable position-sensitive device (PPD), and a PC based controller. By aiming the laser spot to the center of position-sensitive-detector (PSD) on the PPD with different robot configurations, the developed system ideally implements our proposed calibration method called the virtual line-based single-point constraint approach. However, unlike our previous approach, the calibration method is extended to identify the offset parameters with an uncalibrated laser tool. The position errors of the PPD and the sensitivities of error in the PSD plane to the variation of joint angles are analyzed. Two different robot configuration patterns are compared by implementing the calibration method. Both simulation and real experimental results are consistent with the mathematical analysis. Experimental results with small (10\u22123\u221210\u22122) mean and standard deviation of parameters error verify the effectiveness of both the sensitivity analysis and the developed system.",

In this research, Active Polyhedron can treat virtual three dimensional continuums having many force output points. Active 80-faced Polyhedron can treat virtual objects that are more complex than Active Icosahedron which was previously developed. Towards realizing the overall hardware parts, 120 pieces of new and compact intelligent pneumatic cylinder with length measurement and communication function are designed and constructed. Communication and control system to control input-output data between PC and 120 cylinders was confirmed. Three experiments were carried out, which are position control of the cylinder, shape input experiments and spring motion experiments. In the shape input experiments, inputting shape information of the Active 80-faced Polyhedron to PC is realized. On the other hand, the spring motion experiments establish the stiffness function by changing stiffness coefficient of each intelligent cylinder where the operator can feel its difference. Both experimental results show the effectiveness of the Active Polyhedron for a new human machine interface.",

This study evaluates the degree of freedom realized by forcusing on the range of motion of the joints. Using this method, we evaluated the articular structure of the Wearable Agri-Robot. We investigated the possibility of using it to assist in agricultural work by analyzing the motion required for thie type of work. In this work, we narrowed down the intended operations to the harvesting of Japanese radishes, and validated the effect of the Wearable Agri-Robot on the wearer using myoelectric potential measurement. As a result, it was ascertained that wearing the Wearable Agri-Robot could alleviate the burden on wearer by assisting with agricultural work.",

        "abstract": "The Waseda Flutist Robot is able to play the flute at the level of an intermediate human player. This ability opens a wide field of possibilities to research human-robot musical interaction. This research is focused on enabling the flutist robot to interact more naturally with musical partners in the context of a Jazz band. For this purpose a Musical-Based Interaction System (MbIS) has been proposed to enable the robot to process both visual and aural cues coming throughout the interaction with musicians. In a previous publication, we have concentrated on the implementation of visual communication techniques. We created an interaction interface that enabled the robot to detect instrument gestures of partner musicians during a musical performance. Two computer vision approaches were implemented to create a two-skill-level interface for visual human-robot interaction in a musical context. In this paper we focus on the aural perception system of the robot. The method introduced here enables the robot to, a suitable environment provided, detect the tempo and harmony of a partner musician's play, with a specific focus on improvisation. We achieve this by examining the rhythmical and harmonic characteristics of the recorded sound. We apply the same approach to amplitude and frequency spectrum, thus, in the former case tracking amplitude transients. In the latter case, as we focus on communication with monophonic woodwind instruments, we follow the most prominent peak in the frequency spectrum. We specifically use a similar technique for the audio analysis as we did for our previous research on motion tracking. From the experimental results, we have shown that after implementing our algorithm the robot is able to correctly recognize a number of rhythms and harmonies. It is able to engage in a simple form of stimuli and reaction play with a human musician.",

        "abstract": "It is often difficult for visually impaired persons to walk outside to his or her destination. In this paper, we develop a cane with a built-in haptic interface for use by visually impaired persons. The cane is paired with IC tags buried underground (e.g., under street pavement). The haptic interface is controlled with a position and velocity control system that accurately indicates four directions (forward, backwards, right and left). After evaluating the vibration in the haptic interface, we determined the optimal vibration frequencies indicating a specific direction were combinations of 5 (Hz) and 1 (Hz). Furthermore, the optimal repetition of vibrations was determined to be two times. By using these conditions, the four directions were recognized more than 95% of the time. It was also confirmed that the visually impaired person recognized the presented direction even when an IC tag was buried underground. In the future, a mechanism will be developed that will allow visually impaired persons to recognize directions more accurately even if they swing the cane in a controlled manner. In addition, we will integrate a route decision system into the cane equipped with the haptic interface.",

The system has a direct teaching device, which enables an operator to teach a multi-D.O.F manipulator at comfortable posture despite large changes in the pose of an end-effector. The double-checked safety-related part(SRP/CS) introducing a safety module satisfies the safety performance defined in the international safety standard. To make the teaching easier to perform, impedance parameters in a variable impedance control are set through several direct teaching experiments.

The novel mechanism designing enable the centroid of the robot concentrate on the hip joint to minimize the drive toque of hip joint and keep the robot stable during the single-support phase. And the centroid of the robot will be adjusted to concentrate to the other leg to start a new single-support phase.

        "abstract": "Recently, NOTES (Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery) has attracted attention as a new approach in laparoscopic surgery. This approach achieves extremely less invasive surgery, however, manipulation of forceps is very difficult in NOTES, which brings more burdens on the surgeons. Under these situations, the aim of this study is to develop a micro mobile robot that could move in the abdominal cavity, loaded with a camera and/or forceps. In order to achieve stable movements and surgery support actions, we proposed using peritoneum (abdominal wall) as the surface for moving in the abdominal cavity. Moreover, we devised a robot system that relies on two suckers to attach to the peritoneum, and a cable driven mechanism to realize the relative movement of the two suckers, by which 3 D.O.F. (Degree Of Freedom) movements, i.e., moving forward/backward, turning left/right, and moving up/down could be realized. After examining the suction availability of suckers employed, we built a prototype robot system. We verified that, hanging upside down on the surface of vinyl wall, the robot could accomplish the designated movements with a certain load, which showed potential of using the robot system as the surgery support for NOTES.",

This paper describes the development of a nurse robot to provide automated support to a teleoperated surgical manipulator system in environments where the presence of skilled surgical support staff may not be practical. The tools must be inserted precisely into a compliant manipulator in a timely manner, and the supplies are diverse in nature. To support experimental investigations and evaluations, a seven degrees-of-freedom commercially available manipulator was selected. The design of novel end-effectors, tool grasping and supply holding features, and tool auto-loading systems for optimum surgical tool changing and supply delivery in minimum time is presented. A novel approach for calibration of the nurse robot among compliant and rigid subsystems and for managing forces during subsystem interaction is described and experimental results using this force management approach are presented. Overall experimental performance data for the nurse robot system during tool changing and supply delivery tasks is also presented to illustrate the feasibility of performing these functions in a remote medical or trauma care-assist cell.",

        "abstract": "Although the need for humans and robots to work together in close proximity is increasing, this is currently not allowed with conventional industrial robots for reasons of safety. Next generation robots that can work safely in close proximity with humans must not only be highly functional, but must also be highly reliable with built in safety features. With this aim in mind, we have developed a safety module that integrates safety functions required for robots to work side by side with humans. The safety module is designed to be compliant with international safety standards and Japanese law. Redundant sensory signal processing by an external hardware module and plug-in software installed in the robot controller ensure high-reliability and flexibility. This paper describes the concept and design of the safety module and shows some evaluation results of its safety functions.",

Key features of the design include lightweight construction for low resistance and high energy efficiency in deformable terrain; a passive, articulated chassis for high mobility; and design simplicity for low cost. Deployment in Greenland in spring 2008 over crevasse fields demonstrated the ability of the robot to traverse rough terrain characterized by both firm and soft snow, while gathering data from a ground penetrating radar to detect crevasses. A simple navigation and control algorithm provides low-bandwidth path planning and course correction. Mobility assessment during deployment highlights the need for non-visual means of assessing mobility autonomously. A proprioceptive sensor suite and sample data for autonomous detection of terrain traversability are described.",

        "abstract": "When hyper redundant robots are used in complex and unpredictable environments such as human living space, they should deal with various contact conditions between surrounding objects. Robots thus should plan and optimize not only applying force to the object but also its distribution among contact area. This paper defines the ability to optimize stiffness distribution of a number of contact points as \"Flexibility\" and proposes elastic closed-loop mechanism which has a serial chain of revolute joints with torsion coil springs as a lightweight and supple hyper redundant mechanism. Output stiffness is formulated based on the minimization of potential energy, the balancing of internal force and the velocity constraint to construct a closed-loop mechanism. Joint input to obtain both the desired stiffness distribution and desired output position simultaneously is derived from partial derivative of the output stiffness and compensation by a learning control scheme. Motion control experiments with a 10R elastic closed-loop robot demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.",

        "abstract": "During several decades, the research at Waseda University has been focused on developing anthropomorphic robots able of performing musical instruments. More recently, the authors have succeeded in developing a human-like robot able of playing the alto saxophone. As a result of our research efforts, the Waseda Flutist Robot WF-4RIV and the Waseda Saxophonist Robot WAS-1 have been designed to reproduce the human player performance. Therefore, as a long-term goal, we are proposing to enable the interaction between musical performance robots (i.e. robots orchestra). Such approach may enable us not only to propose new ways of musical expression, but also we may contribute to the better understanding of some of the mechanisms that enable the communication of humans in musical terms. In general terms, the communication of humans within an orchestra is a special case of conventional human social behavior. Rhythm, harmony and timbre of the music played represent the emotional states of the musicians. Of course, we are not considering a musical performance robot (MPR) just as a mere sophisticated MIDI instrument. Instead, its human-like design and the integration of perceptual capabilities may enable to act on its own autonomous initiative based on models which consider its own physical constrains. Due to the complexity of our long-term goal, in this paper, we are presenting our first steps towards enabling the interaction between musical performance robots. In particular, the details of the musical performance control systems are detailed. Thanks to the use of MIDI data, we performed preliminary experiments to enable a duet performance between the WF-4RIV and the WAS-1. We expect in the future; as a result of our research, we may enable a single anthropomorphic robot to perform different kinds of woodwind instruments as well as enable to interact at with level of perceptual capabilities (like human does).",

        "abstract": "In recent years, due to the increasing rate of elderly people in Japan, the needs to detect adults' diseases at the early stage becomes a high priority. In particular, an increased interest in detecting heart and cerebrovascular diseases at an early stage may allow clinicians to begin treatment sooner, when interventions are generally more effective and less expensive. Recently, the Wave Intensity (WI) has been proposed as a new hemodynamic index that provides information about the dynamic behavior of the heart and the vascular system and their interaction. However; the repetitiveness and accuracy of the WI measurement depend on the precision of the positioning of the ultrasound probe. Therefore a positioning device for ultrasound probe is required. Such a device should not only be used to keep the position but also for the fine positioning of the probe. For this purpose, at Waseda University, we have proposed the development of a robot system to assist a carotid blood flow measurement using ultrasound diagnostic equipments. In this paper, the development of Waseda-Tokyo Women's Medical-Aloka Blood Flow Measurement System No. 1 Refined II (WTA-1RII) is detailed. The system consists of an ultrasound diagnostic device, a 6-DOFs parallel link manipulator, a serial link passive arm, ball joint, and a joystick type controller. The WTA-1RII has improved the design of the gravity compensation mechanism. In addition, a genetic algorithm has by implemented to determine the optimal link's position of the 6-DOFs parallel manipulator to increase the workspace. Finally, a set of experiments were carried out to determine the usability of the proposed system.",

Proposed active vision system consists of a noise generator and a neural system. As a noise generator, we use motors with a decentered weight. And as a neural system in order to detect visual signals, we use ensemble of FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons. We first show that our robotic platform can generate several kinds of tremors; tremor around 40 Hz, 50 Hz, and tremor which does not involve specific peak in its power spectrum. And, in order to evaluate the effect of tremor, we prepare clear-films as visual stimuli which move aperiodically in a dark environment. We show that as a result of sensory noise induced by tremor, and as a result of stochastic resonance, neural system successfully detects movements of clear films.",

Various types of algorithms are actually implemented to show that H3 Vision can work a high-speed image processing engine.

In general, the sensor is required to accommodate little space in order to save the room of measuring device. In this paper, a mechanical micro displacement sensor with smaller volume has been proposed. This paper focus on the whole process of this novel sensor from the working principle, parameter determine to the FEM simulation as well as the characteristic experiment and so on. This sensor can enlarge the displacement of the PZT by utilizing the lever principle and the strain gauges can perceive the variation without amplifying the noise. In this sensor, we use the flexure hinges as the rotation joints to obtain the expansion. Whatever the simulation results in FEM or the experiment data, both of which show that the sensor can perceive the displacement of the PZT actuator in micro/nano scale. Also, the characteristic experiment shows that the proposed sensor has a higher level linearity, resolution and lower error.",

Flexible material for the grasper has many advantageous characteristics inherently including robustness against manipulation errors and the ability to increase contact area with a grasped object and the grasping force. Compliance of the grasper material also contributes to reduction in complexity of the processes such as the force control, sensor-motor coordination, and manipulation by self-adaptation. Two properties, flexibility and compliance, mentioned above help the proposed grasper minimize the internal forces in a passive manner and achieve the successful force distribution with self-adaptivity when performing enveloping grasping. In order to demonstrate our work, we have constructed 2 different prototypes of flexible enveloping grasper. Experimental results validate robust performances of the proposed grasper.",

To build robots flexibly and quickly with low costs, we have developed two basic joint modules and several functional modules including grippers, suckers and wheels/feet as end-effectors. In this paper, we introduce the development of these modules, and present several novel robots built using them. Specifically, we show how to use them to set up a manipulator, a 6-DoF biped walking robot, a wheeled mobile robot, a biped tree-climbing robot, and a biped wall-climbing robot. It has been shown that a few modules can easily spawn a variety of novel robots with modular methodology.",

However, the speed of the swelling-deswelling self-oscillation is too slow in order to realize practical chemical robot. In this study, we succeeded in the wide-range control of the period for the swelling-deswelling self-oscillation of a novel polymer gel by selection of the initial concentration of the Belouzov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) substrates and the temperature. The novel polymer gel was composed of a non-thermoresponsive and biocompatible poly-vinylpyrrolidone (PVP) main chain covalently-bonded to the ruthenium catalyst for the BZ reaction. Moreover, we clarified the influence of the initial concentration of the BZ substrates and the temperature on the period and the self-oscillating behavior. By optimizing the initial concentration of the BZ substrates, we cause the swelling-deswelling self-oscillation in 0.5 Hz. The maximum frequency (0.5 Hz) of the novel gel was 20 times higher than that of the conventional-type self-oscillating gel. Moreover, we showed that the displacement of the self-oscillation for the gel has a trade-off relationship against the frequency of the self-oscillation.",

        "abstract": "In our previous study, we first succeeded in construction of a novel-types self-oscillting molecular robot. However, the driving environment of the molecular robot was firmly restricted in strong acid conditions. This is because the molecular robots drive induced by the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction, which is well known for exhibiting temporal and spatiotemporal oscillating phenomena. The overall process of the BZ reaction is the oxidation of an organic substrate, such as malonic acid (MA) or citric acid, by an oxidizing agent (bromate ion) in the presence of a strong acid and a metal catalyst. In this study, in order to drive the novel molecular robot under the physiological condition, we conducted the modification of the molecular structure of the self-oscillating polymer chain. In order to cause the self-oscillation under the biological condition, we synthesized a built-in system where the BZ substrates other than organic acid were incorporated into the molecular robot itself. As a result, the novel molecular robot drives under the biological condition. We believe that the development of the novel molecular robot lead to construction of the novel biomimetic soft robots and actuators, and may inspire novel nonlinear experimental and theoretical considerations.",

In order to achieve this objective, a novel tether mooring type underwater robot was proposed. The robot is moored and its position is controlled by changing the length of the tether. In addition, it can sustain itself with a sea current power generation system. After that, the prototype underwater robot \u00bfAnchor Diver\u00bf was developed. Anchor Diver is moored by one tether, moves using horizontal and vertical rudders and moves upstream by reel mechanism. In addition, the use of a movable anchor and generator as a propeller enables Anchor Diver to enlarge its range of activity.

Souki-II showed high terrain adaptive motion by using the large bore wheels and free caster of the hand. We also showed that the mobility can be enhanced when multiple units are connected together. Souki-II can also take the mode of a manipulator. For the joint mechanism of the Souki-II, we introduced a unit actuator system and a cover member with spiral groove to pass the electric harness and to assist in heat dissipation. From the experiments of the constructed models, we could demonstrate the innovative performance of the proposed Souki-II system.",

For this purpose; in this paper, we are presenting our approach to introduce first year undergraduate students of the Department of Modern Mechanical Engineering the basics of robotics systems. In order to foster the creativity of undergraduate students of engineering fields, we focused in developing an education tool designed to introduce at different educational levels the principle of developing mechatronic systems. In particular, the development of an inverted pendulum mobile robot Waseda Wheeled Vehicle No. 2 (WV-2R) has been proposed. Different kinds of experiments were proposed to confirm the possibility of implementing controllers as well as changing physical properties of the system to observe differences on the response of the system. From the experimental results, we could confirm the effectiveness of the proposed systems to control the angle of pendulum respect to the body base as well as by changing the radius of the wheel.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a method to utilize a port-based multibody contact model for simulating dynamic interaction between irregular surfaces. The existing compliant contact model requires an analytic parametrization of the surfaces involved in the interaction, the definition of a Gauss frame in each of the contact points and initialization of the candidate contact points. The authors intend to apply this contact model for cases in which the surfaces of the 3D interacting bodies can not be described (easily) by a geometrically defined surface. Such surfaces are often represented by 3D point meshes. This implies that the surfaces of the bodies have to be reconstructed from 3D point meshes where initialization of the candidate contact points is not arbitrary. This paper proposes the reconstruction of such surfaces by means of polynomial interpolation. With the aim of having a computationally efficient simulator, the surface interpolation is restricted to small patches around the candidate contact points. To select these candidates, the proposed simulation approach is completed by using a fast (existing) collision detection algorithm. Simulation results are validating the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and simulation approach.",

The proposed strategy deploys a control theoretic bottom-up approach where, continuous controllers are coordinated by a supervisory controlled discrete event system. All the mobile robots are required to navigate in an obstacle populated environment. And the followers keep a predetermined geometric formation with the leader while being adaptable to the constraints imposed by obstacles on the environment. The low level control is achieved by a set of behavior based controller with a high-level discrete event system that manages the dynamic interaction with the external environment. The use of discrete event systems reflects a modular manageable system with the potential for scalability and reusability. The proposed system is implemented through simulation and the results are shown to verify its operation.",

In particular we define a \u201cDiscrete-Time- Motion\u201d model, which from one side represents the environment by means of a potential field, that makes it appropriate to deal with open areas, and on the other hand the motion models for people and robots respond to realistic situations, and for instance human behaviors such as \u201cleaving the group\u201d are considered.",

Due to the distributive nature and unpredictable topology structure of the randomly distributed sensor network, a good tracking algorithm must be able to aggregate large amounts of data from various unknown sources. In this paper, a distributive tracking algorithm is developed using a Markov random field (MRF) model to solve this problem. The Markov random field (MRF) utilizes probability distribution and conditional independency to identify the most relevant data from the less important data. The algorithm converts the randomly distributed network into a regularly distributed topology structure using cliques. This makes tracking in the randomly distributed network topology simple and more predictable. Simulation demonstrate that the algorithm performs well for various sensor field setting, and for various target sizes.",

This paper introduces new designs for JL-2 by which the docking mechanism can be used as a simple gripper with 3 DOFs. Then the technologies of the docking mechanism are discussed in detail, including the workspace of the docking gripper, the docking procedure and analyses of the self-aligning ability. Then the workspaces of the posture adjusting mechanisms between two docked robots are analyzed to clarify the reconfiguration ability of JL-2. At last, a series of real experiments are proposed to test the designs and analyses and the basic performance of JL-2.",

        "abstract": "Mapping the environment is necessary for navigation in unknown areas with autonomous vehicles. In this context, a method to process depth images for occupancy grid mapping is developed. Input data are images with pixel-based distance information and the corresponding camera poses. A measurement model, focusing on stereo-based depth images and their characteristics, is presented. Since an enormous amount of range data must be processed, improvements like image pyramids are used so that the image analysis is possible in real-time. Output is a grid-based image interpretation for sensor fusion, i.e. a world-centric occupancy probability array containing information stored in a single image. Different approaches to draw pixel information into a grid map are presented and discussed in terms of accuracy and performance. As a final result, 3D occupancy grids from aerial image sequences are presented.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Design modifications have improved the durability and performance of a previously developed hybrid vehicle capable of both aerial and terrestrial locomotion. Whereas the original vehicle could fly, land, and crawl in sequence, it suffered from limited durability, as evidenced by catastrophic failure after a small number of landings - two to four depending on the substrate. The two most common failure modes were breakage of the terrestrial locomotion drive servos and separation of components from the fuselage. Evaluation of the original vehicle also identified the need for an autopilot. This further complicated the durability problem by greatly increasing the vehicle's mass, causing larger impulses in high speed landings. The new fuselage design includes a well-defined nacelle to which the propeller motor is securely mounted. All metal DC motors replace R/C servos in the terrestrial drive system, and a slip clutch limits the torque experienced by the motor during landing. The slip clutch comprises an annulus that drives a concentric shaft through three quad profile orings. The new 350 gram vehicle has survived eight landings on different substrates with no sign of damage.",

        "abstract": "Kinematically redundant robotic manipulators (KRRM) can provide a great degree of flexibility for working in complex unstructured environments. Teleoperation control of KRRM requires a strategy to resolve the redundancy of the slave robot while achieving transparency in the task space. In this paper, a two-master control approach is proposed in which the first master transparently controls the redundant slave end-effector in the task space, denoted as the primary task. Meanwhile, a second master exploits the slave redundancy to perform a secondary task such as obstacle avoidance or internal position control. Kinematic redundancy is considered for the slave robot and the traditional autonomous null-space control approach is also accommodated. Teleoperation control is achieved in two steps. First, velocity-level redundancy resolution is attained through new joint-space Lyapunov-based adaptive motion/force controllers. Coordinating reference commands for the joint-space controllers are designed to give priority to the primary task and decoupling between the tasks is achieved without the use of a dynamically consistent pseudo-inverse. Experimental results with two identical planar two-degree-of-freedom master devices controlling a simulated four-degree-of-freedom redundant slave robot show the effectiveness of the approach.",

The governing dynamics equations of the robot moving against water flow as well as gravity in a straight pipe are also derived. Specifically, the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the robot when moving in a live pressurized pipe are taken into account. Two fuzzy-logic based control strategies are adopted. The first one is to maintain a constant translational speed in robot's motion when subjected to flow disturbances that are numerically modeled using step changes in flow velocity within a human-in-the-loop real-time simulation environment, and the second is to steer the real robot inside the pipe while following a numerically modeled time-varying velocity set point with no fluid present in the pipe. The controller parameters were tuned based on data obtained from a human-in-the-loop control system via an artificial neural network.",

Those mechanisms that do address uncertainty either deflect it by soliciting information from others or apply reinforcement learning to select an agent type from within a set. This paper presents a coalition formation mechanism that directly addresses uncertainty while allowing the agent types to fall outside of a known set. The agent types are captured through a novel agent modeling technique that handles uncertainty through a belief-based evaluation mechanism. This technique allows for uncertainty in environmental data, agent type, coalition value, and agent cost. An investigation of both the effects of adding agents on processing time and of model quality on the convergence rate of initial agent models (and thereby coalition quality) is provided. This approach handles uncertainty on a larger scale than previous work and provides a mechanism readily applied to a dynamic collective of real-world robots.",

The proposed method is simple but easily achieves stable grasping of an arbitrary polyhedral object using an arbitrary number of fingers. Firstly, we formulate nonholonomic constraints between a multi-fingered hand-arm system and an object constrained by rolling contact with finger tips, and derive a condition for stable grasping by stability analysis. A new index for evaluating the possibility of stable grasping is proposed and efficient initial relative positions between finger tips and the object for realizing stable grasping are analyzed. The stability of the proposed system and the validity of the index are verified through numerical simulations.",

        "abstract": "Skid-steered vehicles are often used as outdoor mobile robots due to their robust mechanical structure and high maneuverability. Sliding along with rolling is inherent to general curvilinear motion, which makes both kinematic and dynamic modeling difficult. For the purpose of motion planning this paper develops and experimentally verifies dynamic models of a skid-steered wheeled vehicle for general planar (2D) motion and for linear 3D motion. These models are characterized by the coefficient of rolling resistance, the coefficient of friction, and the shear deformation modulus, which have terrain-dependent values. The dynamic models also include motor saturation and motor power limitations, which enable correct prediction of vehicle velocities when traversing hills. It is shown that the closed-loop system that results from inclusion of the dynamics of the (PID) speed controllers for each set of wheels does a much better job than the open loop model of predicting the vehicle linear and angular velocities. Hence, the closed-loop model is recommended for motion planning.",

        "abstract": "An accurate motion model is an important component in modern-day robotic systems, but building such a model for a complex system often requires an appreciable amount of manual effort. In this paper we present a motion model representation, the dynamic Gaussian mixture model (DGMM), that alleviates the need to manually design the form of a motion model, and provides a direct means of incorporating auxiliary sensory data into the model. This representation and its accompanying algorithms are validated experimentally using an 8-legged kinematically complex robot, as well as a standard benchmark dataset. The presented method not only learns the robot's motion model, but also improves the model's accuracy by incorporating information about the terrain surrounding the robot.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel adaptive controller for image-based visual servoing of a small autonomous helicopter to cope with uncalibrated camera parameters and unknown 3-D geometry of the feature points. The controller is based on the backstepping technique but differs from the existing backstepping-based methods because the controller maps the image errors onto the actuator space via a depth-independent interaction matrix to avoid estimation the depth of the feature points. The new design method makes it possible to linearly parameterize the closed-loop dynamics by the unknown camera parameters and coordinates of the feature points in the three dimensional space so that an adaptive algorithm can be developed to estimate the unknown parameters and coordinates on-line. Two potential functions are introduced in the controller to guarantee convergence of the image errors and to avoid trivial solutions of the estimated parameters. The Lyapunov method is used to prove the asymptotic stability of the proposed controller based on the nonlinear dynamics of the helicopter. Simulations have been also conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.",

Omnidirectional vehicles, which can move in any planar direction regardless of their current kinematic pose, inherently have this capability. However, most omnidirectional vehicle designs are not practical for outdoor use because they are based on specialized wheels that can easily become clogged with dirt and debris. This paper presents a dynamic model of an omnidirectional UGV designed to operate in outdoor, real-world environments at sppeds high enough to excite the dynamics of the vehicle. The analysis includes derivation of vehicle's equations of motion and a control strategy using inverse dynamics. Simulation results are shown to validate the model.",

It resolves three problems which have been in the conventional artificial CPG approaches, namely, (1) how to unify it with the standing control, (2) the controller parameter tuning with complicated networked unit oscillators, and (3) a design of an extra sensory feedbacks to be superimposed for stabilization. The proposed control is built upon the stabilizability-maximized COM-ZMP regulator developed by the author, and only a single parameter seamlessly connects it to a stable limit cycle without degrading the stabilization performance. By synchronizing the foot-lifting with a limit cycle of ZMP, a stable periodic alternate stepping is achieved. Since it is free from time-driven trajectory, it is expected to be a fundamental technique to build robust autonomous biped controllers.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The multi-DOF prosthetic hand's myocontrol needs to recognize more hand gestures (or motions) based on myoelectric signals. This paper presents a classification method, which is based on the support vector machine (SVM), to classify 19 different hand gesture modes through electromyographic (EMG) signals acquired from six surface myoelectric electrodes. All hand gestures are based on a 3-DOF configuration, which makes the hand perform like three-fingered. The training performance is very high within each test session, but the cross-session validation is typically low. Acceptable cross-session performance can be achieved by training with more sessions or fewer gesture modes. A fast rhythm muscle contraction is suggested, which can make the training samples more resourceful and improve the prediction accuracy comparing with a relative slow muscle contraction method. For many precise grasp tasks, it is beneficial to the prosthetic hand's myocontrol if we can efficiently extract the grasp force directly from EMG signals. Through grasping a JR3 6 dimension force/torque sensor, the force signal applying to the sensor can be recorded synchronously with myoelectric signals. This paper uses three methods, local weighted projection regression (LWPR), artificial neural network (ANN) and SVM, to find the best regression relationship between these two kinds of signals. It reveals that the SVM method is better than ANN and LWPR, especially in the case of cross-session validation. Also, the performance of grasping force estimation based on specific hand gestures is superior to the performance of grasping with random fingers.",

        "abstract": "EMG-to-force estimation for voluntary muscle contraction has many applications in human-machine interaction, motion analysis, and rehabilitation robotics for prosthetic limbs or exoskeletons. EMG-based model can account for a subject's individual activation patterns to estimate muscle force. For the estimation, so-called Hill-type model has been used in most of the cases. It already has shown its promising performance, but it is still known as a phenomenological model considering only macroscopic physiology. We have already developed the physiological based muscle model for the use of functional electrical stimulation (FES) which can render the myoelectrical property also in microscopic scale. In this paper we discuss EMG-to-force estimation based on this full physiological based muscle model in voluntary contraction. In addition to Hill macroscopic structure, a microscopic physiology originally designed by Huxley is integrated. It has significant meaning to realize the same kind of EMG-to-force estimation with a physiological based model not with a phenomenological model, because it brings the understanding of the internal biophysical dynamics and new insights about neuromuscular activations. Using same EMG data of isometric muscle contraction, the force estimation results are shown by classical approach and new physiological based approach. Its interpretation is also discussed.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an easy and fast method of testing force closure when a multi-fingered hand grasps an object. Different from previous methods, we consider approximating the friction cone by using a few ellipsoids. By using this method, the total force/moment set applied to the grasped object can be obtained by a common set of multiple ellipsoids. This method is effective since we can test the force closure by simply calculating the inequalities of quadratic form. Moreover, by using the ellipsoidal approximation, we propose an easy method of evaluating the grasp stability. We show that the grasp stability can be calculated by using simple equations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by several numerical examples where we show that the proposed method is fairly accurate and can evaluate the grasp stability faster than conventional methods.",

In this paper, we analyze this problem and propose a biologically-inspired computational model that enables the robot to focus on the task-relevant objects. To filter out incompatible task models, we compute a Task Relevance Value (TRV) for each object, which shows a human demonstrator's implicit indication of the relevance to the task. By combining an intentional action representation with \u2018motionese\u2019 [2], our model exhibits recognition capabilities compatible with the way that humans demonstrate. We evaluate the system on demonstrations from five different human subjects, showing its ability to correctly focus on the appropriate objects in these demonstrations.",

We provide a control method for the swarm that adapts easily to changing battlefield conditions, metrics and supervisory algorithms that enable swarm members to economically monitor changes in swarm status as they execute the mission, and display concepts that can efficiently and effectively communicate swarm status to Soldiers in challenging battlefield environments.",

Their heel-strike collision with the ground is generally modeled as an inelastic collision, and the discrete walking dynamics can be specified in the same manner as a rimless wheel by using the energy-loss coefficient and restored mechanical energy. Energy-loss coefficient is especially significant because it controls the gait efficiency and stability, but the value varies significantly according to the swing-leg retraction just prior to impact and robot's mass-distribution. This paper then mathematically investigates how energy-loss coefficient changes with respect to them, and discusses the effect on the gait efficiency and stability.",

This paper is an initial effort to examine efficiency in haptic interaction: We relate physical effort to a performance outcome in a virtual pursuit tracking task. An experimental study is conducted to compare efficiency in a collaborative mutual haptic feedback condition to three control conditions, where participants either acted alone or collaboratively without haptic feedback from the partner. Results show that reciprocal haptic feedback does not improve efficiency, although participants' performance was generally improved when doing the task with a partner, relative to executing it alone. This is due to the greater effort associated with physical connection between partners. However, the effort is more fairly distributed between partners when haptic feedback from the partner is provided. Haptic feedback may be more efficient when the amount of necessary communication between partners increases compared to the task studied here.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the efficiency of a 2-period gait from the kinetic energy view-point. First, we formulate a steady 2-period gait for a compass-like bipedal robot by using a simple recurrence formula for the kinetic energy of an asymmetric rimless wheel. Second, we theoretically show that, in the case that the mean value of the hip angle is constant, the generated 2-period steady gait is less efficient than a 1-period symmetric one in terms of kinetic energy. We also show that the symmetric gait is not always optimal from another viewpoint. We then investigate the validity of the derived method through numerical simulations of virtual passive dynamic walking. Other approaches, delayed feedback control and a quasi-constraint on the impact posture, are also considered for stabilization to a 1-period gait and their effects are discussed.",

The presented approach is characterized through significantly improved robustness of the pose estimation, a novel approach for stereo subpixel accurate landmark initialization, and the speed-up of conventional tracking routines to achieve online capability. Although the algorithm is designed for accurate, online short-range egomotion estimation in hand-held scanning devices, it can be used for any mobile robot application as shown in this paper.

Our approach is suitable for autonomous vehicles navigating in a static environment for which an a priori map of the environment is inaccurate. When the autonomous vehicle detects a new obstacle, our algorithm replans an optimal route without recomputing the entire path. Computational costs when planning paths with level set methods are due to creation of the level set. Once the level set has been computed, the optimal path is simply gradient descent down the level set. Our approach is based on formal analysis of how the level set changes when a new obstacle is detected. We show that in many practical cases, only a small portion of the level set needs to be re-computed when a new obstacle is detected. Simulation examples are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "For a robot with a circular footprint, obstacles in a map can be inflated by the radius of the footprint, and planning can treat the robot as a point robot. Many robotic vehicles however have non-circular footprints. When operating in cluttered spaces it therefore becomes important to evaluate the footprint of these robots against a cost map. This evaluation is one of the major computational burdens in planning for robots whose footprints can not be assumed to be circular. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for evaluating a footprint of the robot against a cost map. Our method involves a transformation of the set of points covered by the footprint of the robot into two sets of points: points that should be evaluated against the cost map with inflated obstacles, and points that should be evaluated against the original cost map. The cumulative number of these points is much smaller than the number of points in the original footprint of the robot. Moreover, the method automatically reduces the robot to a single point when its footprint is circular. On the theoretical side, the paper proves the correctness of our method. On the experimental side, the paper shows that the method results in a significant speedup.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The use of accelerometer and gyro observations in a visual SLAM implementation is beneficial especially in high dynamic situations. The downside of using inertial is that traditionally high prediction rates are required as observations are provided at high sample rates. An accurate orientation and velocity estimate must also be maintained at all times in order to integrate the inertial observations and correct for the effect of gravity. This paper presents a way to pre-integrate the high rate inertial observations without the need for an initial orientation or velocity estimate. This allows for a slower filter prediction rate and use of inertial observations when the initial velocity and attitude of the platform are unknown. Additionally the initial velocity and roll and pitch of the platform become observable over time and an estimate of these values is provided by the filter. An estimate of the gravity vector is also provided. Results are presented using a delayed state information smoother implementation however due to the linearity of the equations this technique can be applied to extended Kalman filter (EKF) implementations just as easily.",

        "abstract": "In the passive dynamic walking proposed by McGeer, mechanical energy lost by heel strike is restored by transporting potential energy to kinetic energy as walking down a slope. When energy input is large such as an angle of slope is steep, bifurcation of walking period occurs. In parametric excitation walking, which is one method to realize passive dynamic-like walking on level ground, bifurcation has also been observed when walking speed is fast. Asano et al. have shown that bifurcation exerts an adverse influence upon walking performance by using rimless wheel model. In this paper, we apply delayed feedback control (DFC) originally used in chaos control to parametric excitation walking to suppress bifurcation. We show in numerical simulation that the proposed method makes two-period walking to one-period walking, and energy efficiency is improved. The analyses using Poincare\u00bf map reveal that the one-period walking with DFC is unstable periodic orbit and that the robot dealt in this paper satisfies the sufficient condition of applicability of DFC.",

In the proposed method the goal is to find all the physically admissible subassemblies in which a set of objects can be disassembled and to identify feasible disassembly motions. Stability of object configurations under the effect of gravity and friction is computed by relying on a physics-based animation engine. We propose efficient strategies to reduce computational time that take into account precedence relations, arising from user assembly demonstrations as well as geometrical clustering. We have also developed a motion planning technique for generating non-destructive disassembly paths on a query-based approach. Experiments have been performed in an interactive virtual environment including a dataglove that allows realistic object manipulation and grasping.",

        "abstract": "Flapping-wing air vehicles can improve efficiency by running at resonance to reduce inertial costs of accelerating and decelerating the wings. For battery-powered, DC motor-driven systems with gears and cranks, the drive torque and velocity is a complicated function of battery voltage. Hence, resonant behavior is not as well defined as for flapping-wing systems with elastic actuators. In this paper, we analyze a resonant drive to reduce average battery power consumption for DC motor-driven flapping-wing robots. We derive a nondimensionalized analysis of the generic class of a motor-driven slider crank, considering motor and battery resistance. This analysis is used to demonstrate the benefits of efficient resonant drive on a 5.8 g flapping-wing robot and experiments showed a 30% average power reduction by integrating a tuned compliant element.",

This paper presents an efficient sampling-based path planner that copes with this issue by considering a reduced search space. The dimension of this space is not fixed but it is iteratively increased according to the difficulty of the task at hand. Initially the search space is 1-dimensional along the line defined by the initial and goal hand configurations (by construction those configurations always belong to the search space), and then its dimension is increased by iteratively adding principal motion directions (that couple the finger motions), trying in this way to produce hand movements through anthropomorphic natural postures.",

This problem is very crucial, especially in humanoid robots, because it tends to have a lot of joints and the motors are located closer to the microphones than the sound sources. In this work, we investigate methods for the prediction and suppression of the ego-motion noise. In the first part, we analyze the performance of different noise subtraction strategies, assuming that the noise prediction problem has been solved. In the second part, we present some results for a noise prediction scheme based on the current robot joint status. Performance is evaluated for a number of criteria, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). We demonstrate that our method improves recognition performance during ego-motion considerably.",

        "abstract": "We propose a model of evolutionary interaction between two robots where signs used for communication emerge through mutual adaptation. Signs used in human interaction, e.g., language, gestures and eye contact change and evolve in form and meaning through repeated use. To create flexible human-like interaction systems, it is necessary to deal with signs as a dynamic property and to construct a framework in which signs emerge from mutual adaptation by agents. Our target is multi-modal interaction using voice and motion between two robots where a voice/motion pattern is used as a sign referring to a motion/voice pattern. To enable evolutionary signs (voice and motion patterns) to be recognized and generated, we utilized a dynamics model: Multiple Timescale Recurrent Neural Network (MTRNN). To enable the robots to interpret signs, we utilized hierarchical neural networks, which transform dynamics model parameters of voice/motion into those of motion/voice. In our experiment, two robots modified their own interpretation of signs constantly through mutual adaptation in interaction where they responded to the other's voice with motion one after the other. As a result of the experiment, we found that the interaction kept evolving through the robots' repeated and alternate miscommunications and re-adaptations, and this induced the emergence of diverse new signs that depended on the robots' body dynamics through the generalization capability of MTRNN.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Humans have unique motion preferences when pursuing a given task. These motion preferences could be expressed as moving in a straight line, following the wall, avoiding sharp turns, avoiding damp surfaces or choosing the shortest path. While it would be very useful for a range of applications to allow robot systems or artificial agents to generate paths with similar specific characteristics, it is generally very difficult to capture and reproduce them from observed information since user trajectories can not be easily generalized. To address this, this paper introduces an approach that modifies a harmonic function path planner to model the user's motion preferences as parameters which could then be used to generate new paths in similar environments without the risk of collisions or incorrect paths. Given a small set of user-specific trajectories and starting from an initial, generic parameter configuration, this approach incrementally minimizes the difference between the direction of the user trajectory segments and the gradient of the parametric harmonic function by modifying its underlying parameters, thus capturing the trajectory preferences. Subsequently, these parameters could be transferred to new, locally similar environments and used to generate new paths. The use of harmonic function parameters to represent the user preferences not only facilitates customization of the path planner but also assures that the customized planner remains complete and correct.",

The total energy of the system is employed to show the passivity property of 2DTORA, and then a simple state feedback control algorithm is developed based on a proper Lyapunov function including energy item.

Many studies have addressed related methods, but fundamental limits to meet required safety have been met owing to the absence of compliance in the robot actuators. Pneumatic muscle is considered to be a basic actuator and offers the advantage of intrinsic elasticity to achieve the joint compliance. Here, the joint compliance actuated by pneumatic muscle is actively utilized to enhance human safety during collisions. To this end, the authors present a novel approach to control compliance and position independently without affecting on the each other's performance using pneumatic muscles. The presented method is verified by experiments using a physical robot.",

In this publication, we show that the problem of entrapping/escorting/patrolling is trivial to define and manage from a cluster space perspective.

This paper proposes a novel segmentation algorithm for extracting a moving target when using a moving platform (that follows a similar trajectory and has a camera that is not calibrated for the particular scene). When the target has unpredictable motions, we are unable to model it and the pertinent backgrounds are very different. We introduce a new entropy-based clustering algorithm in order to find a bounding box representing the target. A target model based on graph representation is used for matching the moving target. To demonstrate the robust target segmentation scheme, we apply the method to a team of miniature robots (the Explorers developed at the University of Minnesota) in real tracking missions.",

A decorrelation improvement of up to 83% can be noticed compare to the standard 3-1-3 Euler angles.

        "abstract": "In this paper it is shown how variation of the kinematic structure of an arm exoskeleton and variation of its fixation pressure on the human limb influences subjectively perceived task performance, such as comfort and the individual indices of the NASA TLX rating scale. It is shown by experimental results that the attachment pressure has a dominant effect on perceived comfort, mental load, physical demand and effort experienced by subjects and is optimal within a range of 10 30 mmHg. Furthermore, it is shown that the inclusion of passive compensatory joints inside an exoelectrons structure can reduce mental demand during a tracking task. When the outcome of this paper is interpreted in combination with a set of objective performance results that were presented earlier , the subjective performance metrics underline the fact that passive compensatory joints paired with an attachment pressure of 20 mmHg increase ergonomics and provide optimal conditions for task performance and comfort.",

It is part of a research project which consists of the development of a robotic leg prosthesis for above knee amputees. This application aims at providing real-time estimates of the prosthesis foot orientation with respect to ground. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used in order to estimate the foot orientation based on gyroscope and infrared measurements. Moreover a constraint equation is also included in the EKF to guarantee the constraints in the estimates. Preliminary tests were performed in a platform built for the prosthesis prototype. The results discussed in this paper reveal the feasibility of such technique.",

This work proposes a sound source number and directions estimation method by using the delay information of microphone array. An eigenstructure-based generalized cross correlation method is proposed to estimate time delay between microphones. Upon obtaining the time delay information, the sound source direction and velocity can be estimated by least square method. In multiple sound source case, the time delay combination among microphones is arranged such that the estimated sound speed value falls within an acceptable range. By accumulating the estimation results of sound source direction and using adaptive K-means++ algorithm, the sound source number and directions can be estimated.",

The feedback controler presented in [1] is enhanced to handle constant disturbances by using online iterative estimation of an equivalent disturbance which is easily compensated by adding the estimated value to the output of the system. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through real-time experiments on an inertia wheel inverted pendulum. Constant disturbances are introduced either as a weight asymmetrically fixed to the pendulum body, or by the use of a bad calibrated sensor.",

        "abstract": "Special attention is paid to the motion of the flexible links in the robotic configuration. The elastic deformation is a dynamic value which depends on the total dynamics of the robot system movements. The Euler-Bernoulli equation (based on the known laws of dynamics) should be supplemented with all the forces that are participating in the formation of the elasticity moment of the considered mode according to the requirements of the motion complexity of elastic robotic systems. This yields the difference in the structure of Euler-Bernoulli equations for each mode. The stiffness matrix is a full matrix as well as damping matrix. Mathematical model of the actuators also comprises coupling between elasticity forces. Particular integral which defined Daniel Bernoulli should be supplemented with the stationary character of elastic deformation of any point of the considered mode, caused by the present forces. General form of the mechanism elastic line is a direct outcome of the system motion dynamics, and cannot be described by one scalar equation but by three equations for position and three equations for orientation of every point on that elastic line. Simulation results are shown for a selected robotic example involving the simultaneous presence of elasticity of the gear and of the link (two modes), as well as the environment force dynamics.",

Artificial audition systems on robots currently exist, but no evaluation of the methods used to localize sound sources has yet been conducted. This paper presents an evaluation of various real-time audio localization algorithms using a medium-sized microphone array which is suitable for applications in robotics. The techniques studied here are implementations and enhancements of steered response power - phase transform beamformers, which represent the most popular methods for time difference of arrival audio localization. In addition, two different grid topologies for implementing source direction search are also compared. Results show that a direction refinement procedure can be used to improve localization accuracy and that more efficient and accurate direction searches can be performed using a uniform triangular element grid rather than the typical rectangular element grid.",

The effects of several parameters related to the MUSIC algorithm on sound source localization and real-time performances were evaluated, for recordings in different environments. Real-time processing could be achieved by reducing the frame size to 4 ms, without degrading the sound localization performance. A method was also proposed for determination of the number of sources, which is an important parameter that influences the performance of the MUSIC algorithm. The proposed method achieved localization accuracies and insertion rates comparable with the case where the ideal number of sources is given.",

However, affective states are typically assessed using offline questionnaires and user reports. In this paper we investigate the use of an online-device for collecting real-time user reports of affective state during interaction with a robot. These reports are compared to both previous survey reports taken after the interaction, and the affective states estimated by an inference system. The aim is to evaluate and characterize the physiological signal-based inference system and determine which factors significantly influence its performance. This analysis will be used in future work, to fine tune the affective estimations by identifying what kind of variations in physiological signals precede or accompany the variations in reported affective states.",

Such a vehicle would be better able to maneuver in tight corridors, avoid obstacles detected at short range, and minimize its time in dangerous situations. This paper presents theoretical analysis and experimental results of a UGV executing extreme dynamic maneuvers by altering its internal mass and inertial properties during locomotion. The behaviors are accomplished by shifting the location of the UGV's center of mass while executing a turn. This modifies the normal force acting on the wheels, which in turn modifies their maximum lateral traction forces.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Neurobiology studies showed that the role of the anterior cingulate cortex of the brain is primarily responsible for avoiding repeated mistakes. According to vigilance threshold, which denotes the tolerance to risks, we can differentiate between a learning mechanism that takes risks, and one that averts risks. The tolerance to risk plays an important role in such learning mechanism. Results have shown the differences in learning capacity between risk-taking and risk avert behaviors. In this paper, we propose a learning mechanism that is able to learn from negative and positive feedback. It is composed of two phases, evaluation and decision-making phase. In the evaluation phase, we use a Kohonen Self Organizing Map technique to represent success and failure. Decision-making is based on an early warning mechanism that enables to avoid repeating past mistakes. Our approach is presented with an implementation on a simulated planar biped robot, controlled by a reflexive low-level neural controller. The learning system adapts the dynamics and range of a hip sensor neuron of the controller in order for the robot to walk on flat or sloped terrain. Results show that success and failure maps can learn better with a threshold that is more tolerant to risk. This gives rise to robustness to the controller even in the presence of slope variations.",

        "abstract": "The capabilities of DLR's multi-DOF humanoid robot Justin are extended with the help of a dynamic torque control component for base reaction minimization. Since the mobile base of the robot comprises springs, reactions induced by arm/torso motions lead to vibrations and deteriorate the performance. The control component is derived from the equation of motion of the robot, represented as an underactuated system, and partitioned into a \u201cdriven\u201d subsystem (one of the arms), and a \u201ccompensating\u201d subsystem (the other arm, with or w/o torso contribution). The control component is then embedded into the existing sophisticated controller structure of Justin, as a feedforward component, with additional control signals from an augmented PD feedback controller. It was possible to obtain satisfactory performance with a very \u201csoft\u201d compensatory subsystem. The experimental results confirmed the potential of this model-based approach for use in a complex multi-DOF system. As far as we know, this is the first time that a dynamic-coupling compensating controller is applied to a real system of such complexity, utilizing thereby a torque control interface.",

The HMR consists of a combination of parallel and serially connected links resulting in a hybrid mechanism that consists of a locomotion platform and a manipulator arm for manipulation, both interchangeable functionally. The new design has the ability to interchangeably provide locomotion and manipulation capability, both simultaneously. This was accomplished by integrating the locomotion mechanism and the manipulator arm mechanism as one entity rather than two separate and attached mechanisms. The manipulator arm can be used as part of the locomotion platform and vice versa. The video demonstrates how this paradigm significantly enhances mobile robot functionality for locomotion and manipulation tasks.",

A 2-DOF parallel mechanism with four actuators is used for verification tests, where the internal torque of the mechanism exists on the two dimensional null space. In the experiment, passive and active stiffness are tested when endowing the external force at the moving platform and compared with the estimated results.",

This form of novel locomotion has the potential to combine the efficiency of a wheeled robot and the mobility of a legged robot. A highly mobile robot such as IMPASS could prove very valuable in applications where the terrain is complex and dangerous, such as search and rescue, reconnaissance, or anti-terror response. This video presents the experiments and findings of a variety of straight-line walking, transitions, and turning gaits. With the 1- 1 and 2-2 straight walking gaits, the robot can move forward stably but with different constraints. Unlike other wheeled vehicles which use Arckerman steering or differential steering, IMPASS can implement novel turning gaits even though the left and right hubs rotate with the same angular velocity. Steady state turning gait is demonstrated with skew transitions. Additionally, a free form gait is demonstrated using joystick control with interesting observations.",

Eface aims at enabling a robot to deliver information clearly with empathetic speech and an expressive virtual face. The empathetic speech is built on the Festival speech synthesis system and provides robots the capability to speak with different voices and emotions. Two versions of a virtual face have been implemented to display the robot's expressions. One with just over 100 polygons has a lower hardware requirement but looks less natural. The other has over 1000 polygons; it looks realistic, but costs more CPU resource and requires better video hardware. The whole system is incorporated into the popular open source robot interface Player, which makes client programs easy to write and debug. Also, it is convenient to use the same system with different robot platforms. We have implemented this system on a physical robot and tested it with a robotic nurse assistant scenario.",

        "abstract": "Algorithms such as Field-D* use linear interpolation to infer continuous fields of costdistance-to-goal, where costdistance is cost integrated over distance. Traditionally, field values have been used as direct input to trajectory planners. In contrast, we focus on extracting a minimum costdistance path between two points, given the continuous field. We identify a suboptimal phenomenon that occurs when standard path extraction techniques are used on linearly interpolated quantity-to-goal fields. The phenomenon causes paths to drift sideways toward their horizontal or vertical bounds, resulting in increased path length and unnecessary turns. We find that the sub-optimality is a mathematical consequence of the linear interpolation used to create the costdistance-to-goal field. We present a possible improvement that calculates path segment directions using an interpolation between the costdistance-to-goal gradient vectors, and perform a series of experiments comparing this method with the current state-of-the-art. We find that the proposed method can achieve a significant reduction in path length error, and we provide discussion and examples of when it should and should not be used.",

        "abstract": "First task robots have to realise is sensing and acting in the environment. Can a robot learn the way it is able to sense and act in the world without any hardwired notions? Is it able to learn it from the only data he has access to, that is high-dimension sensory inputs and motor outputs? This paper presents experimental results obtained on a simulated human listener using a bio-inspired model of the cochlea and real records from human related transfer functions (HRTF). These results show that a naive system that interacts with its environment without knowing the laws governing these interactions can discover information about dimensionality of space. Moreover, the laws determining the sensations of the system as a function of the state of the system and the environment, called the \u00bfsensorimotor law\u00bf, are not simplified as usually in simulations. They are bio-realistic as they are determined by the HRTF recorded on human beings.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a new approach to extract planar features from 3D range data captured by a range imaging sensor-the SwissRanger SR-3000. The focus of this work is to segment vertical and horizontal planes from range images of indoor environments. The method first enhances a range image by using the surface normal information. It then partitions the Normal Enhanced Range Images (NERI) into a number of segments using the Normalized-Cuts (N-Cuts) algorithm. A least-square plane is fit to each segment and the fitting error is used to determine if the segment is planar or not. From the resulting planar segments, each vertical or horizontal segment is labeled based on the normal of its least-square plane. A pair of vertical or horizontal segments is merged if they are neighbors. Through this region growing process, the vertical and horizontal planes are extracted from the range data. The proposed method has a myriad of applications in navigating mobile robots in indoor environments.",

In situations where these large discrepancies exist, the search may expend significant effort escaping from the \u00bfbowl\u00bf of a local minimum. A* typically computes supporting data structures for the heuristic once, prior to initiating the search. FAHR directs the search out of the bowl by recomputing parts of the heuristic function opportunistically as the search space is explored. FAHR may be used when the heuristic function is in the form of a pattern database. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm through experiments on a ground vehicle path planning simulation.",

Although one of the simplest alternatives to apply FES for reducing the effects of tremor, the contribution of different co- contraction levels for joint motion and impedance must be accurately estimated, specially since tremor itself is highly time-varying. In this work, a detailed musculoskeletalmodel of the human wrist actuated by flexor and extensor muscles is used for this purpose. The model takes into account different properties that affect muscle dynamics, such as proprioceptive feed- back and combined natural and artificial activation. The model, analysis of stiffness modulation due to FES-controlled co-contraction and simulation results are presented in the paper.",

The approach has advantages in terms of robustness, speed and storage as compared to the voxel based approaches. Unlike previous approaches, the uncertainty in plane parameters is utilized to compute the uncertainty in the pose computed by scan-registration.

        "abstract": "Man-made real-world environments are dominated by planar surfaces many of which constitute behavior-relevant entities. Thus, the ability to perceive planar surfaces is vital for any embodied system operating in such environments, be it human or robotic. In this paper, we present an architecture for detection and estimation of planar surfaces in the scene from calibrated stereo images. They are represented in a behavior-oriented way, focusing on geometrical properties that are relevant for enabling basic interaction between a robot and the planar surfaces it perceives. Ego-motion of the robot is compensated for by transforming the representations into a global coordinate system using the kinematics of the robot. Our architecture is able to detect and estimate arbitrary planar surfaces, regardless of their visual appearance, their geometrical properties other than planarity and their being static or arbitrarily moving. The latter is achieved by processing each frame independently of the others. Stable representations are obtained by establishing spatio-temporal coherence between the single-frame representations of subsequent frames. Based on a RANSAC approach to plane fitting, our method is robust to unreliable 3D data such as obtained by local stereo correlation, for example. In our experiments using the Honda humanoid robot ASIMO, we show that our method is able to provide a robot in real-time with representations of planar surfaces in its environment that are sufficiently accurate for basic interaction.",

To build informative and robust 3D feature point representations, our descriptors encode the underlying surface geometry around a point p using multi-value histograms. This highly dimensional feature space copes well with noisy sensor data and is not dependent on pose or sampling density. By defining classes of 3D geometric surfaces and making use of contextual information using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), our system is able to successfully segment and label 3D point clouds, based on the type of surfaces the points are lying on. We validate and demonstrate the method's efficiency by comparing it against similar initiatives as well as present results for table setting datasets acquired in indoor environments.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a new algorithm for relative pose estimation between two images based on a new decomposition for an homography matrix faster than the classical solutions. We introduce in our method approximate information about the planes in the reference images but this additional information allows the decomposition to avoid the multiplicity of solutions. An exhaustive analysis of the error propagation through the method is provided. The new decomposition can be used for visual navigation of robots moving on a planar surface. The approach is based in the well known teaching-by-doing scheme with the route defined by a set of images. The parameters of the planes can be computed automatically from the reference images before the navigation. The contributions are the easy method to extract the parameters of all the planes and the use of this information in navigation tasks using a fast homography decomposition. The experimental results show the performance of the proposal.",

Shadows misclassified as objects create problems in autonomous driving applications. Real-time efficient algorithms in dynamic background settings are proposed. Without the static background assumption, which was often used in previous work to develop fast algorithms, our scheme estimates the varying background efficiently. A combination of various features classifies each pixel into one of the following categories: road, shadow, dark object, or other objects. In addition to pixel level classification, spatial context is also used to identify the shadows. Our results show that our methods perform well for autonomous driving applications and are fast enough to work in real time.",

To be effective and practical, the control architecture must be able to transition a group of robots from an initial swarm to a final formation. It must then be able to handle real-world events that could disrupt the formation, thus, requiring formation repair, obstacle avoidance, and changes in the formation. In previous work, we presented a distributed, reactive cellular automata-based formation control architecture capable of controlling any number of robots in formation at once. In this paper, we examine our architecture with respect to necessary characteristics to handle real-world occurrences. To address issues of formation repair and obstacle avoidance, the control architecture is extended by a distributed auctioning method that allows the robot formation to reconfigure autonomously.",

        "abstract": "One of the prerequisite conditions for making a successful manipulation is that the relative position between the AFM tip and the objects can be sensed and controlled accurately. While this prerequisite is grandly hampered by the PZT nonlinearity and thermal drift. Although the PZT nonlinearity can be compensated to a certain extent through mounting a position sensor on the PZT scanner, this method leads to a higher system noise and a higher cost. In addition, this method can not handle the positioning error caused by thermal drift due to the lack of sensing ability to the displacement between the AFM tip and the sample stage. This paper propose a newly developed strategy to solve these problems. Its pivotal idea is the tip position is localized based on the sensing information to sample features, not PZT driving voltage or sensor signal. In this way, the positioning error aroused from PZT nonlinearity and thermal drift can be effectively suppressed. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage and effectiveness of the proposed method.",

We developed a networked robot system that coordinates multiple social robots and sensors to provide efficient service to customers. It directs the tasks of robots based on their positions and people's walking behavior, manages the paths of robots, and coordinates the conversation-performance between two robots. Laser range finders were distributed in the environment to estimate people's positions. The system estimates such human walking behaviors as \u201cstopping\u201d or \u201cidle walking\u201d to direct robots to provide appropriate tasks to appropriate people. Each robot interacts with people to provide recommendation information and route information about shops. The system sometimes simultaneously uses two robots to lead people from one place to another. The field trial, which was conducted in a shopping mall where four robots interacted with 414 people, revealed the effectiveness of the network robot system for guiding people around a shopping mall as well as increasing their interest.",

        "abstract": "We present a method to detect human fingertips from images captured by a stereo camera. The system makes use of the disparity information from a stereo camera to find candidates, and defines an evaluation process to detect two hands. The finger detector then processes each hand image to extract finger images. Finally, we perform geometric calculations on the results to relocate the positions of the fingertips. The proposed method is not complex; however, it shows exciting results in terms of run time and detection rates. The extraction result can be used in hand configuration modeling for gesture recognition in HCI systems.",

A subset of the total distributed process integration is assumed to be handled by flexible routing operations. Physical routing operations are considered to be facilitated by autonomous mobile Payload Routing Platforms (PRP's). Facility layout flexibility is extended through active material routing operations. A prototype mobile PRP is presented, which has been developed for preliminary testing and validation of the motion control associated with providing distributed process integration under customer-induced production dynamics.",

The method is composed of a fast iterative object surface reconstruction algorithm and of a local grasp planner, evolving in a synchronized parallel way. The reconstruction algorithm makes use of images taken by a camera carried by the robot. A reconstruction sphere, virtually placed around the object, is iteratively compressed towards the object visual hull, dragging out the fingers attached to it. Between two steps of the reconstruction process, the planner moves the fingers, floating on the current reconstructed surface, according to suitable quality measures. The fingers keep moving until a local minimum is achieved, then a new object surface estimation provided by the reconstruction process is considered. Quality measures considering both hand and grasp proprieties are adopted. Simulations are presented to show the performance of the proposed algorithm.",

The development of compact, lightweight automated tools for needle insertion with the reliability of an expert needle-inserting nurse could significantly reduce the risk to both civilian and military patients. Such tools could open the door to many advanced concepts for future medicine by being an \u00bfenabler\u00bf of one of the first actions in almost all procedures. The purpose of this paper is to discuss two force-based devices that address the needle insertion problem: a compliance-sensing system that mimics the nurse palpation to determine the best needle insertion point across a vein, and a needle insertion device that uses force-based profiles during insertion to achieve successful catheterization without puncturing the vein back wall. The methodologies and implementation approaches for the two enabling systems are described. Experimental data obtained with training pads and phantom arms are presented and discussed.",

A hierarchical fuzzy controller, which has the ability to deal with the rule explosion problem, is proposed in this paper. After a brief introduction of the architecture of the closed-loop control system for the cable-driven auto-leveling parallel robot, the construction of the hierarchical fuzzy controller is set up, in which the force offsets of the four cables and the angle deviations of the two diagonal inclinations are chosen as input variables, and the output variables are the position changes of the four linear motion units. The hierarchical fuzzy controller contains two layers - the low level layer which generates two outputs for leveling adjustment and force tuning, and the high level layer which is used to coordinate the two outputs from the low level layer. Experimental results have demonstrated that the hierarchical fuzzy controller can achieve the control objectives with high regulation accuracy and short adjusting time, and can be easily applied to practical systems.",

The rule bases for the FLCs are functions of the linearized model's inputs, the Boeing 747's vertical velocity and altitude. The crisp FLC outputs, as determined by the centroid method, are the elevator and throttle deflections. Different types of membership functions are tested with the FLCs to determine the efficacy of the tested membership types for the given application for landing an aircraft. Future work will involve comparing the FLCs to more conventional controllers.",

Additionally, the novel control system enables permanent full speed flight with reliable altitude keeping considering that the resulting lift is decreasing while changing pitch or roll angles for position control. In the following chapters the control procedure for position control and waypoint navigation is described. The dynamic behavior was simulated by means of Matlab/Simulink and results are shown.

However, the model is extended to consider that in one gait cycle some legs are in contact with the ground and others are not. In order to obtain the inverse kinematics model, this paper presents as contribution the use of the extended Kalman filter as optimizer in two different situations of the leg motion: unconstrained case, for the swing leg(s), and constrained case, for the leg(s) in contact with the ground. This method was evaluated for locomotion in plain and inclined surfaces. The results obtained with the kinematics model were satisfactory when implemented in a point-to-point trajectory in simulation, and also in an experiment with a four-legged platform with three degrees of freedom in each leg.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we aim to study and classify gait patterns among flat walking, descending stairs, and ascending stairs using inertial measurement unit (IMU) including triaxial accelerometers and gyroscopes. Six subjects were invited to gather gait data of flat walking, descending stairs, and ascending stairs wearing the shoe-integrated system with free speeds. The design of the classifier for identifying gait patterns based on continuous kinematic signals is composed of three steps. In the first step, we separate gait signals of the six sensors in the same period into gait segments which are further used as the units for pattern feature analysis. Secondly, based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the average sum of squares of wavelet coefficients of each segment for anteroposterior acceleration, vertical acceleration, and sagittal plane angular rate are demonstrated and selected as the common features for gait pattern classification. At the last step, the fuzzy logic based classifier is proposed according to the distribution of the common features of different gait patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed methodology is efficient for classifying gait patterns during humans' daily activity.",

Stable trajectories are generated during the optimization process, considering a stable trajectory generator based on the Zero Moment Point criterion and the inverse dynamic model. Additionally, two neural network (NN) are used to decrease the time-consuming computation of the model and ZMP optimization. The first neural network approximates the inverse dynamics and the ZMP optimization, while the second one works in the optimization procedure, giving the adapting parameter according to orthosis-patient interaction. Also, a robust controller based on the \u00bf\u00bf method is designed to attenuate the effects of external disturbances and parametric uncertainties in the trajectory tracking errors. The dynamic model of the actual exoskeleton, with interaction forces included, is used to generate simulation results.",

In this paper, we address this complexity by introducing two algorithms. Annealed chain fitting efficiently maps a continuous backbone curve to a set of joint angles for a snake robot. Keyframe wave extraction takes joint angles fit to a sequence of backbone curves, and identifies parameterized periodic functions which produce those sequences. Together, they allow a designer to conceive a gait in terms three-dimensional shapes and translate them into easily manipulated wave functions. We validate the algorithms by using them to produce rolling gaits for crawling and climbing.",

An advantage of the control method is to work well without using exact parameter values of the controlled systems nor huge numerical calculations. This paper discusses how to apply the proposed control method to walking motions as a first step to realize energy saving biped robots. For this purpose, we consider some dynamics of the biped robots. Simulation results showed that the proposed control method can generate energy saving walking motions.",

The GSMC controller is designed with the consideration of all uncertainty bounds. In the controller implementation, a high-gain velocity observer is adopted to estimate the feedback velocity from the measured position. The effectiveness of the GSMC over ordinary SMC and traditional PID control is demonstrated through simulations, while the variations of design parameters on control performances are examined as well. Results show that the GSMC can reduce the hysteresis to a negligible level and lead to a sub-micron accuracy tracking with tolerance to some degrees of external disturbances, which provides a sound base of practical control of the micropositioning system for micro/nano scale manipulation.",

        "abstract": "The majority of work related to grasp planning has centered on the understanding of what constitutes a good grasp. However, to reach a good grasp we must first find the relative position of the gripper, its approach vector, and finger configuration. This search problem is the focus of our paper. We propose an on-line method that uses pairwise shape descriptors to quickly find good alignments between the gripper contact surface and the target. Having found a good fit, we then evaluate how alignment quality relates to grasp quality and what can be done to speed up the exploration of the DOF space.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose LDA-based framework for multimodal categorization and words grounding for robots. The robot uses its physical embodiment to grasp and observe an object from various view points as well as listen to the sound during the observing period. This multimodal information is used for categorizing and forming multimodal concepts. At the same time, the words acquired during the observing period are connected to the related concepts using multimodal LDA. We also provide a relevance measure that encodes the degree of connection between words and modalities. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a robot platform and some experiments are carried out to evaluate the algorithm. We also demonstrate a simple conversation between a user and the robot based on the learned model.",

The nature of the impaired hand can be summarized in a limited extension, abduction and adduction leaving the fingers in a flexed position, so the exoskeleton goal is to train a safe extension motion from the typical closed position of the impaired hand. The mechanical design of HANDEXOS offers the possibility to overcome the exoskeleton limits often related to the general high level of complexity of the structure, mechanism and actuation. We describe the mechanical design of the index finger module, the dynamic model and some preliminary experimental results.",

        "abstract": "A haptic device using flexible sheet and air jet is proposed. This device presents haptic sensation of virtual lumps under skin to user's finger. A tensioned flexible sheet is regarded as virtual skin. A user touches the sheet directly with his finger. Then he feels the softness of normal skin as the sheet compliance. A nozzle fires thin beam of air jet to the sheet from its back, when the user touches the sheet at the location of a virtual lump. The fingertip feels the small hard part made by the air jet through the sheet. This can be the virtual lump. In order to present multiple virtual lumps, the nozzle is attached to a manipulator. A camera measures the fingertip motion, and the manipulator moves the nozzle together with the fingertip. The nozzle fires the air jet when the fingertip is on the virtual lumps. We can vary the hardness of a virtual lump by controlling the flow rate of air. We can also vary the size of the virtual lump by controlling the distance between the nozzle and the sheet; the shorter distance makes the virtual lump smaller. This is because the air jet radiates out from the nozzle. Some experiments of presenting multiple virtual lumps and varying the hardness and size of a virtual lump are performed.",

        "abstract": "High frequency contact accelerations convey important information that the vast majority of haptic interfaces cannot render. Building on prior work, we present an approach to haptic interface design that uses a dedicated linear voice coil actuator and a dynamic system model to allow the user to feel these signals. This approach was tested through use in a bilateral teleoperation experiment where a user explored three textured surfaces under three different acceleration control architectures: none, constant gain, and dynamic compensation. The controllers that use the dedicated actuator vastly outperform traditional position-position control at conveying realistic contact accelerations. Analysis of root mean square error, linear regression, and discrete Fourier transforms of the acceleration data also indicate a slight performance benefit for dynamic compensation over constant gain.",

It includes an approach for the reconstruction and prediction of heart surface motion based on a novel physical model of the intervention area described by a distributed-parameter system. Instead of conventional element methods, a meshless method is used for a spatial and temporal decomposition of this system. This leads to a finite-dimensional state-space form. Furthermore, the state of the resulting lumped-parameter system, which provides an approximation of the deflection and velocity of the heart surface, is dynamically estimated under consideration of uncertainties both occurring in the system and arising from noisy camera measurements. By using the estimation results, an accurate reconstruction of heart surface motion for the synchronisation of the surgical instruments is also achieved at occluded or non-measurement points.",

Due to these languages, the development of robotic software is a complex and expensive task requiring technical expertise and time. Hence, the use of industrial robots is often not a question of technical feasibility but of economic efficiency. This paper introduces a new architectural approach making available modern concepts of software engineering for industrial robots. The core idea is to hide the real-time critical robot control from application developers. Instead, common functionality is provided by a generic and extensible application programming interface and can be easily used. Hence, this approach can lead to an industrialization of software development for industrial robotics.",

A vocabulary of visual words is built automatically, representing local features that repeatedly occur in the set of training images. An information maximization technique is then applied to build a hierarchical classifier for each environment by learning informative visual words. Child nodes in this hierarchy encode information redundant with information coded by their parents. In localization, hierarchical classifiers are used in a top-down manner, where top-level visual words are examined first, and for each top-level visual word which does not respond as expected, its lower-level visual words are examined. This allows inference to recover from missing features encoded by higher-level visual words. Several experiments on a challenging localization database demonstrate the advantages of our hierarchical framework and show a significant improvement over the traditional bag-of-features approaches.",

In addition to identification and integration of the complementary communication components, this paper's contribution is in demonstrating how discretization, approximation and batch pre-calculation allow the complete model to remain practicable for real-time robot simulation.

Its speed is faster than an A* planner in maps in which the obstacle rate is the same as indoor environments. Precomputed search trees are one way of reducing planning time; however, there is a time-memory trade off. Our precomputed search tree (PCS) is built with pruning based on a rule of constant memory, the maximum size pruning method (MSP) which is a preset ratio of pruning. Using MSP, we get a large precomputed search tree which is a reasonable size. Additionally, we apply the node selection strategy (NSS) to MSP. We extend the outer edge of the tree and enhance the path reachability. In maps less than 30% obstacle rates on a map, the runtime of precomputation planning is more than one order of magnitude faster than the planning without precomputed search trees. Our precomputed tree finds an optimal path in maps with 25% obstacle rates. Then our precomputation planning speedily produces the optimal path in indoor environments.",

The robot is very compact and light weight compared to other rescue robots. It has eight D.O.F. in total, four of which are for crawlers and the others are for shifting the shape of the robot. We confirmed that the proposed robot can get over 36 cm high-step one-and-a-half times as high as its original height.

        "abstract": "We present a two-step iterative algorithm to estimate the trajectory of a hopping rover. In the first step, a monocular scheme of visual odometry is adapted to estimate an initial portion the hopping trajectory. From this, the parameters for the ballistic motion are recovered, and the trajectory is extrapolated to predict the positions of the rover for the remainder of the hop. In the second step, we devise a scheme called \u00bfselective vision\u00bf, combining the ideas of active vision and guided search. An envelope lying between the start and end of a hop is defined, within which features most likely to be re-observed across a hop are detected and matched. Performing pose estimation on the these matched features allow the relative motion between a camera frame within the visual odometry step and a camera frame within the extrapolated trajectory to be estimated. The newly determined camera frame in the extrapolated trajectory can then be used to refine the parameters of the ballistic motion, and the trajectory can be re-extrapolated to predict future positions of the hopping rover. Following this scheme, it is possible to estimate the trajectory of a hopping rover undergoing continuous rotational motion with only one set of cameras without continuous tracking of terrain features.",

        "abstract": "Hopping sensors are a type of low cost mobile sensors that are small in size, have limited capability and imprecise movement. However, their unique method of movement makes them suitable for rugged terrains. Sensors may fail when deployed in a rugged terrain or in an obstacle-abundant environment. Therefore, redundant sensors may be identified and relocated to the sensor holes. This paper addresses the problem of relocating such capability-constrained sensors in an obstructive environment. We propose an enhanced quorum-grid solution with binary splitting message forwarding (BSMF), which is decentralized and can detect both existing and newly appearing obstructions in the supplier and consumer cells matching process. Furthermore, a grid-based movement model is introduced for the hopping sensors. Simulation shows that our scheme significantly reduces the communication overhead and achieves relatively constant total energy consumption with varying amount of obstructions.",

        "abstract": "Human movement analysis through vision sensing systems is an important subject regarding Human-Robot interaction. This is a growing area of research, with wide range of applications fields. The ability to recognize human actions using passive sensing modalities, is a decisive factor for machine interaction. In mobile platforms, image processing is regarded as a problem, due to constant changes. We propose an approach, based on Horopter technique, to extract Regions Of Interest (ROI) delimiting human contours. This fact will allow tracking algorithms to provide faster and accurate responses to human feature extraction. The key features are head and both hand positions, that will be tracked within image context. Posterior to feature acquisition, they will be contextualized within a technique, Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) and will be used to provide sets of classifiers. The implementation of the LMA technique will be based on Bayesian Networks. We will use these Bayesian classifiers to label/classify human emotion within the context of expressive movements. Compared to full image tracking, results improved with the implemented approach, the horopter and consequently so did classification results.",

Through user's help, a robot with a stereo camera can investigate the environment without failure and even more efficiently. Moreover, the user can share the information about the environment with the robot and add semantic information to the environmental map. We employ PCA features for visual landmarks and a hybrid map for map representation. Particularly, we define two types of nodes, U/R-nodes and divide the map building into three processes, User's Guidance, Robot's Map Revision, and Robot's Map Completion. We implemented a human augmented mapping system with a stereo camera and demonstrated it in rectangular-shaped corridors. From the comparison with a manually-built map, we showed the feasibility of the environmental map generated by our proposed method.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an under-actuated model of human walking, comprising only a soleus muscle and flexion/extension monoarticular hip muscles. The remaining muscle groups of the human leg are modeled using quasi-passive, series-elastic clutch elements. We hypothesize that series-elastic clutch units spanning the knee joint in a musculoskeletal arrangement can capture the dominant mechanical behaviors of the human knee in level-ground walking. As an evaluation of the musculoskeletal model, we vary model parameters, or spring constants, and muscle control parameters using an optimization scheme that maximizes walking distance and minimizes the mechanical economy of walking. We used a positive force feedback reflex control for the model's soleus muscle, and upper body position control for the hip muscles. The model's clutches were engaged/disengaged using simple state machine controllers. For model evaluation, a forward dynamics simulation was conducted, and the resulting mechanics were compared to human walking data. The model makes qualitative predictions of joint mechanics, electromyography and mechanical economy.",

Human collaborative design aims to optimize the system design for the advantage of collaboration between human and robots based on human considerations. Task modeling approach is developed to study and analyze the task in order to identify the collaboration tasks to develop the collaboration planning. In the collaboration safety development, five safety designs, cover both hardware and control design, are proposed and developed in the prototype system. Risk assessment is conducted to verify the safety design. Two main experiments were conducted as preliminary study to investigate mental workload in HRC. A multimodal information support system is developed in the study of man-machine interface in this work to provide a comprehensive human-robot interface to facilitate human operator. The system performance evaluation had proven the improvement of prototype production cell with HRC design for cellular manufacturing.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present efficient solutions for planning motions of dual-arm manipulation and re-grasping tasks. Motion planning for such tasks on humanoid robots with a high number of degrees of freedom (DoF) requires computationally efficient approaches to determine the robot's full joint configuration at a given grasping position, i.e. solving the Inverse Kinematics (IK) problem for one or both hands of the robot. In this context, we investigate solving the inverse kinematics problem and motion planning for dual-arm manipulation and re-grasping tasks by combining a gradient-descent approach in the robot's pre-computed reachability space with random sampling of free parameters. This strategy provides feasible IK solutions at a low computation cost without resorting to iterative methods which could be trapped by joint-limits. We apply this strategy to dual-arm motion planning tasks in which the robot is holding an object with one hand in order to generate whole-body robot configurations suitable for grasping the object with both hands. In addition, we present two probabilistically complete RRT-based motion planning algorithms (J+-RRT and IK-RRT) that interleave the search for an IK solution with the search for a collision-free trajectory and the extension of these planners to solving re-grasping problems. The capabilities of combining IK methods and planners are shown both in simulation and on the humanoid robot ARMAR-III performing dual-arm tasks in a kitchen environment.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of door-opening by using modular reconfigurable robot (MRR). Based on multiple working mode control of the joint modules of the MRR, we first propose an online mode-switch strategy for all joint modules so that each joint module can be easily determined when it should be switched between active working mode and passive working mode during the door-opening process. Based on the proposed mode-switch strategy, a hybrid control scheme is proposed for door-opening. Simulation results are used to demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed mode-switch strategy and the hybrid control scheme.",

Here, we show that the same magnetic nanoparticles can also be exploited to perform various functions including but not limited to hyperthermic drug release actuators. Specifically, we synthesized vascular microrobots by embedding MNP in N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPA) thermo responsive hydrogel. We experimentally demonstrate the decrease in volume of the hydrogel microrobot in response to AC magnetic heating, a property that allows microrobots to adapt to blood vessels of various diameters. This type of hydrogel is not only able to reduce size in response to temperature elevations but it can also be used to release possible therapeutic agents previously trapped within the hydrogel. Here, NIPA hydrogel samples were placed inside an AC magnetic field of 116 Oe at 145 kHz. Temperature elevations as well as change in hydrogel volume were recorded.",

We survey an integrated approach to human-robot interaction that has been developed supported by the testbed under an European research project.

This paper describes the method to identify the model parameters of a small linear drive with ball-screw. Two kinds of friction models will be applied for the servomechanism looking to rise its micro-positioning abilities. The first one includes the static, viscous and Stribeck friction with hysteresis, and the second one uses the Lugre model. The results will be compared taking into account the criterion error, the accuracy and the normalized mean-square-error of the identified mechanical parameters. The coefficients of the models are identified by a recursive identification method using data acquisition and special filtering technics. The least square identification method is used in this paper in order to establish the motor parameters used as initial condition of the recursive estimation method. Computer simulations and experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model.",

        "abstract": "For robotic assisted minimally invasive surgery, recovering the 3D soft-tissue shape and morphology in vivo is important for providing image-guidance, motion compensation and applying dynamic active constraints. In this paper, we propose a practical method for calibrating the illumination source position in monocular and stereoscopic laparoscopes. The method relies on using the geometric constraints from specular reflections obtained during the laparoscope camera calibration process. By estimating the light source position, the method forgoes the common assumption of coincidence with the camera centre and can be used to obtain constraints on the normal of the surface geometry during surgery from specularities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with numerical simulations and by qualitative analysis of real stereo-laparoscopic calibrations.",

        "abstract": "Most existing approaches to indoor localization focus on using either cameras or laser scanners as the primary sensor for pose estimation. In scan matching based localization, finding scan point correspondences across scans is challenging as individual scan points lack unique attributes. In camera based localization, one has to deal with images with few or no visual features as well as scale factor ambiguities to recover absolute distances. In this paper, we develop multimodal approaches for two indoor localization problems by fusing a camera and laser scanners in order to alleviate the drawbacks of each individual modality. For our first problem we recover 3 degrees of freedom (DoF) of a camera-laser rig on a rolling cart in a 2D plane, by using visual odometry to facilitate scan correspondence estimation. We demonstrate this approach to result in a 0.3% loop closure error for a 60 m loop around the interior corridor of a building. In our second problem, we recover 6 DoF of a human operator carrying a backpack system mounted with sensors in 3D, by merging rotation estimates from scan matching and translation estimates from visual odometry, resulting in a 1% loop closure error.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for determining impact forces associated with an abrupt velocity change when a free-flying body comes into contact with another body. Hard impact is considered where deformation of the impacting surfaces is negligible. The proposed approach uses a discrete algebraic model of impact in conjunction with moment and tangential coefficients of restitution (CORs) to develop a general impact law for determining post-impact velocities. This process depends on impulse-momentum theory, complementarity conditions, a principle of maximum dissipation, and the determination of impact and contact forces as well as post-impact accelerations. The proposed methodology also uses an energy-modifying COR to directly control the system's energy profile over time. The approach is illustrated on a planar bicycle-like structure.",

        "abstract": "A heavy payload attached to the wrist force/moment (F/M) sensor of a manipulator can fail the conventional impedance controller to establish a desired impedance due to the non-contact components of the force measurement, i.e., the inertial and gravitational forces of the payload. This paper proposes an impedance control scheme for such a manipulator to accurately shape its force-response without needing any acceleration measurement. Therefore, no wrist accelerometer or a dynamic estimator for compensating the load inertial forces are required. The impedance controller is further developed using an inner/outer loop feedback approach that allows not only to overcome the robot dynamics uncertainty, but also to specify the target impedance model in a general form, e.g., a nonlinear model. The stability and convergence of the impedance controller are analytically investigated, and the results show that that control input remains bounded provided that the desired inertia is selected to be different from the payload inertia. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed impedance controller is able to accurately shape the impedance of a manipulator carrying a relatively heavy load according to a desired impedance model.",

        "abstract": "Physical size of semiconductor components has been reduced and device density has become increased especially during for last years. As a result of this the use of various high precision manipulatable robot systems becomes norm in the industry. Normally the high precision robot system consists of precision staging system, small scale end-effector system, and highly sensitive autonomous sensing system. One of the most popular micromanipulation tasks might be handling of micro-scale objects on a surface. Although many functional aspects and constraints should be considered when the system is constructed, a key concern for the system design is level of dexterity of the manipulator especially when size of the objects to be handled and spatial resolution of the manipulator become smaller than micron or nano scale. And stiction effect has appeared since a micro-contact mechanics phenomena affects more primarily than inertial force in the high precision robot system. Thus a theoretical study has to be developed on a micro-contact mechanics phenomena. In this paper, the organized system is equipped with an omnidirectional accessible manipulation system with a new visual feedback system. Thanks to the enhanced dexterity of the system, in this paper, microparticle stiction problems that could happen to most of small object handling also can be resolved.",

We use both joint offset-free formulation and adjoint transformation errors of joint screws, and apply it to the calibration of an elbow manipulator. Our formulation explains why the original POE calibration always fails with the existence of joint offset errors; the adjoint formulation of joint screw errors eliminates joint screw constraints that was imposed in the original iterated least square calibration algorithm. The second contribution of this paper is the proposal of a modified POE formulation which adopts point measurement data instead of frame measurement data of the end-effector, which can be more realistic and convenient for practical implementation. Simulation results show that the proposed method is plausible and effective. An experiment is under preparation to verify the effectiveness of the proposed calibration method on an elbow manipulator built by Googol Technology.",

Impedance-type haptics devices can leverage these amplifiers to render superior contacts with higher contact stiffness. Use of these amplifiers, however, requires the virtual environment to specify motion commands for each motor. This work extends the recently developed 1-DOF integrated approach to multi-DOF applications. It presents a motion controller working with spring drive amplifiers, together producing the maximum achievable isotropic Cartesian stiffness. Isotropy is necessary to guarantee that haptic contact forces are rendered in the correct direction.

Building upon the results of our recent work in, a provably stable adaptive controller is proposed for variable delay teleoperation. The controller utilizes a model of the system dynamics and the time delay within a predictive control framework to improve the response transparency. It can also adapt to uncertainties in the user and environment dynamics. The performance objectives are delay-free position tracking between the master and slave and the establishment of a virtual mass-damper tool impedance between the user and environment. Delay reduction is accomplished based on a state observer and estimates of the system parameters. Using the delay reduced dynamics, an adaptive output regulation problem is formulated and solved. A Lyapunov-based analysis of the performance and stability of the resulting system is presented. Simulation results with a single-axis teleoperation setup demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "An adaptive cruise control (ACC) which was implemented on an AIT Intelligent Vehicle, a Mitsubishi Galant car, has been improved and added with more features to allow the vehicle to act with better performance compared with the previous system. An important feature of the new adaptive cruise control system is the ability to maintain a proper inter-vehicle gap based on the speed of leading vehicle and time headway (THW). To develop adaptive cruise control system, the conventional throttle valve system is modified to the drive-by-wire system which uses a DC motor to control the throttle valve position based on PD control with command compensation. In the automatic braking system, a DC motor is installed with steel cable transmission in order to pull the brake pedal to the desired level automatically by applying torque control. The brake control and velocity control have been merged together to control the speed to any desired speeds as fast as possible without jerk and steady-state error. A micro switch is installed at the brake pedal to allow the driver to take over the control of the vehicle anytime. There are three important inputs of the ACC system, speed of leading vehicle read from electronic control unit (ECU), THW set by driver, and actual gap measured from a laser scanner. The ACC processes these three inputs in order to calculate distance error and relative velocity which are used as the two inputs of a fuzzy controller. The fuzzy controller determines the desired speed command to maintain a proper gap based on current speed of the leading vehicle and the desired time headway. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the ACC system in various conditions. The results show good performance of the adaptive cruise control system.",

In past study, we focused high maneuverability of the flying robots with the cyclogyro wing, whose rotor had rotation along horizontal axis, and developed some prototypes. The simulation model was also constructed based on the pressure of air. However the Reynolds number was not considered in the constructed simulation model. As a results, the model's accuracy was not enough. On the other hand, the control mechanism for the flight of cyclogyro wing is not yet developed. In this paper, the simulation model is improved by considering the cyclogyro's Reynolds number. The utility of the improved simulation model is verified by comparing simulation results with experimental results. Moreover the new mechanism is suggested for the flight control by controlling the generated force direction. The prototype of the new mechanism is developed and validated by the experiment.",

But the low stiffness has limited the application of industrial robots to the machining tasks with very low precision requirement. This paper presents a practical method to compensate the robot deformation caused by the machining force. A constant joint stiffness model based feed forward compensation scheme is implemented in the robot controller. The compensation scheme is shown to be able to reduce the position error by more than 60%. Application test in milling a standard aluminum block has demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed deformation compensation method. The surface error is reduced from 0.5 mm to 0.1 mm.",

In this paper we illustrate how a substantial run-time gain can be achieved by taking advantage of the extended instruction sets found in modern processors, in particular the SSE1 and SSE2 instruction sets. We present an SSE version of Monte Carlo Localization that results in an impressive 9x speedup over an optimized scalar implementation. In the process, we discuss SSE implementations of atan, atan2 and exp that achieve up to a 4x speedup in these mathematical operations alone.",

The ability to detect vegetation is important for robots operating outdoors, since it enables a robot to navigate more efficiently and safely in such environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting low, grass-like vegetation using laser remission values. In our algorithm, the laser remission is modeled as a function of distance, incidence angle, and material. We classify surface terrain based on 3D scans of the surroundings of the robot. The model is learned in a self-supervised way using vibration-based terrain classification. In all real world experiments we carried out, our approach yields a classification accuracy of over 99%. We furthermore illustrate how the learned classifier can improve the autonomous navigation capabilities of mobile robots.",

At the same time, this fact origins an interesting ongoing research problem: how to organize and arrange big sets of information to be useful in later uses. Topological mapping is a very useful tool to arrange and deal with big amounts of reference images for robotic tasks. There are many previous works on topological mapping and many others use this kind of maps for topological localization, planning and navigation. This work is focused on the problem of carefully design topological map building processes that facilitate the posterior robot tasks that use them and make them safer. We propose a new hierarchy of topological maps focused on this aspect. The experiments included in this paper were run outdoors using omnidirectional images and GPS information, and show the good topological maps obtained and how they allow robust and safer localization and navigation tasks.",

However, UAV accidents still occur at a much higher rate than the accident rate for commercial airliners. Therefore, there is a need to better train UAV pilots and augment their performance to minimize accidents. In this paper, the authors present two methods for generating a chase view point (similar to the view of being towed behind the aircraft). Through use of these viewpoints, the authors propose to increase the situational awareness of UAV operators when flying in cluttered environments. The chase view combines a rotated onboard camera view with a virtual representation of the vehicle and the surrounding operating environment. Experiments were conducted evaluating a chase view versus a traditional onboard camera view during UAV flights using a 6 DOF gantry system. Results showed that the chase view improved UAV operator performance.",

Nevertheless, a-priori knowledge on the intended use of the algorithm can also be exploited to improve its performance, both in terms of precision and computational burden.

This paper proposes incremental learning algorithm of association between symbolized motion patterns and words. The incremental learning is required for robot to autonomously develop the linguistic skill. The algorithm can be derived from optimization of the motion language module under stochastic constraints such that the associative probability of a new training pair composed of symbolized motion pattern and sentence becomes larger. Test of interpreting observed motion as sentences demonstrates the validity of the proposed incremental learning algorithm.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We aim at developing a singer robot capable of listening to music with its own \u00bfears\u00bf and interacting with a human's musical performance. Such a singer robot requires at least three functions: listening to the music, understanding what position in the music is being performed, and generating a singing voice. In this paper, we focus on the second function, that is, the capability to align an audio signal to its musical score represented symbolically. Issues underlying the score alignment problem are: (1) diversity in the sounds of various musical instruments, (2) difference between the audio signal and the musical score, (3) fluctuation in tempo of the musical performance. Our solutions to these issues are as follows: (1) the design of features based on a chroma vector in the 12-tone model and onset of the sound, (2) defining the rareness for each tone based on the idea that scarcely used tone is salient in the audio signal, and (3) the use of a switching Kalman filter for robust tempo estimation. The experimental result shows that our score alignment method improves the average of cumulative absolute errors in score alignment by 29% using 100 popular music tunes compared to the beat tracking without score alignment.",

The proposed method constructs a topological model using sonar gridmap by extracting subregions incrementally. A confidence for each occupied grid is evaluated to obtain reliable regions in a local gridmap, and a convexity measure is used to extract subregions automatically. Through these processes, the topological model is constructed without predefining the number of subregions in advance and the extracted subregions are guaranteed the convexity. Experimental results verify the performance of proposed method in real home environment.",

        "abstract": "We present an approach for smooth and collision-free navigation of multiple mobile robots amongst each other. Each robot senses its surroundings and acts independently without central coordination or communication with other robots. Our approach uses both the current position and the velocity of other robots to predict their future trajectory in order to avoid collisions. Moreover, our approach is reciprocal and avoids oscillations by explicitly taking into account that the other robots also sense their surroundings and change their trajectories accordingly. We build on prior work related to velocity obstacles and reciprocal velocity obstacles and introduce the concept of hybrid reciprocal velocity obstacles for collision avoidance that takes into account the kinematics of the robots and uncertainty in sensor data. We apply our approach to a set of iRobot Create robots using centralized sensing and show natural, direct, and collision-free navigation in several challenging scenarios.",

One of the key issues for realizing the intelligent building is how to detect the locations of residents, so that it can provide the interactive services based on the identified need and requests. In this work, we develop a wireless pyroelectric sensory system embedded with traditional fire detector, which can be implanted on the ceiling. Both of wireless transmission model and pyroelectric sensor monitoring system can provide the rough information of residents' location respectively. These data can be further improved by reducing the sensory uncertainty through covariance intersection (CI) data fusion method. Pyroelectric localization system suffers from multi target tracking and wireless pyroelectric sensor system works this issue. With the location obtained from wireless pyroelectric sensor system, intelligent building can offer suitable services.",

The conventional KLT uses images only and its working condition is inherently limited to small appearance change between images. When big optical flows are induced by a camera-ego motion, an inertial sensor attached to the camera can provide a good prediction to preserve the tracking performance. We use a low-grade MEMS-based gyroscope to refine an initial condition of the nonlinear optimization in the KLT. It increases the possibility for warping parameters to be in the convergence region of the KLT. For longer tracking with less drift, we use the affine photometric model and it can effectively deal with camera rolling and outdoor illumination change. Extra computational cost caused by this higher-order motion model is alleviated by restraining the Hessian update and GPU acceleration. Experimental results are provided for both indoor and outdoor scenes and GPU implementation issues are discussed.",

In this paper, we explore issues related to human personal space around robots, beginning with a review of the existing literature in human-robot interaction regarding the dimensions of people, robots, and contexts that influence human-robot interactions. We then present several research hypotheses which we tested in a controlled experiment (N = 30). Using a 2 (robotics experience vs. none: between-participants) \u00d7 2 (robot head oriented toward a participant's face vs. legs: within-participants) mixed design experiment, we explored the factors that influence proxemic behavior around robots in several situations: (1) people approaching a robot, (2) people being approached by an autonomously moving robot, and (3) people being approached by a teleoperated robot. We found that personal experience with pets and robots decreases a person's personal space around robots. In addition, when the robot's head is oriented toward the person's face, it increases the minimum comfortable distance for women, but decreases the minimum comfortable distance for men. We also found that the personality trait of agreeableness decreases personal spaces when people approach robots, while the personality trait of neuroticism and having negative attitudes toward robots increase personal spaces when robots approach people. These results have implications for both human-robot interaction theory and design.",

We implemented and tested a real-time neuronal model based on the Distributed Adaptive Control framework. The model unifies different aspects of insect navigation and foraging including landmark recognition, chemical search, path integration and optimal memory usage. Consistent with recent findings the model supports navigation using heading direction information, thus precluding the use of global information. We tested our model using a mobile robot performing a foraging task. While foraging for chemical sources in a wind tunnel, the robot memorizes the followed trajectories, using information from landmarks and heading direction accumulators. After foraging, landmark navigation is tested with the odor source turned off. Our results show stability against robot kidnapping and generalization of homing behavior to stable mapless landmark navigation. This demonstrates that allocentric and efficient goal-oriented navigation strategies can be generated by relying on purely local information.",

The interest of that filter lies in cooperative environments and in fast vehicles. The paper studies the first case, where a sensor network shares perception data with running robots that receive accurate obeservations with large delays due to acquisition, processing and wireless communications. Promising simulated results comparing a basic particle filter and the proposed one are shown. The paper also investigates a situation where a robot is tracking its position, fusing only odometry and observations from a camera network partially covering the robot path.",

The first layer of IDA, the application layer, is responsible for the mission specific tasks. The second layer, the network layer, is responsible for relaying the information quickly to reduce latency. In order to increase efficiency, we propose an intelligent network layer that evaluates the network traffic through application provided policies. The evaluation assesses improved accuracy in bandwidth limited scenarios. IDA policies permit the application to drop, merge or modify the packets in real time from different sources. We demonstrate how this architecture can be applied to an example application, distributed target tracking. We also propose some new algorithms that can be used in conjunction with IDA for target tracking. Our experiments on this application show that IDA improves system performance when the bandwidth is limited.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel and flexible simulation platform for studying pursuit and evasion in unknown 2-D environments of arbitrary obstacles, in an effort to expand the practical application of pursuit-evasion research. The platform provides realistic simulation of the sensing capability of each robotic agent (either a pursuer or an evader). Each agent uses real-time local sensing to collect information from the environment while it simultaneously plans and executes its motion to best satisfy one or more objectives. The evader's objectives are to reach a specific goal location as quickly as possible and to avoid being caught by the pursuer. The pursuer's objectives are to locate and capture the evader whose motion is unknown, and when the evader is not seen, explore the environment and predict where the evader may be. Under a common real-time planning paradigm, each agent's planner dynamically adapts its goals and objectives to the agent's changing circumstances so that the agent can always choose the best course of action. Simulation results have shown that the introduced approach is an effective means to study sophisticated pursuit-evasion scenarios and accomplish objectives for both the pursuer and the evader in an unknown environment. The platform can be easily expanded to accommodate multiple agents in more complex pursuit-evasion tasks.",

This paper addresses sound source localization working in dynamic environments for robots. Previously, noise robustness and dynamic localized sound selection have been enormous issues for practical use. To correct the issues, a new localization system \u00bfSelective Attention System\u00bf is proposed. The system has four new functions: localization with Generalized EigenValue Decomposition of correlation matrices for noise robustness(\u00bfLocalization with GEVD\u00bf), sound source cancellation and focus (\u00bfTarget Source Selection\u00bf), human-like dynamic Focus of Attention (\u00bfDynamic FoA\u00bf), and correlation matrix estimation for robotic head rotation (\u00bfCorrelation Matrix Estimation\u00bf). All are achieved by the dynamic design of correlation matrices. The system is implemented into a humanoid robot, and the experimental validation is successfully verified even when the robot microphones move dynamically.",

        "abstract": "Intelligent vehicles require accurate localization relative to a map to ensure safe travel. GPS sensors are among the most useful sensors for outdoor localization, but they still suffer from noise due to weather conditions, tree cover, and surrounding buildings or other structures. In this paper, to improve localization accuracy when GPS fails, we propose a sequential state estimation method that fuses data from a GPS device, an electronic compass, a video camera, and wheel encoders using a particle filter. We process images from the camera using a color histogram-based method to identify the road and non-road regions in the field of view in front of the vehicle. In two experiments, in simulation and on a real vehicle, we demonstrate that, compared to a standard extended Kalman filter not using image data, our method significantly improves lateral localization error during periods of GPS inaccuracy.",

In contrast to full autonomy or direct teleoperation of the robot, the user suggests an overall global navigation route by \u201cdrawing\u201d a path onto the environment while the robot is walking. The path is used by a footstep planner that searches online for a sequence of suitable footstep locations that follow the indicated path as closely as possible while respecting the robot dynamics and overall navigation safety. In this way, the planner provides the robot partial autonomy in selecting precise footstep sequences while the human operator retains high-level control of the global navigation route. We present experimental results of the complete system on the biped humanoid HRP-2 navigating on and around various platforms, chairs, and stairs. We use an augmented reality system so that interactively drawing paths on the world is intuitive and natural.",

Our robot learns by physically interacting with an object using its end effector. This departs from eye-in-hand systems that move the camera while keeping the scene static. Our robot leverages a simple nudge action to obtain the motion segmentation of an object in stereo. The robot uses the segmentation results to pick up the object. The robot collects training images by rotating the grasped object in front of a camera. Robotic experiments show that this interactive object learning approach can deal with top-heavy and fragile objects. Trials confirm that the robot-learned object models allow robust object recognition.",

        "abstract": "This paper is the continuation of our previous work in intercontinental, collaborative teleoperation with a humanoid robot. Our new achievement consists in an extension of the former single-arm bilateral teleoperation setting to include bimanual manipulation and walking. A coupling scheme for simultaneous manipulation and locomotion is developed. Furthermore, a task-based control framework, including a force-based control for the arms as well as a walking pattern generation, is presented to realize stable whole-body motions of the highly redundant humanoid robot. Experiments have been performed to assess the proposed control scheme. They bring to light additional scientific challenges that remain in order to reach a smooth and natural telepresent collaboration.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "When analyzed in the tangential speed domain, human movements exhibit a multi-peaked speed profile which is commonly interpreted as evidence for submovements. At slow speeds, the number of the peaks increases and the peaks also become more distinct, corresponding to non-smoothness or intermittency in the movement. In this study, we evaluate two potential sources proposed in the literature for the origins of movement intermittency and conclude that intermittency is more likely due to noise in the neuromuscular system as opposed to a central movement planner that generates intermittent plans. This conclusion is based on the assumption that the central planner would be expected to introduce similar levels of intermittency for different joints, while accumulating noise in the neuromuscular circuitry would be expected to exhibit itself as increase in noise in distal direction. We have used a 3D motion capture system to record trajectories of fingertip, wrist, elbow and shoulder as five participants completed a simple manual circular tracking task at various constant speed levels. Statistical analyses indicated that movement intermittency, quantified by a number of peaks metric, increased in distal direction, supporting the noise model for origins of intermittency. Movement speed was determined to have a significant effect on intermittency, while orientation of the task plane showed no significance.",

Our approach extracts local features from the input images, searches for the reference pattern, and then produces the 3D pose in camera coordinate system, using only a single reference image and the 6-DOF pose in it. We have created an RT (Robot Technology) component that can be used in any RT-based system, and developed an algorithm that can extend the range of detection and produce robust pose estimation. For evaluation, we have integrated our vision component in an autonomous robot system with a search-and-grasp task, and tested it with several objects that are found in ordinary domestic environment. We present the details of our approach, the design of our modular component design, and the results of the experiments in this paper.",

How useful these camera systems are is very dependent upon the positioning of the cameras. This is especially true if the cameras are to be used in automated systems as a beneficial camera placement will simplify image processing operations. Therefore, a reliable positioning algorithm can lower the processing requirements of the system. In this paper several considerations for improving camera placement are investigated with the goal of developing a general algorithm that can be applied to a variety of systems. This paper presents this algorithm for placement problem in the context of computer vision and robotics.

For robotic systems with many sensors, they are often time-consuming to use, and can also lead to inaccurate results. In this paper, we combine a number of ideas in the literature to derive a unified framework that jointly calibrates many sensors a large system. Key to our approach are (i) grouping sensors to produce 3D data, thereby providing a unifying formalism that allows us to jointly calibrate all of the groups at the same, (ii) using a variety of geometric constraints to perform the calibration, and (iii) sharing sensors between groups to increase robustness. We show that this gives a simple method that is easily applicable to calibrating large systems. Our experiments show that this method not only reduces calibration error, but also requires less human time.",

While knowledge representation and reasoning has been a well-established research field in artificial intelligence for several decades, little work has been done to design and realize knowledge processing mechanisms for the use in the context of robotic control. In this paper, we report on KNOWROB, a knowledge processing system particularly designed for autonomous personal robots. KNOWROB is a first-order knowledge representation based on description logics that provides specific mechanisms and tools for action-centered representation, for the automated acquisition of grounded concepts through observation and experience, for reasoning about and managing uncertainty, and for fast inference - knowledge processing features that are particularly necessary for autonomous robot control.",

        "abstract": "Less degree-of-freedom robots are useful for special applications. Specifically, practical application of 4-DOF parallel mechanism has been rare, though synthesis on this type has been conducted quite a few. Recently, we proposed a revolute joint-based 3T1R 4-DOF parallel mechanism having Schonflies motions whose output rotational motion is a roll motion. This work proposes another type of a new 3T1R 4-DOF parallel mechanism having Schonflies motions whose rotational motion is a pitch motion. The position analysis and kinematic modeling for the mechanism are performed, and its workspace size and kinematic characteristic with respect to the kinematic isotropic characteristic are examined. To support high potential of the mechanism for real applications, three different versions are suggested and each motion capability is verified through its simulator. Finally, a prototype is developed to verity its actual motion capability.",

The sensor is based on an optical measurement, with a particular architecture to provide a very low cross-sensitivity. Its structure allows to simultaneously tune the sensor stiffness and the measurement amplitude of the optical sensor. To do so, kinematic singularities of parallel structures are used as well as the principles of dissociated metrology structure. The design of the sensor is first introduced by a kinematic analysis, before detailing its behavior using Finite Element Analysis. A prototype is finally introduced with first experimental results.",

Operations on small animals require high accuracy positioning during needle insertion.

        "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to time-optimal kinodynamic motion planning for a mobile robot. A global path planner is used to generate collision-free straight-line paths from the robot's position to a given goal location. With waypoints of this path, an initial trajectory is generated which defines the planned position of the robot over time. A velocity profile is computed that accounts for constraints on the velocity and acceleration of the robot. The trajectory is refined to minimize the time needed for traversal by an any-time optimization algorithm. An error-feedback controller generates motor commands to execute the planned trajectory. Quintic Be\u00bfzier splines are used to allow for curvature-continuous joins of trajectory segments, which enables the system to replan trajectories in order to react to unmapped obstacles. Experiments on real robots are presented that show our system's capabilities of smooth, precise, and predictive motion.",

The primary contribution of this paper is a curve model we call lateral uncertainty, which describes the uncertainty of a curve estimate along the lateral direction at various points on the curve, and does not attempt to capture uncertainty along the longitudinal direction of the curve. Additionally, our method incorporates expected road curvature information derived from an empirical study of a real road network. Our method is notable in that it accurately captures the geometry of arbitrarily complex lane boundary curves that are not well approximated by straight lines or low-order polynomial curves. Our method operates independently of the direction of travel of the vehicle, and incorporates sensor uncertainty associated with individual observations. We analyze the benefits and drawbacks of the approach, and show results of our algorithm applied to real world data sets.",

        "abstract": "Optical adhesion control of a functional gel microtool, made of hydrophilic photo-crosslinkable resin, was developed for on-chip cell manipulation. The functional gel microtool used can be manipulated by optical tweezers and functionalized by spiropyran chromospheres, which is a photochromic polymer. Spiropyran chromospheres were used for temporal cell adhesion of the gel microtool. The adhesiveness of the gel microtools was controlled by photo irradiation. The gel microtools adhere to glass and other gel microtools, in an electrolyte solution of adjusted concentration, after ultraviolet (UV) illumination. By controlling the electrolyte concentration, the adhesion to cells can be selected as either permanent or temporal cell adhesions. UV illumination caused the cell to adhere to the gel microtool, while VIS illumination detached it from the gel-microtool. We also produced a pH sensing gel microtool by modifying the gel microtool with a pH indicator, bromothymol blue (BTB). The pH value was measured by detecting the color of the gel microtool with calibrated color information. Local measurements of the ambient pH value of a single yeast cell were performed by a ring shaped gel microtool and by immobilizing the cell on the surface of the pH sensing gel microtool.",

        "abstract": "Cameras are popular sensors for robot navigation tasks such as localization as they are inexpensive, lightweight, and provide rich data. However, fast movements of a mobile robot typically reduce the performance of vision-based localization systems due to motion blur. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning approach to choose appropriate velocity profiles for vision-based navigation. The learned policy minimizes the time to reach the destination and implicitly takes the impact of motion blur on observations into account. To reduce the size of the resulting policies, which is desirable in the context of memory-constrained systems, we compress the learned policy via a clustering approach. Extensive simulated and real-world experiments demonstrate that our learned policy significantly outperforms any policy that uses a constant velocity. We furthermore show, that our policy is applicable to different environments. Additional experiments demonstrate that our compressed policies do not result in a performance loss compared to the originally learned policy.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "When grasping an object, a robot must identify the available forms of interaction with that object. Each of these forms of interaction, a grasp affordance, describes one canonical option for placing the hand and fingers with respect to the object as an agent prepares to grasp it. The affordance does not represent a single hand posture, but an entire manifold within a space that describes hand position/orientation and finger configuration. Our challenges are 1) how to represent this manifold in as compact a manner as possible, and 2) how to extract these affordance representations given a set of example grasps as demonstrated by a human teacher. In this paper, we approach the problem of representation by capturing all instances of a canonical grasp using a joint probability density function (PDF) in a hand posture space. The PDF captures in an object-centered coordinate frame a combination of hand orientation, grasp centroid position and offset from hand to centroid. The set of canonical grasps is then represented using a mixture distribution model. We address the problem of learning the model parameters from a set of example grasps using a clustering approach based on expectation maximization. Our experiments show that the learned canonical grasps correspond to the functionally different ways that the object may be grasped. In addition, by including the grasp centroid/hand relationship within the learned model, we eliminate this as a hard-coded parameter and the resulting approach is capable of separating different grasp types, even when the different types involve similar hand postures.",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of foothold selection in robotic legged locomotion over very rough terrain. The difficulty of the problem we address here is comparable to that of human rock-climbing, where foot/hand-hold selection is one of the most critical aspects. Previous work in this domain typically involves defining a reward function over footholds as a weighted linear combination of terrain features. However, a significant amount of effort needs to be spent in designing these features in order to model more complex decision functions, and hand-tuning their weights is not a trivial task. We propose the use of terrain templates, which are discretized height maps of the terrain under a foothold on different length scales, as an alternative to manually designed features. We describe an algorithm that can simultaneously learn a small set of templates and a foothold ranking function using these templates, from expert-demonstrated footholds. Using the LittleDog quadruped robot, we experimentally show that the use of terrain templates can produce complex ranking functions with higher performance than standard terrain features, and improved generalization to unseen terrain.",

In this scenario, a mobile robot uses 2D laser range data to recognize, track and avoid moving targets. Most previous approaches either rely on pre-defined data features or off-line training of a classifier for specific data sets, thus eliminating the possibility to detect and track different-shaped moving objects. We propose a novel and adaptive technique where potential moving objects are classified and learned in real-time using a fuzzy ART neural network algorithm.

Hydraulic actuation demonstrates significant competitive advantages when minimum weight and volume, large forces and wide range of speeds are required and this makes it very suitable for systems such as legged robots. The geometry and design of leg mechanisms have great effect on the actuation system performance such as the required flow, which directly determines the size/weight and power density, in turn affecting the performance of the robot. This paper describes the mechanism and operation principle of two 2-DOF legs considered for HyQ, a hydraulically actuated quadruped robot. Numerical studies have been done to investigate the required flow, the pressure in the actuator chambers and the efficiency of the two leg mechanisms. The results show that the second leg design reduces the required flow significantly with less pressure-jump in the actuator and higher efficiency.",

However, using our wide human vocabulary, we often refer to objects in terms that are incomprehensible to the robot. This paper focuses on lexical entrainment to solve this problem. Lexical entrainment is the phenomenon of people tending to adopt the terms of their interlocutor. While this has been well studied in human-computer interaction, few published papers have approached it in human-robot interaction. To investigate how lexical entrainment occurs in human-robot interaction, we conduct experiments where people instruct the robot to move objects. Our results show that two types of lexical entrainment occur in human-robot interaction. We also discuss the effects of the state of objects on lexical entrainment. Finally, we developed a test bed system for recognizing a referred-to object on the basis of knowledge from our experiments.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method of light pattern blur estimation for its application to automatic projector focus control in structured light 3D camera. To overcome shortcoming of the conventional methods for estimating blur of light pattern, we propose to normalise the light pattern image incorporating reference images. Which are made available by a structured light 3D camera. The reference black and white patterns are utilised in such a way as to eliminate the dependence of intensity variation around an edge on surface reflectivity. Then the unknown blur radius is estimated from the first derivative of normalised edge. Experimental results on both synthetic and real images verify that the proposed method is indeed independent of surface reflectivity and is accurate and sensitive enough to the small change of blur. Finally, based on the proposed light pattern blur estimation, a structured light 3D camera that is equipped with automatic multi-stage focus control in a beam projector has been built to demonstrate its capability of capturing the 3D workspace of large depth variations.",

We study a new version of this game which takes place in a Euclidean environment with a circular obstacle. We present a complete characterization of the game: for each player, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for winning the game. Their (continuous time) strategies are constructed using techniques from differential games and arguments from geometry. Our main result is a decision algorithm which takes arbitrary initial positions as input, declares one of the players as the winner of the game and outputs a winning strategy for that player. We extend our approach to explicitly construct, in closed form, the decision boundary that partitions the arena into win and lose regions.",

Such contamination is one of the major hampers to achieve accurate and efficient AFM based nanomanipulation. Based on contaminated images, the manipulation operations often fail. In this paper, we apply a local scan method to identify and compensate the thermal drift contamination in the AFM image. After an AFM image is captured, the entire image is divided into several parts along y direction. A local scan is immediately performed in each part of the image to calculate the drift value at that very part. In this manner, the drift value is calculated in a small local area instead of the global image. Thus, the drift can be more precisely estimated and the image can be more accurately recovered, which lead to improved accuracy for AFM imaging and enhanced productivity for AFM based nanomanipulation.",

C. elegans has complex outer and inner structures constructed by approximately one thousand cells. For example, the lateral alae are the surface fine structure by seam cell body. In this paper, their fine structures were observed by E-SEM directly; without any drying or dyeing processes. The observation environments are controlled under different E-SEM chamber pressures for clear observation of C. elegans. The local stiffness of C. elegans was measured by buckling measurement method of the nanoprobe fabricated by focus ion beam (FIB) etching at the tip of atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever. The measurement position can arbitrarily be controlled by the nanorobotic manipulator inside the E-SEM. In this work, from experimental results, the measured elasticity on lateral alae was 1.6 times larger than it around lateral alae. This local stiffness measurement technique can readily be applied to reveal unknown biological local stiffness, cell health conditions and novel cell diagnosis.",

The mechanism designs and the control methodologies might vary as the fundamental knowledge is learnt from different species of fish. However, all those systems can be divided into two major types in general, namely: serial open chain design and parallel mechanism design from an engineering viewpoint. The general solutions to the swimming motion planning for the type with parallel mechanism are discussed by using the kinematics equations, followed by the derivation of analytical gait control functions. The application of these solutions on a manta fish prototype and an eight-joint MPF (media and/or paired fin) fish prototype shows the good agreement with the proposed modeling in the steady swimming and forward/backward swimming.",

        "abstract": "SLAM is a well studied technique for robots to build a map of environments while at the same time keeping track of their pose (position and orientation). However SLAM does not provide control approaches for how the robot moves around the environment. This paper presents an integrated approach to create a fully autonomous exploring and mapping robot. An EKF-SLAM approach is used to fuse Advanced Sonar and Laser Scan-Matching. This also tackles the problem of map-drifts in some types of environment where lasers do not supply sufficient information in some directions such as along a corridor. In addition, the proposed exploration algorithm takes advantage of the characteristic of the Voronoi Graph to enable the robot to strategically explore the environments in a loop-closing fashion and safe manner. By revisiting areas to close loops as early as possible, the robot can build a more stable map incrementally while still reliably tracking its pose. Experimental results of the integrated approach are shown to demonstrate the algorithm provides real-time exploration of a mobile robot in an initially unknown real environment. Experimental comparisons of exploration strategies with and without early local loop closing demonstrate the benefits of the approach in the map quality.",

Powerful permanent magnets imbedded in each foot allow the robot to hang from a steel ceiling powerlessly. Although the magnets are passive, the attractive force is modulated by tilting the foot against the steel surface. This allows the robot to slide its feet along the surface using \u201cMoonwalk\u201d and \u201cShuffle\u201d gait patterns. The robot can also detach its feet and swing them over small obstacles. These diverse walking patterns are created with a single servoed joint and 2 sets of simple locking mechanisms. Kinematic and static conditions are obtained for the under-actuated legged robot to perform each gait pattern safely and stably. A proof-of-concept prototype robot is designed, built, and tested. Experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the design concept and verify the analytical results.",

Although solving unknown environment planning problems with randomized model based approaches seems very promising, no systematic study has been reported as to how to adopt model based planners into the sensor based problem domain effectively. In this paper, we study the adoption issues of model based planners to tackle sensor based planning problems, and hence provide conversion guidelines from one to other problem domain. In addition, we discuss the range effect of the sensitive skin type sensor, IPA, for on-line planning in unknown environments. Some experimental results in an unknown environment are presented in the paper as well.",

This paper presents the development of a mathematical model of the prediction mechanism in the context of a Bayes filter, which is the predominant schema used for integrating temporal data in the field of robot mapping and localization problems. We propose a generalized anticipatory Bayes filter that uses revised sensor values obtained from the prediction process at the measurement-update step to enhance the performance of the sensor model. The development of a generalized anticipatory Bayes filter is not only an extension of the original Bayes filter, but also a mathematical model of the human prediction mechanism of sensory processing.

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is based on the Gaussian noise with zero mean and should know the correct prior knowledge of control and measurement noise covariance matrices. If these conditions are not satisfied, EKF unavoidably diverges. The present paper proposes the method of a new adaptive kalman filter to be supported by Measurement Noise Estimator (MNE), which estimates the measurement noise distribution including biased noise and noise covariance, whenever the update step executes. We evaluate this method under well-known benchmark environment for SLAM problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm overcomes degrading performance of the standard EKF under the condition of wrong knowledge of sensor statistics.",

This prototype sensor has the ability to measure forces from the sides and tip. Classification of forces from multiple positions on a catheter provides valuable information for safe navigation inside the vasculature and heart of a patient. This sensor employs two fibre-optic schemes, one for the tip and one for the sides of the catheter; it is made entirely of plastic, making it compatible with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A test bench was used to determine the linearity coefficients during static loading. These initial experiments on the prototype gave rise to an ideal linear force response coupled with low hysteresis. Finally, an experiment which tries to simulate the human blood vessel achieved satisfying results during dynamic sensor movement.",

Some micromanipulation methods have been reported in the literature to measure cell mechanics, but they are either high-costly or difficultly-operated. This paper presents our approach to use microrobotic cell injection technology as the test bed to characterize the mechanical properties of biological cells, by virtue of low cost and easy operation. By extending our previous work [41], we develop a mechanical model to interpret the mechanical responses during microinjection and extract the cells properties. Both finite element analysis and microinjection experiments are performed to verify the mechanical model. It is shown that the results obtained from the proposed mechanical model agree well with that obtained from finite element analysis and the experiments. Elastic moduli of zebrafish embryos at different developmental stages are characterized. This demonstrates not only the validity of the proposed model but also the fact that the microrobotic cell injection technology combining with the mechanical model can be used to characterize the mechanical properties of biological cells.",

        "abstract": "The loss of fingers and hands severely limits career and lifestyle options for the amputee. Unfortunately, while there have been strides made in advancements of upper arm and leg prosthetics, the state of the art in prosthetic hands is lagging far behind. Options are generally limited to claw like devices that provide limited gripping capacity. The overall objective of this paper is to demonstrate a path towards a low-cost prosthetic hand with multiple articulated fingers and a thumb that rivals the human hand in terms of weight, size, dexterity, range of motion, force carrying capacity and speed. We begin with a description of the functional requirements for a human hand. When comparing requirements with actuation technologies, the fluid power approach has the potential to realize a prosthetic hand that rivals a human hand in size, strength and dexterity. We introduce a new actuation technology, mesofluidics, that focuses on miniaturization of fluid power to the meso-scale (mm to cm). As a novel demonstration of the potential for this technology, we describe a proof-of-principle mesofluidic finger that has intrinsic actuation and control (actuators and control valves within the volume of the finger). This finger weighs 63 grams, is sized to the 50th percentile male finger, has a total of 25 mechanical parts and is capable of providing 10 kg (22 lbs) of pinch force.",

        "abstract": "For a new class of soft robotic platforms, development of flexible and robust actuators is quintessential. Remarkable resilience, shape memory effect, high energy density, and scalability are attributed to nickel titanium (NiTi) making it an excellent actuator candidate for meso-scale applications. This paper presents a micro-muscle fiber crafted from shape memory alloy (NiTi) coiled springs. An enhanced spring NiTi model describes the combination of martensite deformation and spring effect due to its geometry. This paper also describes a manufacturing process and characterization for micro-scale NiTi coil actuators in various annealing temperatures. The presented fiber is 400\u00b5m in diameter and 0.5m in length exhibiting 50% contraction and 1226J/kg of energy density with 40g of force. By changing the geometry of the spring, force-displacement characteristics can be tuned. An enhanced-performance inverted-spring manufacturing method is also described and characterized. A method of discrete displacement control is presented. Taking advantage of the flexibility of micro-coil spring, we present a novel mesh-worm prototype that utilizes bio-inspired antagonistic actuation for its body deformation and locomotion.",

The station is composed of two long travel range and high resolution robots equipped with self-sensing nanoprobes that are able to cooperate with each other and with standard AFM systems, over a common sample. The robots are guided by the use of an upright high-depth-of-field optical microscope to perform complex nano-bio characterization experiments. To achieve the required precision between the two robots reference frames, specific image processing techniques are needed. One of the tips is dedicated to acquire the topography of the sample at nano scale while the second probe performs the biocharacterization experiments. The obtained results show that the two robots can cooperate within the required resolution in bacterial nanomechanical characterization while high resolution topographic images are acquired.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the vision-based methods developed for assembly of complex and solid 3D MEMS (micro electromechanical systems) structures. The microassembly process is based on sequential robotic operations such as planar positioning, gripping, orientation in space and insertion tasks. Each of these microassembly tasks is performed using a pose-based visual control. To be able to control the microassembly process, a 3D model-based tracker is used. This tracker is able to directly provide the 3D micro-object pose at real-time and from only a single view of the scene. The methods proposed in this paper are validated on an automatic assembly of fives silicon microparts of 400 \u00b5m \u00d7 400 \u00b5m \u00d7 100 \u00b5m on 3-levels. The insertion tolerance (mechanical play) is estimated to 3 \u00b5m. The precision of this insertion tolerance allows us to obtain solid and complex micro electromechanical structures without any external joining (glue, wending. Promising positioning and orientation accuracies are obtained who can reach 0.3 \u00b5m in position and 0.2\u00b0 in orientation.",

This paper presents a model and experimentations of the generation of bubbles. In the microsystems which uses liquid, gas bubbles can generate forces due to the surface tension at their interface. To use these bubbles, it is necessary to generate them in a controlled way. In this paper, we propose to study the generation of a bubble having a defined volume, using a syringe pump based device. We first build a mathematical model to predict the growth of the bubble in the liquid. Indeed, the compressibility of the gas and the effect of surface tension are of major importance at microscale, and our model will demonstrate the existence of an instability during the bubble growth. We proceed with a dimensionless study that will allow to predict the existence of the instability on the basis of a dimensionless number. Finally, we present experimental results to validate the mathematical model.",

The helical swimmer consists of an InGaAs/GaAs/Cr helical nanobelt tail fabricated by a self-scrolling technique with dimensions similar to a natural flagellum, and a thin soft-magnetic metal \u00bfhead\u00bf consisting of a Cr/Ni/Au multi-layer. The swimming locomotion of ABF is precisely controlled in 3-D by external rotating magnetic fields. Microsphere manipulation is performed by ABF, and experimental results show that both the position and the orientation of microspheres can be precisely controlled. The propelling force of ABF is in the pico-Newton range. We also describe a swarm-like behavior in which three ABF swim in a pack, indicating the potential to handle several micro objects in parallel. Self-propelled devices such as these are candidates for wireless 6-DOF micro and nanomanipulation tools for handling cellular and sub-cellular objects.",

Multiple Mag-\u03bcBot control is enabled by employing an array of individually addressable electrostatic surfaces to selectively anchor individual Mag-\u03bcBots. Coupled parallel and uncoupled serial motion of multiple robots is demonstrated, and they can combine to form an assembly that is also capable of motion. Manipulation of 230 \u00b5m diameter microspheres is also demonstrated cooperatively by two Mag-\u03bcBots in a fluid environment, and is enhanced when the two Mag-\u03bcBots are combined. An analysis of the electrostatic anchoring forces and the forces relevant to manipulation is discussed.",

The obtained measurements are converted in to movement symbols by means of a Wavelet transform and a fuzzy clustering. These symbols are used both for training HMM and for recognizing the current maneuver. The system has been tested in some in-vitro experiments performing a fictitious surgical protocol.",

To recognize the target speech signal, robot has to separate the target speech signal among other speech signals and recognize the separated speech signal. As separated signal includes distortion, automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance degrades. To avoid the degradation, we trained an acoustic model from non-clean speech signals to adapt acoustic feature of distorted signal and adding white noise to separated speech signal before extracting acoustic feature. The issues are (1) To determine optimal noise level to add the training speech signals, and (2) To determine optimal noise level to add the separated signal. In this paper, we investigate how much noises should be added to clean speech data for training and how speech recognition performance improves for different positions of three talkers with soft masking. Experimental results show that the best performance is obtained by adding white noises of 30 dB. The ASR with the acoustic model outperforms with ASR with the clean acoustic model by 4 points.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the investigation on mobile manipulation of a self-reconfigurable tracked mobile robot, using its tracks for both manipulation and locomotion. It is desirable for a mobile robot to possess manipulation capability in unstructured environments, especially in the scenario which is unsuitable for human beings. However, it is not convenient for such a mobile robot to carry an onboard manipulator and perform grasping and placing operations. An alternative is to realize the manipulation potential of the existing parts and perform manipulation without attaching additional hardware. Besides the enhanced locomotion ability, a self-reconfigurable tracked mobile robot has great potential in manipulation, which may take the forms of box-pushing, cylinder-moving or lateral hitting. However, the manipulation with tracks has to be controlled properly. One challenge is to optimize the tracks' configuration so as to get the optimal contact point. Furthermore, the speed and acceleration of the mobile robot have dramatic influence on mobile manipulation with tracks. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, experiments are conducted using a tracked mobile robot in our laboratory.",

Fuzzy events are triggered by the sensor readings and the inference occurs through a fuzzy rule base system. The supervisor can activate and control fuzzy controllable events simultaneously with fuzzy uncontrollable events to achieve the planned objectives. The fuzzy observability concept is incorporated to represent sensor uncertainties. Fuzzy state based controllability and observability measures are also discussed. The proposed theoretical development is then extended to discuss an application with behavior based control of mobile robots.",

In this paper, we proposed the localization scheme to fusion the RFID localization system, ultrasonic sensor and wheel encoder. The uncertainty is factor caused by each localization system, and the estimation error is affected by this uncertainty. The sensor system for mobile robot localization is technical limitation such as sensing range, operation feature. Therefore we focus on sensor fusion scheme. When the mobile robot moves, certain data combination set to fuse is selected according to the environmental factor. The performance and simplicity of the approach is demonstrated with the result produced by experiments using mobile robot.",

The evolutionary path planner generates intermediate configurations connected via \u03b73-splines that yields a collision-free G3-continuous path, which each point on the path has a closed-form expression. The path planner is implemented as architecture of island parallel genetic algorithm (IPGA) running a variable-length genetic algorithm in each island. The techniques of spatial fitness-sharing in search space and a crowded measure of generated paths are integrated in the planner to implement a high-diversity evolutionary optimizer of paths that could self-adjust the spacing and number of intermediate configurations. The experimental result demonstrates the robustness and self-adjusting capability of evolutionary path planner in discovering shorter and smoother composite \u03b73-splines paths in complex environments.",

However, there have been very few attempts to automate mobile robotic systems for final assembly operations, despite their potential for high flexibility and capability. This paper focuses on methods of tracking a dynamic moving vehicle that is similar to the vehicle body on a moving assembly line. We have investigated two tracking methods, one using a laser scanner and the other using a visual fiducial marker. We have also studied the tracking performance of a mobile base using the pure pursuit algorithm with low pass filtering. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the remaining main challenges in achieving robotic assembly on moving assembly lines.",

The actuator arrays are built from cells, each containing six piezoelectric actuators and an amplification structure; however the results can be generalized to actuator arrays using solenoids, pneumatic cylinders, or any other fast acting linear actuators. The cells are controlled using an all-on all-off bi-stable stochastic process wherein all cells are given a common input probability (control) value which they use to determine whether to actuate or relax. Laying out the cells in different networks gives different actuator array properties, which must be found before the actuator arrays can be applied to manipulators. A method is provided to calculate actuator array properties such as: travel, required actuator strength/displacement, force range, force variance, and robustness for any actuator array configuration. Finally the properties of several illustrative examples are shown and a discussion covers the importance of the properties, trends between actuator array layouts and their properties, and the course of future work in the area.",

        "abstract": "Humans and mammals possess their own feet. Using the mobility of their feet, they are able to walk in various environments such as plain land, desert, swamp, and so on. Previously developed biped robots and four-legged robots did not employ such adaptable foot. In this work, a biomimetic foot mechanism is investigated through analysis of the foot structure of the human-being. This foot mechanism consists of a toe, an ankle, a heel, and springs replacing the foot muscles and tendons. Using five toes and springs, this foot can adapt to various environments. A mathematical modeling for this foot mechanism was performed and its characteristics were observed through numerical simulation.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a methodology for the modeling and control of internal forces and moments produced during multi-contact interactions between humanoid robots and the environment. The approach is based on the virtual linkage model which provides a physical representation of the internal forces and moments acting between the various contacts. The forces acting at the contacts are decomposed into internal and resulting forces and the latter are represented at the robot's center of mass. A grasp/contact matrix describing the complex interactions between contact forces and center of mass behavior is developed. Based on this model, a new torque-based approach for the control of internal forces is suggested and illustrated on the Asimo humanoid robot. The new controller is integrated into the framework for whole-body prioritized multitasking enabling the unified control of operational tasks, postures, and internal forces.",

        "abstract": "There are many kinds of deformable objects in our living life. Some of them such as human tissues, human organs, and food exhibit rheological behaviors when they are subject to external force. In surgery simulation and food engineering, we need to simulate or control such behaviors. In this paper, four-element model associated with finite element (FE) method was employed to model rheological deformation. This model can reach a good approximation of rheological force response when the object experience a standard strain input. An identification approach for estimating physical parameters of rheological deformation was presented based on 2D FE simulation and nonlinear optimization. This identification method aimed at minimizing the difference of force response between the simulation and experiment by using nonlinear least square method. Finally, experiments and identification results were given and both modeling and identification method were validated by comparing the results of simulation and experiments.",

The highly-articulated body of a snake robot combined with the advantages of wheeled locomotion makes it ideal for locomotion in, for example, pipes and other narrow or constricted structures. In this paper we present a mathematical model of the dynamics of a snake robot with active wheels together with a novel path-following approach for such robots. The path-following approach includes both how to find a desired turning angle for the snake robot head given a reference path, together with a module coordination strategy based on a n-trailer kinematic model. The path-following approach is tested and verified by simulations with the dynamic model. In addition, simulations suggest that the proposed approach results in reduced commanded joint and wheels shaft torques and, in most cases, a reduced path-following error compared to an implementation of a follow-the-leader algorithm.",

Following the same reasoning, we present a motion model extension that utilizes the same polar parameterization to achieve improved modeling of mobile robot motion in between measurements, gaining robustness with no additional overhead.

This paper presents a method to apply a robot's active sensing experience for creating the tool-body assimilation model. The model is composed of a feature extraction module, dynamics learning module, and a tool recognition module. Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is used for the feature extraction module to extract object features from raw images. Multiple Time-scales Recurrent Neural Network (MTRNN) is used as the dynamics learning module. Parametric Bias (PB) nodes are attached to the weights of MTRNN as second-order network to modulate the behavior of MTRNN based on the tool. The generalization capability of neural networks provide the model the ability to deal with unknown tools. Experiments are performed with HRP-2 using no tool, I-shaped, T-shaped, and L-shaped tools. The distribution of PB values have shown that the model has learned that the robot's dynamic properties change when holding a tool. The results of the experiment show that the tool-body assimilation model is capable of applying to unknown objects to generate goal-oriented motions.",

It presents a mathematical model of the falling system that correlates well with experimental reorientation results about one axis. The model also explains why the the process of flipping around is practical only about the long axis of the robot. For more robust orientation correction, a different configuration of CKbot and a new motion plan is presented that corrects for all forms of posture error.",

The proposed algorithms are integrated with simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with a focus on indoor aerial vehicle applications. We experimentally validate the proposed algorithms by using a fully self-contained micro aerial vehicle (MAV) with on-board image processing and SLAM capabilities. The range measurement strategy is inspired by the key adaptive mechanisms for depth perception and pattern recognition found in humans and intelligent animals. The navigation strategy assumes an unknown, GPS-denied environment, which is representable via corner-like feature points and straight architectural lines. Experimental results show that the system is only limited by the capabilities of the camera and the availability of good corners.",

        "abstract": "Mobility in small ground robots is often improved by novel mechanisms or wheel designs. This can be successful when navigating rough terrain or climbing small obstacles. However, few such robots are capable of scaling obstacles of arbitrary height or traversing all types of terrain. This paper presents a concept for a miniature robot that combines wheeled ground locomotion with rotary-wing flight capabilities, which has the potential to offer the best features of both helicopters and ground vehicles while addressing the aforementioned challenges to mobility.",

        "abstract": "Self-assembly is a process in which individual components form an organized structure as a consequence of local interactions. When using magnetics to create interaction forces, the magnetic flux distribution of a self-assembling system changes as its assembly state varies. Since Hall effect sensors are a convenient and effective means to detect changes in the magnetic field, we explore their applicability to monitoring the morphology of such magnetically self-assembling systems. We find that optimal positions for the sensor can be found where the flux changes maximally. Our analysis is applied to two different systems by deriving the flux changes for all possible states, and theoretical flux changes are verified with experiments. In addition, we show that a small number of sensors is sufficient for robust state determination. In addition to state detection, experiments show the potential for angle measurement for compliant cylindrical magnet joints using a single Hall sensor.",

Protocols that enable two unicycle vehicles modulating their relative separation in the plane to effectively exchange information, as well as nonlinear control laws that enable these protocols are presented. Only local information is assumed for the control action. We illustrate the contextual nature of such signaling by showing applications to secure communication as well as robot formation motion.

        "abstract": "Moving objects are present in many robotic applications. An accurate detection and motion estimation of these objects can be crucial for the success and safety of the robot and people surrounding it. This paper presents a new probabilistic framework for clustering dependent or relational data, applied to the problem of motion clustering and estimation. While conventional techniques such as scan differencing perform well in many cases, they usually assume that a good pose estimate is available and fail when points belonging to dynamic objects show some overlap in consecutive readings. The technique proposed, CRF-Clustering, by explicitly reasoning about the underlying motion of the object, is able to deal with poor initial motion estimate and overlapping points. Moreover, it is able to consider the dependencies between neighbor points in the scans to reduce the noise in the clustering assignment. The model parameters can be estimated from labeled data in a statistically sound learning procedure. Experiments show that CRF-Clustering is able to detect moving objects, cluster them and estimate their motion.",

This mobile robot consists of two casters with servo brakes, one passive rigid wheel and a controller. We can manipulate the robot by controlling external force/moment applied by a human based on the control of the servo brakes attached to the casters. We consider the characteristics of the servo brakes and control the brake torque of each caster based on the braking force and moment constraint so that several motion functions of the robot are realized based on the applied force. This allows the robot to track a path without using servo motors. The motion control based on the environment information is also realized, so that we could avoid the collision with obstacles. These functions are implemented to the robot experimentally and experimental results illustrate the validity of the robot system and its control method.",

We present a solution designed for omnidirectional cameras, although the results can be extended to conventional cameras. The key idea is the selection of a finite set of candidate next positions for every robot within their local landmark-based stochastic maps. In this way, the cost function measuring the perception improvement when a robot moves to a new position can be easily evaluated on the finite set of candidate positions. Then, the robots in the team can coordinate based on these small pieces of information. The proposed strategy is designed to be integrated with a map merging algorithm where robots fuse their maps to get a more precise knowledge of the environment. The interest of the proposed strategy for uncertainty reduction is that it is suitable for visual sensing, allows an efficient information exchange, presents a low computational cost and makes the robot coordination easier.",

In this paper, we propose a motion modification method that combines affective nuances with arbitrary motions of humanoid robots to induce humans to intended reactions by expressing affective states. The method is applicable to various humanoid robots that differ in degrees of freedom or appearances, and the affective nuances are parametrically expressed in a two-dimensional model comprised of valence and arousal. The experimental results showed that the desired affective nuances could be expressed by our method, but it also suggested some limitations. We believe that the method will contribute to interactive systems in which robots can communicate with appropriate expressions in various contexts.",

A reverse turn planner is firstly investigated, based on primitives connected together to easily generate the reference motion. Then, both steering and speed control algorithms are presented to accurately guide the vehicle. They are based on a kinematic model extended with additional sliding parameters and on model predictive control approaches. Real world experiments have been carried out on a low adherent terrain with an experimental mobile robot. At the end of each row, the reverse turn is automatically generated to connect the next reference track, and the maneuver is autonomously performed by the vehicle. Reported experiments demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed algorithms.",

The robot has a dexterous mechanism with similar distribution of actuators' capability and a pair of mechanical joint stops like human beings. The proposed motion planning method combines target dynamics together with port-controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) system theory resulting in an energy controller which not only takes the mechanical joint stops into account but also realizes torque compensation from a high-power actuator to a low-power actuator. Simulation and experimental results prove the proposed method can generate the golf swings with specified hitting speed and finish position for our specially designed robot.",

        "abstract": "An active cannula is a medical device composed of thin, pre-curved, telescoping tubes that may enable many new surgical procedures. Planning optimal motions for these devices is challenging due to their kinematics, which involve both beam mechanics and space curves. In this paper, we propose an optimization-based motion planning algorithm that computes actions to guide the device to a target point while avoiding obstacles in the environment. The planner uses a simplified active cannula kinematic model that neglects beam mechanics, and focuses on planning for the (piecewise circular) space curves. The method is intended for use in image-guided procedures where the target and obstacles can be segmented from pre-procedure images. Given the target location, the start position and orientation, and a geometric representation of obstacles, the algorithm computes the insertion length and orientation angle for each tube of the active cannula such that the device follows a collision-free path to the target. We formulate the planning problem as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem and use a penalty method to convert this formulation into a sequence of more easily solvable unconstrained optimization problems. Simulations demonstrate optimal paths for a 3-tube active cannula with spherical obstacles. The algorithm typically computes plans in less than 1 minute on a standard PC.",

It is planned in the augmented state-time space of the robot arm configuration and the positions of the moving objects. Various techniques are used to accelerate planning and enhance its safety. We used the new planner to develop the dual-arm planner, and it can be used as the basis to solve higher level problems in motion planning. The experiments show that the proposed method can effectively resolve the dual-arm motion planning problem.",

For avoiding the vibrated zero moment point(ZMP) behavior due to the mechanical resonance, the vibration control method is proposed in the paper. The deviated center of gravity (COG) due to the ankle's deflection is measured in real-time by laser distance sensor, and equivalent reaction force relating to COG deviation is used as feedback signal for vibration control. The reaction force feedback also enables the regulation of the compliant property of the robots. Therefore the proposed approach is suitable to stabilize the walking behavior including the impact between foot and floor environments. The validity is evaluated by several experimental results.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The ability to detect, and track multiple moving objects like person and other robots, is an important prerequisite for mobile robots working in dynamic indoor environments. We approach this problem by detecting independently moving objects in image sequence from a monocular camera mounted on a robot. We use multi-view geometric constraints to classify a pixel as moving or static. The first constraint, we use, is the epipolar constraint which requires images of static points to lie on the corresponding epipolar lines in subsequent images. In the second constraint, we use the knowledge of the robot motion to estimate a bound in the position of image pixel along the epipolar line. This is capable of detecting moving objects followed by a moving camera in the same direction, a so-called degenerate configuration where the epipolar constraint fails. To classify the moving pixels robustly, a Bayesian framework is used to assign a probability that the pixel is stationary or dynamic based on the above geometric properties and the probabilities are updated when the pixels are tracked in subsequent images. The same framework also accounts for the error in estimation of camera motion. Successful and repeatable detection and pursuit of people and other moving objects in realtime with a monocular camera mounted on the Pioneer 3DX, in a cluttered environment confirms the efficacy of the method.",

Because of Titan's atmospheric opacity, we require the ability to match combinations of visible, infrared (IR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. For both localization and direct use as a multi-modal data product for science analysis, match results must be sub-pixel accurate. We demonstrate the feasibility of matching orbital SAR data to visible and IR imagery and outline a framework for using this data as a navigation product. We demonstrate a technique to compensate for local distortions to enable accurate data registration in spite of differences in sensor return and imaging geometry. Finally, we show match results using both terrestrial imagery and the limited amount of available Titan data acquired by the Cassini orbiter and Huygens probe.",

Since these phenomena are hardly measurable at a reasonable cost, they have to be estimated on-line. A multi-model based observer is here proposed, in order to supply on-line tire cornering stiffnesses (i.e. grip conditions) as well as mobile robot sideslip angles. It takes part of the complementarity between kinematic and dynamic mobile robot models, in order to significantly decrease the number of required robot inertial parameters (since their values are sometimes difficult to obtain). Full scale experiments demonstrate that the proposed observer can supply reactive and reliable sideslip angle estimates, so that high accuracy path tracking can still be achieved, whatever grip conditions and vehicle velocity.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a new vision-based SLAM approach for multi-robot formulation. For a cooperative map reconstruction, the robots have to know each other's relative poses, but estimating these at the start of operation puts a limit on real applications. In our study, the robots start the single SLAM with their own global coordinate, and merge their maps during the operation by detecting the overlapped region of their maps. The robots automatically recognize the occurrence of map overlapping by matching their current frame with the maps built by other robots. With the robust data association technique from the ceiling-vision based SLAM, the proposed algorithm robustly detects the overlapping regions and estimates the accurate transformations for map alignment. In our experiment, we have verified that our algorithm successfully enables the multi-robot SLAM without any initial correspondence or encounter of robots.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of optimal trajectory generation for a team of mobile robots tracking a moving target using distance and bearing measurements. Contrary to previous approaches, we explicitly consider limits on the robots' speed and impose constraints on the minimum distance at which the robots are allowed to approach the target. We first address the case of a single sensor and show that although this problem is non-convex with non-convex constraints, in general, its optimal solution can be determined analytically. Moreover, we extend this approach to the case of multiple sensors and propose an iterative algorithm, Gauss-Seidel-relaxation (GSR), for determining the set of feasible locations that each sensor should move to in order to minimize the uncertainty about the position of the target. Extensive simulation results are presented demonstrating that the performance of the GSR algorithm, whose computational complexity is linear in the number of sensors, is indistinguishable of that of a grid-based exhaustive search, with cost exponential in the number of sensors, and significantly better than that of a random, towards the target, motion strategy.",

        "abstract": "Exploration of an unknown environment is a fundamental concern in mobile robotics. This paper presents an approach for cooperative multi-robot exploration, fire searching and mapping in an unknown environment. The proposed approach aims to minimize the overall exploration time, making it possible to localize fire sources in an efficient way. In order to achieve this goal, the robots should cooperate in an effective way, so they can individually and simultaneously explore different areas of the environment while they identify fire sources. The proposed approach employs a decentralized frontier based exploration method which evaluates the cost-gain ratio to navigate to target way-points. The target way-points are obtained by an A* search variant algorithm. The potential field method is used to control the robots motion while avoiding obstacles. When a robot detects a fire, it estimates the flame's position by triangulation. The communication between the robots is done in a decentralized control way where they share the necessary data to generate the map of the environment and to perform cooperative actions in a behavioral decision making way. This paper presents simulation and experimental results of the proposed exploration and fire search method and concludes with a discussion of the obtained results and future improvements. 1",

Role/positioning assignment follows a new priority-based algorithm that maintains a competitive formation, covering the most important roles/positionings when malfunctions lead to a reduction of the team size. Coordinated procedures for passing and setplays have also been implemented. With this design, CAMBADA reached the 1st place in the RoboCup'2008 world championship.

First, we demonstrated fabrication of \u00bf10 - 500 \u00bfm arteriole and capillary vessel block models using photolithography. The circularity of fabricated \u00bf10, 50, and 500 \u00bfm microchannels were 84.0%, 61.5%, and 82.3%, respectively. Flow experiments demonstrated that these channels had no leakage. Next, we proposed a fabrication method for \u00bf100 - 500 \u00bfm arteriole membrane models, which connect larger membrane models and smaller block models. These models were prepared with grayscale lithography and a wax and PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) mixture material. The proposed approach overcame the brittleness of a previous sacrificial model fabricated by ink jet rapid prototyping. The membrane model had a circular cross section with a channel circularity of 90%. Finally, we succeeded in making transparent membranous and block arteriole model with which we can simulate blood circulation.",

Recharging is necessary before the power of the robot has exhausted. In this paper, we propose a multi-sensor fusing method using intensity and range data fusion with covariance intersection approach to locate the robot pose while performing the docking for recharging. An artificial landmark is employed as a visual cue on a docking station in order to recognize the location by using inverse perspective projection. At the same time, the range data acquired by laser range finder are modeled as multiple line segments which are the hypothetical walls in the environment. Then the geometrical relationship between the robot and the docking station is estimated much more precise by using covariance intersection approach. We have demonstrated the success of the proposed algorithms through experimental results.",

        "abstract": "When adults talk to infants they do that in a different way compared to how they communicate with other adults. This kind of infant directed speech (IDS) typically highlights target words using focal stress and utterance final position. Also, speech directed to infants often refers to objects, people and events in the world surrounding the infant. Because of this, the sound sequences the infant hears are very likely to co-occur with actual objects or events in the infant's visual field. In this work we present a model that is able to learn word-like structures from multimodal information sources without any pre-programmed linguistic knowlege, by taking advantage of the characteristics of IDS. The model is implemented on a humanoid robot platform and is able to extract word-like patterns and associating these to objects in the visual surrounding.",

Within rugged terrains where wheeled sensors are unsuitable, other types of mobile sensors, such as hopping sensors, are needed. In this paper, we address the problem of relocating hopping sensors to the sensing holes. Recent study for this problem considered moving sensors along the shortest path. The shortest path might be used repeatedly and therefore create other sensing holes. In order to overcome these weak nesses, we propose multipath-based schemes considering the balanced assignment for the relocation of hopping sensors. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes guarantee a more balanced migration distribution of efficient sensors and a higher movement success ratio of required sensors than those of the shortest path-based schemes.",

        "abstract": "An adaptive control using multiple incremental fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) is proposed for robot manipulators. The structure and parameters of the FNNs are determined dynamically by using an incremental FNN. By incorporating incremental learning and adaptive control with multiple models, the proposed method not only reduces complexity and computation induced by the use of multiple models, but also provides favorable transient and tracking performance. The multiple FNNs are switched or blended to improve the transient response when manipulating objects are changed. The parameters are refined adaptively to compensate for system uncertainties. The resulting closed-loop system with a switching or blending law is proven to be asymptotically stable. The proposed scheme is applied to control a two-link robot manipulator in conjunction with varying payloads.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We propose a robust and accurate method for multi-target geo-localization from airborne video. The difference between our approach and other approaches in the literature is fourfold: 1) it does not require gimbal control of the camera or any particular path planning control for the UAV; 2) it can instantaneously geolocate multiple targets even if they were not previously observed by the camera; 3) it does not require a geo-referenced terrain database nor an altimeter for estimating the UAV's and the target's altitudes; and 4) it requires only one camera, but it employs a multi-stereo technique using the image sequence for increased accuracy in target geo-location. The only requirements for our approach are: that the intrinsic parameters of the camera be known; that the on board camera be equipped with global positioning system (GPS) and inertial measurement unit (IMU); and that enough feature points can be extracted from the surroundings of the target. Since the first two constraints are easily satisfied, the only real requirement is regarding the feature points. However, as we explain later, this last constraint can also be alleviated if the ground is approximately planar. The result is a method that can reach a few meters of accuracy for an UAV flying at a few hundred meters above the ground. Such performance is demonstrated by computer simulation, in-scale data using a model city, and real airborne video with ground truth.",

Multiplicative potential energy function is used to form the overall desired shape of the entire swarm. The shape formed using this method is a union of all the regions defined by corresponding inequality functions. This proposed method is a complement to our previous method where the additive potential energy is used to form the desired shape. By combining the multiplicative and additive potential energies, a variety of complicated shapes can be formed. Lyapunov-like function is presented for convergence analysis of the multi-robot systems. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Many sensing applications require monitoring phenomena with complex spatio-temporal dynamics spread over large spatial domains. Efficient monitoring of such phenomena would require an impractically large number of static sensors; therefore, actuated sensing - mobile robots carrying sensors - is required. Path planning for these robots, i.e., deciding on a subset of locations to observe, is critical for high fidelity monitoring of expansive areas with complex dynamics. We propose MUST - a multiscale approach with stochastic modeling. MUST is a hierarchical approach that models the phenomena as a stochastic Gaussian process that is exploited to select a near-optimal subset of observation locations. We discuss in detail our proposed algorithm for the application of monitoring light intensity in a forest understory. We performed extensive empirical evaluations both in simulation using field data and on an actual cabled robotic system to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Particle filters have been widely used as a powerful optimization tool for nonlinear, non-Gaussian dynamic models such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and visual tracking. Particle filters, however, often suffer from particle impoverishment, which is caused by a mismatch between proposal distribution and target distribution. To solve this problem, we propose a new method to improve the efficiency of particle filters by employing the particle swarm optimization (PSO), which is a kind of swarm intelligence algorithm. The PSO, especially its variant for dynamic models, is combined with the generic particle filter to get samples that are well matched with target distribution. The resulting filter is applied to a vision based SLAM system and its performance is tested. We present experimental results that demonstrate improved accuracy in localization and mapping at the same or less computational cost than the conventional particle filters.",

Anonymity generates a combinatorial ambiguity in the inversion of the measure equations, leading to a multiplicity of admissible relative pose hypotheses. To solve the problem, we propose a two-stage localization system based on MultiReg, an innovative algorithm that computes on-line all the possible relative pose hypotheses, whose output is processed by a data associator and a multiple EKF to isolate and refine the best estimates. The performance of the mutual localization system is analyzed through experiments, proving the effectiveness of the method and, in particular, its robustness with respect to false positives (objects that look like robots) and false negatives (robots that are not detected) of the measure process.",

First, a standard experiment on this visual illusion is conducted by means of the most typical way so as to make sure that participants can experience this illusion; the result shows that all the subjects are deceived by the illusion figure as in many previous results. As the next step, the subjects are asked to physically trace one of three lines-normal line and lines with feathers of an arrow-with the same length displayed on an LCD. After a few traces, the line suddenly vanishes, and then the subjects retrace the invisible line based on only their memory and somatic sensations. During this task, we measure the trajectory of fingertip from a start to the goal using a motion capture system. The result indicates that the Muller-Lyer illusion dominantly affects the reaching task although the haptic/kinesthetic cue was also given just before the task. Thus, this result implies that the visual illusion affects the motion planning, which partly supports a planning-motion model.",

Dexterity of robotic manipulators can be achieved by equipping an anthropomorphic robot hand with multiple fingers. Additionally, in order to manipulate various tools that humans are using in daily life, the size and the exerting force of the robot hand should be similar to that humans are. In this paper, we proposed a human-sized multi-fingered robot hand with detachable mechanism at the wrist. The robot hand can be split at the wrist into the hand part and the actuator part. The fingers are driven by wires and are controlled by actuators embedded in the arm part. The driving force from the arm part is transmitted to the hand part by gear mechanism at the wrist. The developed robot hand has the size of 200[mm](length) \u00d7 78[mm](width) \u00d7 24.6[mm](thickness) and can exert 10[N] at the fingertip. The performance of the developed robot hand was shown by a motion control experiment.",

        "abstract": "A new convergence calculation method of the normal distributions transform (NDT) scan matching for high resolution of grid maps is proposed. NDT scan matching algorithm usually has a good effect on large grids, so it is difficult to generate the detailed map with small grids. The proposed method employs interactive closest point (ICP) algorithm to find corresponding point, and it also enlarges the convergence area by modifying the eigenvalue of normal distribution so that the evaluation value is driven effectively for the pairing data. In addition, outlier elimination process is implemented to the scanning for sub-grid scale object. The scanning data from laser range finder (LRF) have error but its set of detected small object can be clustered to determine the center of mass (CoM) and the outlier data. The outlier commonly locates behind true points and it can be eliminated when the robot observes from other point. Experimental result shows the effectiveness of the proposed convergence algorithm and outlier elimination method.",

        "abstract": "In order to allow severely disabled people who cannot move their arms and legs to steer an automated wheelchair, this work proposes the combination of a non-invasive EEG-based human-robot interface and an autonomous navigation system that safely executes the issued commands. The robust classification of steady-state visual evoked potentials in brain activity allows for the seamless projection of qualitative directional navigation commands onto a frequently updated route graph representation of the environment. The deduced metrical target locations are navigated to by the application of an extended version of the well-established nearness diagram navigation method. The applicability of the system proposed is demonstrated by a real-world pilot study in which eight out of nine untrained subjects successfully navigated an automated wheelchair, requiring only some ten minutes of preparation.",

Through the analysis of the closed-loop system, we make it clear that the hypothetical trajectory Chapman showed is a special dynamic solution of the closed-loop system. Moreover, using a motion-analyzing technique over a finite time, it is shown that the proposed feedback control laws make it possible to generate a pursuing trajectory automatically that a fly ball can be caught in the right place and at the right time. It is also shown that the pursuing trajectory gets closer to the one Chapman showed as a feedback gain increases. In addition, we compare the proposed feedback control laws with Proportional Navigation (PN) which is the most common navigation technique for tracking a moving target, and demonstrate that the proposed control laws perform better than PN.",

This robot aims to help to remove brain tumors and is incorporated into a multi-robot neurosurgical system. We focus especially on the resection task. The robot is composed of three serial bending modules actuated by wires (cables) and uses an additional translation. The redundancy of the robot (seven degrees of freedom) allows more dexterity for the resection task. A kinematic (geometric) model is built distinguishing the structure and the actuation models, and integrating the influence of the wires into the kinematic behaviour of the robot. A method for kinematic redundancy handling is defined and assigns different parts of the robot to different tasks. An interactive path planning based on arbitrary sequence of elementary procedures assembled by the neurosurgeon is proposed and the yielding procedures are computed from the kinematic model.",

The IMM is now a well known modular approach, which is based on the discretization of the vehicle evolution space into simple maneuvers, represented each by a simple dynamic model such as constant velocity or constant turning etc. This allows the method to be optimized for highly dynamic vehicles. Unfortunately classical IMM shows some drawbacks concerning some real time multi sensors applications. In this work, we focus on outdoor vehicle localization with asynchronous sensors in order to report these drawbacks and then propose a new solution. Many tests carried out with simulated and real data confirm the interest for using such a solution in our applications.",

Design of ankle joint which is considered one of the more compact with high power capacity and low weight is a big challenge. The very important role played by this joint during walking, makes its design and control the first step of having a robust walking biped. In this paper, a novel three dof hybrid mechanisms has been proposed. This mechanism is actuated hydraulically and uses cable technology for power transmission. The proposed solution fulfils the requirements induced by both geometrical and biomechanical constraints. At first, the geometrical and kinematics properties of the proposed solution have been developed. A simulation tool has been built using ADAMS software and used to carry out early design dimensioning of the several components. Singularity study is detailed showing the advantage of this new solution. Control method has been proposed and tested. Finally manufactured prototype of this solution is presented with preliminary results showing the performances of the mechanism. This mechanism is a part of an International patent accepted at INPI- France.",

        "abstract": "Living organisms have various kinds of flexibility and robustness which are realized by \u00bfyuragi,\u00bf i.e. biological fluctuations or noises. Bacterial motion is a form of noise-based motion, since bacteria can move towards a higher concentration of some chemical which they prefer even though they have only a limited 1-DOF of flagella for mobility. Bacteria also have only a limited sensory device which cannot detect the spatial gradient of the chemical at a time. The simple strategies that bacteria take to realize chemotaxis are (1) to tumble (or turn) to change orientation randomly with unbundled flagella in various directions being hit by surrounding water molecules, and (2) to change the frequency of tumbling according as the time change of chemical concentration. In this paper, we describe a small and simple, 1-DOF swimming robot developed by mimicking the bacterial motion generation mechanism. The robot only has a single motor and a single sensor (a photo detector), however, by changing its orientation in response to various noises which exist in the environment, and by changing the frequency of turning, the robot can approach its goal. Experimental results indicate that the robot statistically approaches the goal (a light source) in two dimensional space with its 1-DOF actuator, which would be impossible for the robot to achieve without utilizing noises in the environment.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a method for removing adherent noises from image sequences. In outdoor environments, it is often the case that scenes taken by a camera are deteriorated because of adherent noises such as waterdrops on the surface of the lens-protecting glass of the camera. To solve this problem, our method takes advantage of image sequences captured with a moving camera whose motion is unknown. Our method estimates a camera motion only from image sequences, and makes a spatio-temporal image to extract the regions of adherent noises by examining differences of track slopes in cross section images between adherent noises and other objects. Finally, regions of noises are eliminated by replacing with image data corresponding to object regions. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.",

The performance metrics of the hexagonal lattice in 2D and the face centred and body centred cubic lattices in 3D are investigated and compared to their square and cubic counterparts. It is found that quantization to alternative lattices yields some improvements. Ultimately, the D3 or face centred cubic lattice is highlighted for its lower quantization error, lower rotation variability and higher order rotational symmetry. It has three times less occupied voxel count pose variability than a standard cubic occupied voxel list. These improvements have implications for SLAM and path planning.",

With reference to the VSA-II prototype, we present a feedback linearization approach that allows the simultaneous decoupling and accurate tracking of motion and stiffness reference profiles. The operative condition that avoids control singularities is characterized. Moreover, a momentum-based collision detection scheme is introduced, which does not require joint torque sensing nor information on the time-varying stiffness of the device. Based on the residual signal, a collision reaction strategy is presented that takes advantage of the proposed nonlinear control to rapidly let the arm bounce away after detecting the impact, while limiting contact forces through a sudden reduction of the stiffness. Simulations results are reported to illustrate the performance and robustness of the overall approach. Extensions to the multidof case of robot manipulators equipped with VSA-II devices are also considered.",

Sensing is local: there are three fixed beacons at known locations, so distance and position estimates propagate across multiple robots. We show that the technique of Nonparametric Belief Propagation (NBP), a graph-based generalization of particle filtering, can address this problem and model multi-modal and ring-shaped uncertainty distributions. NBP provides the basis for distributed algorithms in which messages are exchanged between local neighbors. Generalizing previous approaches to localization in static sensor networks, we improve efficiency and accuracy by using a dynamics model for temporal tracking. We compare the NBP dynamic tracking algorithm with SMCL+R, a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm. Whereas NBP currently requires more computation, it converges in more cases and provides estimates that are 3 to 4 times more accurate. NBP also facilitates probabilistic models of sensor accuracy and network connectivity.",

Starting from the analysis of the human lower limbs, we figure out that 6 DOF per leg are fundamental for a correct walking motion and can be adopted in a mechanical design of a humanoid robot. A close investigation of the joints leads us to a novel modular mechanical design, with a parallel architecture mechanism characterized by and high degree of interchangeable components. The robot is using twelve high performance hollow shaft electrical actuators acting in pairs in a parallel manner, a remote compact and transparent actuation with zero-backlash cable transmissions, 2 DOF differential joints between each segment of the limb and a light-weight carbon fiber skeleton modeling and mimic the anatomy of the human legs. The modular 2 DOF cable differential joint has been implemented at the hip, knee and ankle level. Using our approach, actuation is more transparent (back-drivable, with low inertia) and will allow SHERPA to interact with the environment more smoothly which leads to better walking ability.",

Similar to the architecture previously proposed in, the controllers allow interaction between both users, the trainee and the trainer, as well as between the users and the virtual slave robot and environment. However, the newly proposed architectures provide increased maneuverability and enhanced sense of environment to the users. The kinesthetic performance of the proposed control architectures are analyzed under different operating conditions. Furthermore, the architectures are implemented on a dual-user haptic simulation testbed for user study experiments to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed architectures in terms of sense of environment, maneuverability, and guidance.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an efficient method for retrieving the 3-dimensional shape associated to novelties in the environment of an autonomous robot, which is equipped with a laser range finder. First, changes are detected over the point clouds using a combination of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and the earth mover's distance (EMD) algorithms. Next, the shape retrieval is achieved using two different algorithms. First, new samplings are generated from each Gaussian function, followed by a random sampling consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to retrieve geometric primitives. Furthermore, a new algorithm is developed to directly retrieve the shape according to the mathematical space of Gaussian mixture. In this paper, the set of geometric primitives has been limited to the set C = {sphere, cylinder, plane}. The two shape retrieval methods are compared in terms of computational cost and accuracy. Experimental results in various real and simulated scenarios demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an object dynamics virtualization that enables a human operator to handle the object easy for a given task by changing dynamics of the object by a robot assistance. The proposed method uses a force sensor fixed between an end effector of the manipulator and an object to measure force/torque applied by the manipulator to the object. Then, force/torque applied by an operator are estimated by using a disturbance observer, which subtracts the sensing force/torque from those calculated based on the object acceleration. Using the force sensor makes implementation easier by isolating the object dynamics from those of the manipulator. By using a virtual internal model driven by the estimated force/torque, a task-oriented mechanical impedance is given to the object that is in reality heavy and unbalanced as if it were lighter and well-balanced. Experiments to virtualize dynamics of a rod with a weight at one end, i.e., an example of an unbalanced object, to be a uniform disc by a SCARA manipulator with three degrees-of-freedom were conducted, and the results showed the validity of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel approach for identifying objects using touch sensors installed in the finger tips of a manipulation robot. Our approach operates on low-resolution intensity images that are obtained when the robot grasps an object. We apply a bag-of-words approach for object identification. By means of unsupervised clustering on training data, our approach learns a vocabulary from tactile observations which is used to generate a histogram codebook. The histogram codebook models distributions over the vocabulary and is the core identification mechanism. As the objects are larger than the sensor, the robot typically needs multiple grasp actions at different positions to uniquely identify an object. To reduce the number of required grasp actions, we apply a decision-theoretic framework that minimizes the entropy of the probabilistic belief about the type of the object. In our experiments carried out with various industrial and household objects, we demonstrate that our approach is able to discriminate between a large set of objects. We furthermore show that using our approach, a robot is able to distinguish visually similar objects that have different elasticity properties by using only the information from the touch sensor.",

        "abstract": "Scanning laser range sensors (ladars) are frequently used in mobile robotics applications because their ability to accurately measure the environment in 3D makes them well-suited for perception tasks like terrain modeling and obstacle detection. The choice of ladar sensor and the manner in which it is configured and integrated into a robot platform is usually determined subjectively based on the experience of the project team members. This paper develops a method for evaluating ladar sensors and sensor configurations that objectively measures the quality of a sensor/configuration choice in terms of density and uniformity of measurements within a region of interest. The method is applicable to static sensors and environments as well as scenarios with moving objects and mobile sensors. It can be used to compare different sensors, to evaluate specific sensor configurations and search for the optimal one, and to aid in designing new ladar sensors tailored to specific applications. We find that popular ladar configurations are often not the best configuration choice, and that alternative configurations not commonly used would offer better data density and uniformity.",

We call such a map making environment information summarization because how to summarize may change depending on the purpose of the map. Environment information summarization usually includes searching for specified objects in the environment. It is, therefore, crucial to make a good observation plan for efficient summarization. We develop an observation planning method which uses object appearance models for appropriately handling a trade-off between visual data quality and vision cost. Experimental results using a vision-based humanoid robot show the effectiveness of the proposed planning method.",

        "abstract": "Locating all obstacles around a moving robot and classifying them as stable obstacles or not by a sensor such as an omnidirectional camera are essential for the robot's smooth movement and avoiding problems in calibrating many cameras. However, there are few works on locating and classifying all obstacles around a robot while it is moving by only one omnidirectional camera. In order to locate obstacles, we regard floor boundary points where robots can measure the distance from the robot by one omnidirectional camera as obstacles. Tracking them, we can classify obstacles by comparing the movement of each tracked point with odometry data. Moreover, our method changes a threshold to detect the points based on the result of comparing in order to enhance classification. The classification ratio of our method is 85.0%, which is four times higher than that of a method without changing a parameter to detect the points.",

These constraints, introduced through measurements and motion prediction, produce a bending effect in the event of closing a large loop. In this paper we present a discussion of the bending problem for trajectory based representations. Furthermore, we propose a generic approach to reduce the bending effect that exploits common geometrical constraints in human-made environments through the use of a heading based curvature measurement. We show by means of experimental results that our approach increases significantly both the global and local map accuracy.",

This new strategy is advised based on a thorough consistency analysis and aims to improve the process consistency while reducing the computational cost. At first, three different possible observation models are introduced for the EKF-SLAM solution for a robot equipped with a bearing-range sensor. General form of the covariance matrix and the level of inconsistency in the robot orientation estimate is then calculated for these variants, and based on the numerical comparison of the estimation results, it is proposed to use the bearing and range information of a feature in the initialization step of EKF-SLAM. However, it is recommended to use only the bearing information to perform other iteration steps. The simulation observations verify that the new strategy yields to more consistent estimates both for the robot and the features. Moreover, through the proposed consistency analysis, it is shown that since the source of consistency improvement is independent from the choice of the motion model, it gives us an advantage over other existing methods that assume a specific motion models for consistency improvement.",

We notice that the vertical edges from high buildings and poles of street lights are a very stable set of features that can be easily extracted. Thus, we develop a monocular vision-based odometry system that utilizes the vertical edges from the scene to estimate the robot ego-motion. Since it only takes a single vertical line pair to estimate the robot ego-motion on the road plane, here we model the ego-motion estimation process and analyze how the choice of different vertical line pair impacts the accuracy of the ego-motion estimation process. The resulting closed form error model can assist to choose an appropriate pair of vertical lines to reduce the error in computation. We have implemented the proposed method and validated the error analysis results in physical experiments.",

        "abstract": "For several decades now, the robotics industry has postulated the emergence of a new breed of manipulators capable of safely interacting with humans. The integration of robots into human environments has always possessed a unique set of challenges. The primary concern has always been for the safety of the human coworkers. Insuring their safety has led to the desire to design manipulators with intrinsic safety characteristics. Specifically, it is noted that modern `human-safe' manipulators are successful if they have minimized both their weight and reflected actuator inertia. The leading research accomplishing this relies on complex actuation systems. Such systems commonly suffer from degraded performance and high cost of development. Magneto- and electro-rheological fluids are a class of smart-materials that can instantaneously, and reversibly alter their rheological properties under the influence of an applied field. Devices developed with such fluids are known to possess superior torque-to-inertia characteristics over conventional servo systems. Moreover, their simple mechanical construction suggests that manipulators using such devices could be developed at a lower cost. In this paper, we will discuss the potential benefits rheological fluids can bring to the field of human friendly manipulators.",

Our approach uses Pythagorean Hodograph (PH) curves to connect vertices of the tree, which makes it possible to generate paths for which the main kinematic constraints of the vehicle are not violated. The smoothness of the acceleration profile of the vehicle is indirectly guaranteed between two vertices of the RRT tree. The proposed algorithm provides fast convergence to the final trajectory. We still utilize the properties of the RRT to avoid collisions with static obstacles of a environment. We show results for a small unmanned aerial vehicles in environments with different configurations.",

In doing so, the significance of perspective distortion both for camera calibration and for pose estimation is revealed. Since narrow angular field of view cameras make it difficult to obtain rich images in terms of perspectivity, the accuracy of the calibration results is expectedly low. From this, we propose an alternative method that compensates for this loss by utilizing the pose readings of a robotic manipulator. It facilitates accurate pose estimation by nonlinear optimization, minimizing reprojection errors and errors in the manipulator transformations at the same time. Accurate pose estimation in turn enables accurate parametrization of a perspective camera.",

In general, the employed projections are user-defined, and to the authors' knowledge, automatically computing them has not yet been investigated. In this work, the feasibility of offline-computed random linear projections is evaluated within the context of a state-of-the art sampling-based motion planning algorithm. For systems with moderate dimension, random linear projections seem to outperform human intuition. For more complex systems it is likely that non-linear projections would be better suited.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "For ground vehicle localization, hybrid-GNSS localizers now use commonly dead-reckoning sensors, like odometers or inertial units. They are designed to increase the accuracy, the integrity and the availability of the localization information, particularly in areas where the satellite signals are subject to outages and multipaths. In this paper, a data-fusion method is proposed to take benefits of 2D navigable road-maps in a tightly-coupled approach. In such a problem, 3D modeling is mandatory to process the pseudo-range information of the satellites. Our proposal is to use a 2D map as a heading measure in a Earth tangential frame. This is called \u00bfmap-aided odometry\u00bf. A Kalman filter, gating the normalized innovation signals, is applied to merge the redundant exteroceptive information in a cautious way. Experimental results are reported to quantify the performance gain of the proposed approach relying on the map-aided technique. We show that this fusion scheme increases the accuracy and the availability of the provided localization specially in GNSS-challenging environments.",

The arbitrary shape objects are made of the photo-crosslinkable resin on the microchip under a microscope. The polymerized micro-objects, which we call as \u00bfMicrotools\u00bf, can be used for the single cell analysis. The microtools are fabricated at the desired place on the microchip in less than 1 second. Additionally, the microtools are manipulated by optical tweezers. By high-speed scanning of a single laser with galvanometer mirror, it is able to manipulate multiple points simultaneously. Using this technique, the rotational microstructure composed of the rotation axis and the microgear is assembled and rotated. We propose the two method of microstructure assembly. The assembled rotational microstructure is evaluated about the rotation speed depending on the laser power.",

Autonomous electric vehicles in free-access can be seen as an attractive approach, in view of the large flexibility that can be expected. One instrumental functionality linked to this solution is platoon motion: several autonomous vehicles accurately follow the trajectory of a manually driven first vehicle, with pre-specified inter-distances. A global decentralized platoon control strategy, supported by inter-vehicle communications and relying on nonlinear control techniques is here proposed. Each vehicle is controlled with respect to the same smooth reference trajectory, inferred on-line from the motion of the first vehicle via B-spline optimization. Experimental results, carried out with four urban vehicles, demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach.",

Inspired from content-based image retrieval, an efficient approach is the use of visual vocabularies for measuring similarities between images. In this way, images corresponding to the same scene region can be associated. The state of the art proposals that address this topic suffer from two main drawbacks: (i) they require heavy user intervention, generally involving trial and error tasks for training and parameter tuning and (ii) they are suitable for batch processing only, where all the data is readily available before data processing. We propose a novel method for visual vocabulary navigation and mapping that overcomes these shortcomings. First, the vocabularies are built and updated online, during robot navigation, in order to efficiently represent the visual information present in the scene. Also, the vocabulary building process does not require any user intervention.",

The measured data are the noisy image plane coordinates of object match taken from image in the sequence. Image plane noise levels are allowed and investigated.

The proposed complete coverage algorithm abstracts the environment as a union of robot-sized cells and then uses a spiral filling rule. It can be largely classified as an approximate cellular decomposition approach as defined by Choset. In this paper, we first propose a special map coordinate assignment scheme based on active wall-finding using the history of sensor readings, which can drastically reduce the number of turns on the generated coverage path. Next, we develop an efficient path planner to link the simple spiral paths using the constrained inverse distance transform that we introduced the first time. This planner selects the next target cell which is at the minimal path length away from the current cell among the remaining non-contiguous uncovered cells while at the same time, finding the path to this target to save both the memory and time which are important concern in embedded robotics. Experiments on both simulated and real cleaning robots demonstrate the practical efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous robot navigation is becoming an increasingly important research topic for mobile robots. In the last few years, significant progress has been made towards stable robotic bipedal walking. This is creating an increased research interest in developing autonomous navigation strategies which are tailored specifically to humanoid robots. Efficient approaches to perception and motion planning, which are suited to the unique characteristics of biped humanoid robots and their typical operating environments, are receiving special interest. In this paper, we present a time-efficient motion planning system for a Fujitsu HOAP-2 humanoid robot. The sampling based algorithm is used to provide the robot with minimal free configuration space which is sampled to extract the robot path. For collision detection, a cylinder model is used to approximate the trajectory for the body center of the humanoid robot during navigation. It calculates the actual distances required to execute different actions of the robot and compares them with the distances to the nearest obstacles. The A* search algorithm is then implemented to find smooth and low-cost footstep placements of the humanoid robot within the resulting configuration space. The proposed hybrid algorithm reduces searching time and produces a smoother path for the humanoid robot at a low cost.",

        "abstract": "A nonlinear reference shaping method for manipulators which are operated in living environments is proposed. It generates an intermediate reference position, and it is combined with a control based on the virtual spring-damper hypothesis proposed by Arimoto et al. The initial acceleration is moderated by an intermediate reference position inserted between the original target and the current position of the manipulator's endpoint and by a second-order-lag filter. The endpoint position is fed back to the proposed controller to prevent from excessive trailing force and large acceleration. As the result, human-like smooth reaching motions and pliant behaviors against external forces are achieved. The validity of the proposed method is shown through computer simulations on a planar 4-DOF manipulator.",

        "abstract": "Traditional bilateral teleoperation communicates both motion and force information explicitly between master and slave devices. Any such closed loop architecture trades off performance with potential instability, especially when using force measurements of high inertia slaves contacting stiff environments. More conservatively, open-loop architectures avoid stability issues, transmitting motion commands while allowing any force feedback only via sensory substitution. We propose open-loop bilateral teleoperation as an alternative communicating force information explicitly and restricting motion information to visual feedback. This naturally matches a user's needs, seeing motion and feeling forces. A user study was conducted to compare the novel user interface to three common open loop and bilateral control methods: position control, position control with force feedback, and rate control. The results of this study show that users are able to achieve superior force tracking with little tremor. Position tracking and trial completion time suffered from the lack of direct position connection, but training provides a promising method to restore this performance.",

        "abstract": "Optical flow sensing techniques are promising for obstacle avoidance, distance regulation, and moving target tracking, particularly for small mobile robots with limited power and payload constraints. Most optical flow sensing experimental work has been done on mobile platforms which are relatively steady in rotation, unlike the pitching motion expected on flapping wing flyers. In order to assess the feasibility of using optical flow to control an indoor flapping flyer, an 7 gram commercially available ornithopter airframe was equipped with on-board camera and CPU module with mass of 2.5 grams and 2.6 gram battery. An experiment was conducted capturing optical flow information during flapping and gliding flight on the same platform. As expected, flapping introduced substantial systematic bias to the direction estimates to the point of flipping the true direction periodically. Nonetheless, since the optical flow results oscillated at the same frequency as the flapping wings, it is envisioned that one could disambiguate the jittering optic flow measurements by correlating these with real-time feedback from the motor current.",

A state machine is proposed as a solution to equip the UAV with all reactions necessary for indoor navigation.

        "abstract": "Many motion support robots of the elderly and disable were studies all over the world. We have developed the rollover support system, which is one of the ADL. Our ultimate goal is to develop an effective rollover support system for patients with cancer bone metastasis. The core of this system is a pneumatic rubber muscle that is operated by EMG signals from the trunk muscle. A Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) is the traditional method for recognizing EMG signals. However, response delay and false recognition are the problem of the traditional neural network. We previously proposed a new neural network, called the Micro-Macro Neural Network (MMNN), to recognize the rollover movement earlier and with more accuracy than is possible with TDNN. MMNN is composed of a Micro Part, which detects rapid changes in the strength of the EMG signal, and a Macro Part, which detects the tendency of the EMG signal to continually increase or decrease. However, the methodology to determine the structure of the MMNN was not established. In this paper, the optimal structure of the MMNN is determined. A comparison of each of the 360 sets of test times of MMNN versus TDNN was done. These results showed that recognition using MMNN is 40 (msec) (S.D. 49) faster than recognition using TDNN. Additionally, the number of false recognitions using MMNN is one-third of that using TDNN. By comparing the output using only the Micro part and Macro part in MMNN, it was found that the combination of quick response of the Micro part and stable recognition of the Macro part are advantages of MMNN. In the future, we plan to test the effectiveness of the total system in clinical tests with cancer patients in terminal care.",

Inaccuracies their value generate errors in the motion analysis, misleading the interpretation of results. No systematic method to estimate them has been proposed so far. Rather, parameters are scaled from generic tables or estimated with methods inappropriate for in-patient care. Based on our previous works, we propose a real-time software and its interface that allow to estimate the whole-body segment parameters, and to visualize the progresses of the completion of the identification. The visualization is used as a visual feedback to optimize the excitation and thus the identification results. The method is experimentally tested and obtained results are discussed.",

The method presented here builds on a problem formulation as a mixed-integer program considering time-varying constraints resulting from moving obstacles, as well as state and input constraints depending on the region of the work space.

        "abstract": "We address the problem of choosing adequate contact forces to ensure the stability of a multi-fingered grasp in face of external disturbances of unknown intensity. The contact forces we look for are tightening, pre-strain forces rather than active, direction-related blocking forces. We compute such tightening forces, together with blocking forces and a lower-bound approximation of an existing grasp quality measure, in only one linear programming problem. The tightening forces ensure robustness to the largest-minimum resisted disturbance wrench, but a variety of optimal contact forces may be further computed from the desired robustness by solving a quadratic programming problem.",

        "abstract": "Parametric excitation walking is one of methods that realize a passive dynamic like walking on the level ground. In parametric excitation walking, up-and-down motion of the center of mass restores mechanical energy and sustainable gait is generated. Walking ability and walking performance strongly depend on the reference trajectory of the center of mass. In this paper, we propose an optimization method for the reference trajectory of parametric excitation walking. There are two problems for optimization. One is that search space of a reference trajectory is inherently infinite dimensional. Another is that it takes long simulation time to generate steady gait for a given reference trajectory. Therefore, the proposing optimization method adopts the following strategy. For the former, we confine the reference trajectory to the quartic spline curve and take the parameter of spline curve as decision variables. For the latter, we discretize the search space and adopt a local search method usually used in combinational optimization problems. We apply the proposed method to a kneed biped robot, and optimize the reference trajectory of its swing leg.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for sequencing a set of robotic tasks in an optimal way. Tasks description and execution are based on the task-function approach, which enables to build complex whole-body behaviors from local control laws. A naive solution to this problem would be to schedule the execution of the tasks sequentially, avoiding concurrency. This solution does not exploit full robot capabilities such as redundancy and have poor performance in terms of execution time or energy. However, reasoning on concurrent tasks is difficult while accounting for all the physical constraints of the robot. Our contribution is to determine the time-optimal realization of the mission taking into account robotic constraints that may be as complex as collision avoidance. Our approach achieves more than a simple scheduling; its originality lies in maintaining the task approach in the formulated optimization of the task sequencing problem. This theory is exemplified through a complete experiment on the real HRP-2 robot.",

The algorithm allows registering directly raw noisy data, possibly with the presence of outliers, without any pre-processing, such as filtering, denoising, or reconstruction. Region correspondence is found using similarity function based on the comparison of regions pdf and under geometry constraints. Results on raw scan data sets are presented to illustrate and evaluate the algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Identifying planetary soil parameters is not only an important scientific goal, but also necessary for exploration rover to optimize its control strategy and realize high-fidelity simulation. An improved wheel-soil interaction mechanics model is introduced, and it is then simplified by linearizing the normal stress and shearing stress to derive closed-form analytical equations. Eight unknown soil parameters are divided into three groups. The highly complicated coupled equations, each of which includes all the unknown soil parameters, are then decoupled. Each decoupled equation contains one or two groups of soil parameters, making it feasible to make a step-by-step identification of all the unknown parameters that characterize the soil. Wheel-soil interaction experiments were performed for six kinds of wheels with different dimensions and wheel lugs on simulated planetary soil. Soil parameters are identified with the measured data to validate the method, which are then used to predict wheel-soil interaction forces and torque, with a less than 10% margin of error. The improved model, decoupled analytical model, and soil-characterizing method can play important roles in the development of both the planetary exploration rovers and the terrestrial vehicles.",

Firstly, we present Position/ Limited Stress control to achieving both precise positioning and prevention of overload. FEM based organ model was used to estimate the stress in this control method. Secondly, we describe the control parameter setting method. The control parameter was set to realize sufficient performance within the range of stiffness variation. Finally, we carried out a numerical simulation and an in vitro experiment. The simulation result suggests that our control method and parameter setting method helps prevent stress overload, not depending on the stiffness of organ model. The in vitro experimental result suggests that our method helps prevent stress overload of the in vitro-liver, the stiffness parameter of which is unknown.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a basic passive vs. aggressive defense model, and analyzes it in terms of defense strategies against an intelligent enemy. In response to varying combinations of passive and aggressive defense, we assume that the enemy can up- or down-regulate recruitment activity. This leads to a differential game formulation of battle scenarios that we analyze for a warfare situation. Specifically, we consider military counterterrorist activities in a civilian population. Simulation results, including uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, are provided to demonstrate the benefits and limitations of the proposed model in terms of understanding army defense plans.",

Agent trajectories are developed that specifically take into account the fact that data collected will be used for near real-time assimilation with large predictive models. This aspect of the problem has significant implications because the trajectories generated are very different from those which do not take the assimilation step into account, and their performance in controlling error is notably better.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel planner for manipulators and robots in changing environments. When environments are complicated, it's always difficult to find a completely valid path solution, which is essential for many methods. However, our planner searches for several path segments to make robot move towards its goal as much as possible even though such a complete solution doesn't exist currently. In the learning phase, the planner begins by building a roadmap that captures the topological structure of the configuration space in a workspace without obstacles. In the query phase, the planner searches for a solution path in the roadmap with the A* algorithm and performs roadmap updating using the lazy evaluation idea concurrently with the solution search process. If a completely valid solution is found, it will be adopted immediately. Otherwise the planner will collect a set of maximum valid path segments and then select the optimal one for planning in the execution process. The searching and execution process will be repeatedly performed until a goal configuration is reached. In plentiful experiments, our planner shows promising performances.",

The force, if not controlled properly, may damage to the cells or even lead to death of the cells. The current cellular force measurement is limited by the inherent cantilever structure of the sensor, which may not be applicable to a practical cell injection system. In this paper, a simply supported beam structure based PVDF force sensor is first presented. The proportion relation is established between the penetration force and the sensor output after compensation. Using the designed force sensor, the force applied on the cell can be measured, and a force control based cell injection system is constructed. The experimental results performed on zebrafish embryos demonstrate the effectiveness of the micro force sensor and the force based control framework.",

In [1], the authors introduced how to discover, if a robot at configuration q at a future time t is guaranteed collision-free or not using the novel concept of the dynamic envelope and atomic obstacles based on sensing in such an unknown and unpredictable environment. In this paper, we further show that if a point (q; t) in the robot's configuration-time space (CT-space) is discovered collision-free, a neighborhood (CT-region) of (q; t) is also guaranteed collision-free. Based on that, given a continuous robot trajectory, we present a method to compute a set of discrete CT-points such that, if these points are discovered to be guaranteed collision-free, their associated collision-free neighborhood CT-regions contains the continuous trajectory, i.e., the trajectory is guaranteed continuously collision-free.",

This paper presents both a method for comparison of visual SLAM performance using several different feature extractors and the first experimental study using this method. Possible evaluation metrics are discussed and consistency testing and accumulated uncertainty are chosen to measure performance. Three feature extractors commonly used for visual SLAM are examined: the Harris corner detector, the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi tracker, and the scale-invariant feature transform. All three are found to perform similarly in an indoor test environment, close to or within the limits of measurement. A modest scale change is handled without difficulty. We conclude that feature extractor choice is not significant in terms of visual SLAM performance and other criteria may be used to make the selection.",

Persuasion can be generally defined as an attempt to change another's beliefs or behavior. The act of influencing others is fundamental to nearly every type of social interaction. Any agent desiring to seamlessly operate in a social manner will need to incorporate this type of core human behavior. As in human interaction, myriad aspects of a humanoid robot's appearance and behavior can significantly alter its persuasiveness - this work will focus on one particular factor: gender. In the current study, run at the Museum of Science in Boston, subjects interacted with a humanoid robot whose gender was varied. After a short interaction and persuasive appeal, subjects responded to a donation request made by the robot, and subsequently completed a post-study questionnaire. Findings showed that men were more likely to donate money to the female robot, while women showed little preference. Subjects also tended to rate the robot of the opposite sex as more credible, trustworthy, and engaging. In the case of trust and engagement the effect was much stronger between male subjects and the female robot. These results demonstrate the importance of considering robot and human gender in the design of HRI.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A phoneme-acquisition system was developed using a computational model that explains the developmental process of human infants in the early period of acquiring language. There are two important findings in constructing an infant's acquisition of phonemes: (1) an infant's vowel like cooing tends to invoke utterances that are imitated by its caregiver, and (2) maternal imitation effectively reinforces infant vocalization. Therefore, we hypothesized that infants can acquire phonemes to imitate their caregivers' voices by trial and error, i. e., infants use self-vocalization experience to search for imitable and unimitable elements in their caregivers' voices. On the basis of this hypothesis, we constructed a phoneme acquisition process using interaction involving vowel imitation between a human and an infant model. Our infant model had a vocal tract system, called the Maeda model, and an auditory system implemented by using mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) through STRAIGHT analysis. We applied recurrent neural network with parametric bias (RNNPB) to learn the experience of self-vocalization, to recognize the human voice, and to produce the sound imitated by the infant model. To evaluate imitable and unimitable sounds, we used the prediction error of the RNNPB model. The experimental results revealed that as imitation interactions were repeated, the formants of sounds imitated by our system moved closer to those of human voices, and our system could self-organize the same vowels in different continuous sounds. This suggests that our system can reflect the process of phoneme acquisition.",

        "abstract": "This paper concerns the whole physiological parameters identification of a musculoskeletal model of a human subject. The patient is equipped with an implanted Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) system as part of the SUAW's European project. The biomechanical model represents the knee and its associated muscles. The identification protocol is noninvasive and based on the in-vivo experimental data acquisition of a Spinal Cord Injured (SCI) patient. However, the human noninvasive identification poses problems of inaccessibility to some data. The identification procedure consists of several steps, in order to identify: the anthropometrical parameters, the geometrical parameters, the joint mechanical parameters, the force-length relationship and the recruitment function. Up to now, only the quadriceps muscle is considered with the knee joint in the identification procedure. A cross-validation has been done using data set not used during the identification process. The identified model shows a satisfactory response comparing to the measured knee response, which is obtained by stimulating the quadriceps through the implanted FES system. In this work, knee model-parameters of the implanted subject were identified successfully using the noninvasive identification procedure.",

        "abstract": "Applications of the conventional atomic force microscope (AFM) succeeded in manipulating nanoparticles, nanowires or nanotubes by widely used pushing or pulling operations on a single plane. However, pick-and-place nanomanipulation is still a challenge in the air. In this paper, a modified AFM, called three-dimensional (3D) manipulation force microscope (3DMFM) was developed, aiming to achieve the pick-and-place in the air. This system mainly consists of two microcantilevers and each is quipped with a nanopositioning device and an optical lever, constructing a nanotweezer with capabilities of picking and releasing nanoobjects with force sensing. Before the 3D manipulation, one of the cantilevers is employed to position nanoobjects and locate the tip of another cantilever by image scanning, then these two cantilevers fit together as a nanotweezer to grasp, transport and place the nanoobjects with real-time force sensing. In pick-and-place experiments, silicon nanowires (SiNMs) with different diameters were manipulated and 3D nanowire crosses were achieved. 3D nanomanipulation and nanoassembly in the air could become feasible through the newly developed 3DMFM.",

This paper presents a towel picking task with a multi-fingered hand by assigning different primitive actions to fingers. In this paper, we describe the towel picking task by a series of primitive actions applied to the towel. Experimental results are given, and we also show that the specification of a hand for the towel picking can be derived by analyzing the primitive actions assigned to the fingers. By describing a grasping and manipulation task with primitive actions, it can be used with other type of robot hands.",

Since the curvature of an object contour with an arbitrary curve is variable according to the change of the contact point between the object surface and the rigid finger tip, the arclength paremeter \u201cs\u201d explicitly appears in the overall fingers-object dynamics. It is shown that the overall fingers-object system should be accompanied with the first-order differential equation of the parameter \u201cs\u201d that includes the curvatures of both the object contour and finger-tip curve. A control input, which is of the same category as the control input called \u201cblind grasping\u201d appeared in our former papers, is utilized for the realization of stable grasp. The control input does neither need to use the kinematic information of the object nor use any external sensing. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out in order to confirm the effectiveness of our proposed model and control input.",

In the case of soccer robots, the kicking motion is usually a benchmark motion, computed off-line, without taking into account the current position of the robot or the direction of the goal. Moreover, robots must react quickly to any situation, even if not expected, and cannot spend time to generate a new optimal motion by the classical way. Therefore, we propose a new method for fast motion re-planning based on an off-line computation of a feasible sub-set of the motion parameters, using Interval Analysis.",

The system uses a probabilistic roadmap to satisfy the constraints imposed by the command interface of typical industrial manipulators and uses dynamic collision checking to ensure collision-free motion. In the context of a task monitored by a camera, we enhance a probabilistic roadmap with a dynamic occlusion checking algorithm that is able to determine which pixels of the camera are occluded by the robot during each motion segment. The occlusion algorithm is formulated as collision algorithm where the field of view of the camera is represented as a quadtree of frustums. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated in industrial bin picking simulations where the gripper must not occlude the targeted object throughout the task.",

In this paper, we explore motion planning for \u00bffireworks\u00bf needle insertion in 3D environments by developing an algorithm based on Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs). Given a set of targets, we propose an algorithm to quickly explore the configuration space by building a forest of RRTs and to find feasible plans for multiple steerable needles from a single entry region. We present two path selection algorithms with different optimality considerations to optimize the final plan among all feasible outputs. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm with a simulation based on a prostate cancer treatment environment.",

This paper proposes a learning framework which can dynamically change the planning space depending on the structure of tasks. Synchronous motion information is utilized to generate modes and different modes correspond to different hierarchical structure of the controller. This enables efficient task planning and control using low-dimensional space. An object manipulation task is tested as an application, where an object is found and used as a tool (or as a part of the body) to extend the ability of the robot. The proposed framework is expected to be a basic learning model to account for body image acquisition including tool affordances.",

This spool-like small and light mobile robot can be easily carried and remotely controlled by means of a laptop-sized tele-operator. It contains the following functional units: a camera to capture the fire site; sensors to gather temperature data, CO gas, and O2 concentrations; and a microphone with speaker for emergency voice communications between firefighter and victims.

This method estimates human pose by using these features in the Bayesian filtering framework. Moreover, we develop a new particle filter framework with two transition models and two resampling steps.

This new visual servoing scheme allows knowing the real world path performed by the robot without the computational load introduced by position-based approaches. A state-estimated feedback control law is designed to solve a tracking problem for the lateral and longitudinal robot coordinates. The desired trajectories to be tracked ensure total correction of both position and orientation using a single control law, even though the orientation is a DOF in the control system.

        "abstract": "This paper reports the application of vision based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) to the problem of autonomous ship hull inspection by an underwater vehicle. The goal of this work is to automatically map and navigate the underwater surface area of a ship hull for foreign object detection and maintenance inspection tasks. For this purpose we employ a pose-graph SLAM algorithm using an extended information filter for inference. For perception, we use a calibrated monocular camera system mounted on a tilt actuator so that the camera approximately maintains a nadir view to the hull. A combination of SIFT and Harris features detectors are used within a pairwise image registration framework to provide camera-derived relative-pose constraints (modulo scale). Because the ship hull surface can vary from being locally planar to highly three-dimensional (e.g., screws, rudder), we employ a geometric model selection framework to appropriately choose either an essential matrix or homography registration model during image registration. This allows the image registration engine to exploit geometry information at the early stages of estimation, which results in better navigation and structure reconstruction via more accurate and robust camera-constraints. Preliminary results are reported for mapping a 1,300 image data set covering a 30 m by 5 m section of the hull of a USS aircraft carrier. The post-processed result validates the algorithm's potential to provide in-situ navigation in the underwater environment for trajectory control, while generating a texture-mapped 3D model of the ship hull as a byproduct for inspection.",

        "abstract": "We built an acoustical telepresence robot named TeleHead, which has a user-like dummy head and whose movement is synchronized with the user's head movement in real time. An accurate-shape user-like dummy head improves sound localization accuracy, but making an accurate-shape user-like dummy head for all users is not realistic. There have been many efforts to simplify dummy heads without head movement in order to make a dummy head suitable for all users. Head movement also improves sound localization accuracy. Therefore, we are trying to simplify TeleHead's head shape by taking the effect of head movement into consideration. In this work, we made two types of simplified dummy heads, a ball-like dummy head and a ball-like dummy head with a user-like pinna, and used them in sound localization experiments. The experimental results show that the pinna is very important for sound localization in the median plane. Head movement can improve sound localization and subjects can localize sound with another person's pinna. However, it is hard for subjects to localize a sound without a pinna even with head movement. In addition, the acoustical characteristics of each dummy head are significantly different. The results indicate the possibility of using a ball-like dummy head with a generic pinna for acoustical telepresence robots.",

        "abstract": "Recently, various social issues, such as global warming problem, economical abrupt move, and diseases associated with adult lifestyle habits, are reported. Against them, the role of bicycle has been reviewed as one of effective solutions. In fact, many types of bicycles have been developed and have been widely used in our daily life. Though commercially available bicycles have various size of frame for user's physical size, and the positions both of a saddle and a handle can be modified, but there is a lack of interests in the importance of bicycle position as a shared awareness. Provision of proper riding posture for riders based on their physical properties would enable to improve the efficiency of cycling exercise, and to prevent some chronic pains occurred in places of body. To establish an optimization method of bicycle position based on individual biomedical information, this study focuses on the importance of bicycle position, especially we address to search a suitable saddle height corresponding to user's physical features and properties. This paper firstly develops an automatic saddle height control system, and secondly supposes an evaluation standard of cycling exercise based on electromyographic signals of rider's leg during cycling exercise, and an optimization method of saddle height by using fast Fourier transformation (FFT), principle component analysis (PCA), and fuzzy inference. This paper shows firstly the concepts of the evaluation standard we have defined for rider's pedaling performance with some experimental results, and introduces a fuzzy control system for automatic saddle height control.",

We apply this framework to common examples from marine robotics: standalone long baseline (LBL) positioning and integrated LBL reference and Doppler velocity log (DVL) dead-reckoning. The approach is based on formulating positioning as an estimation problem. Using simple sensor models for the most common information sources, we show how the the Cramer Rao lower bound can be used to predict the system-level navigation performance. The resulting three dimensional covariance matrix is then summarized using scalar performance metrics based on the notion of dilution of precision (DOP), a well-known concept from the global positioning system (GPS) community. To illustrate this general tool, we present the answers to a few particular questions: \u00b7 How does the baseline length affect the solution for standalone LBL positioning? \u00b7 When using DVL and heading odometry, how precise is the combined DVL/LBL solution? \u00b7 For an integrated DVL/LBL solution, what is the required update rate from the absolute reference to constrain odometry drift? \u00b7 What is the relative importance of heading, odometry and range precision for overall performance? We substantiate our estimation framework through experimental evidence which shows that the analytical predictions are consistent with performance in the field.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a predictive gain scheduler for path tracking control in a networked control system with variable delay. The controller uses the plant model to predict future position and find the amount of travel possible with the global path as a constraint. Based on variable network conditions and vehicle trajectory's curvature the vehicle is allowed to travel farther on the current control signal while the vehicle trajectory matches the path constraint. This method uses path specific characteristics to evaluate the effectiveness of each generated control signal. By scheduling the gain on the control signal the vehicle tracking performance is maintained with an increase in network delay. The tracking time is decreased compared to other methods since the proposed control method allows the controller to look ahead and thus evaluate predicted effect of each control signal before scaling it. The proposed method is compared with existing delay compensation methods through simulation.",

        "abstract": "Reliable recognition of activities from cluttered sensory data is challenging and important for a smart home to enable various activity-aware applications. In addition, understanding a user's preferences and then providing corresponding services is substantial in a smart home environment. Traditionally, activity recognition and preference learning were dealt with separately. In this work, we aim to develop a hybrid system which is the first trial to model the relationship between an activity model and a preference model so that the resultant hybrid model enables a preference model to assist in recovering performance of activity recognition in a dynamic environment. More specifically, on-going activity which a user performs in this work is regarded as high level contexts to assist in building a user's preference model. Based on the learned preference model, the smart home system provides more appropriate services to a user so that the hybrid system can better interact with the user and, more importantly, gain his/her feedback. The feedback is used to detect if there is any change in human behavior or sensor deployment such that the system can adjust the preference model and the activity model in response to the change. Finally, the experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports the development and experimental evaluation of a novel navigation system for underwater vehicles that employs Doppler sonar, synchronous clocks, and acoustic modems to achieve simultaneous acoustic communication and navigation. The system reported herein, which is employed to renavigate the vehicle in post-processing, forms the basis for a vehicle-based real-time navigation system. Existing high-precision absolute navigation techniques for underwater vehicles are impractical over long length scales and lack scalability for simultaneously navigating multiple vehicles. The navigation method reported in this paper relies on a single moving reference beacon, eliminating the requirement for the underwater vehicle to remain in a bounded navigable area. The use of underwater modems and synchronous clocks enables range measurements based on one-way time-of-flight information from acoustic data packet broadcasts. The acoustic data packets are broadcast from the single, moving reference beacon and can be received simultaneously by multiple vehicles within acoustic range. We report experimental results from the first deep-water evaluation of this method using data collected from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) survey carried out in 4000 m of water on the southern Mid-Atlantic Ridge. We report a comparative experimental evaluation of the navigation fixes provided by the proposed synchronous acoustic navigation system in comparison to navigation fixes obtained by an independent conventional long baseline acoustic navigation system.",

Moreover the joint velocities are guaranteed to be bounded by a desired threshold. As for other a null-space projection techniques known in the literature, joint speed commands are computed in such a way that lower priority tasks do not interfere with higher priority ones in the assumption that joint speeds can be arbitrarily large: in addition, if joint speeds are to be bounded by a desired value, joint velocity commands are limited by dynamically chosen values depending on the task priority. As a result, joint velocities are always bounded such that, if necessary, higher priority tasks are executed first.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a decentralized coordination algorithm that allows a team of sensor-enabled robots to navigate a region containing non-convex obstacles and take measurements within the region that contain the highest probability of having \u00bfgood\u00bf information first. This approach is motivated by scenarios where prior knowledge of the search space is known or when time constraints are present that limit the amount of area that can be searched by a robot team. Practical applications include search and rescue, target detection, and hazardous contaminations. Our cooperative control algorithm combines Voronoi partitioning, a global optimization technique, and a modified navigation function to prioritize sensor detection. The issues we address such as non-convex obstacles as well as global search are not extensively addressed in the current literature. Simulation results of the control algorithm are given and validate the prioritized sensing behavior as well as the collision avoidance property.",

More importantly, based on the trajectory signature, a probabilistic model-based cluster signature is further developed for modeling a motion class. The cluster signature is a mixture model-based motion description that is useful for motion class perception, recognition and to benefit a generalized robot task representation. The signature modeling process is supported by integrating the EM and IPRA algorithms. The conducted experiments verified the cluster signature's effectiveness.",

Our framework combines different sensing modalities and defines descriptive features in various spaces for the purpose of learning good object models. By fusing the 3D information acquired from a composite sensor that includes a color stereo camera, a time-of-flight (TOF) camera, and a thermal camera, we augment 3D depth data with color and temperature information which helps disambiguate the object categorization process. We make use of statistical relational learning methods (Markov Logic Networks and Bayesian Logic Networks) to capture complex interactions between the different feature spaces. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we analyze and validate the proposed system for the problem of recognizing objects in table settings scenarios.",

The technique uses range scans gathered with a Mechanical Scanning Imaging Sonar (MSIS), the robot displacement estimated through dead-reckoning using a Doppler velocity log (DVL) and a motion reference unit (MRU). The proposed method is an extension of the pIC algorithm. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used to estimate the robot-path during the scan in order to reference all the range and bearing measurements as well as their uncertainty to a scan fixed frame before registering. The major contribution consists of experimentally proving that probabilistic sonar scan matching techniques have the potential to improve the DVL-based navigation. The algorithm has been tested on an AUV guided along a 600 m path within an abandoned marina underwater environment with satisfactory results.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "These days researchers are looking for design and development of autonomous robots. It is desirable that robots be capable to acquire the information they need to perform actions and make decisions. Any mobile or humanoid robot will need to construct a spatial representation or model of the surrounding environment that allows it to move and execute tasks with success. The reconstruction of an environment is an important and useful capability for these kind of robots. In order to construct a model, the robot needs to obtain information through a series of acquisitions from its sensors by solving occlusions. Therefore, an important issue is how to plan these robot placements (views) optimally, according to certain criteria for the purpose of reconstructing a complete model automatically. In this work we present a view planning algorithm to solve the problem of 3D modelling for indoor environments; the algorithm uses a volumetric representation as a reasoning domain. In this paper we propose the use of probability distribution functions as a model for the desirable behavior of the system, considering perception range data. The method uses a maximum a posteriori estimator to find the perception system parameters that defines the next best view position. We present results in simulation for a five degrees of freedom robot with a 3D range camera mounted on it to validate our approach.",

The controller reported here works whether the system is overactuated or not; plus one does not need to derive the minimal-order dynamics model of the system. Since the dimension of projection matrix is fixed, the projection-based controller does not need to change its structure whenever the mechanical system changes its topology or number of degrees of freedom. Moreover, the derivation of the projection-based controller seems to be simpler than the inverse dynamics controller derived using Lagrange-D'Almbert formulation. This is because the structure of the former controller can be obtained from the Jacobian matrix of the constraints, which, in turn, can be deduced from the linkage geometry. The stability of the projection-based controllers are rigourously proved, while the condition for the controllability of parallel manipulators is also derived in detail. Finally, experimental results are appended.",

        "abstract": "Recently, many humanoid robots have been developed and actively investigated all over the world in order to realize partner robots which can coexist in an environment shared with humans. having good communication skills is essential in order to interact naturally with humans. However, even with state-of-the-art interaction technology, it is still difficult for humans to interact with humanoid robots without conscious effort. In this paper, we use the android robot, which has an appearance which is quite similar to that of a human, as a bystander in human-human communication. The android is not explicitly involved in the conversation, however it makes small reactions to the behavior of the humans, and the psychological effects of its behavior on the human subjects are investigated. Through the experiments, it is shown that if the android mimics the behavior of the subject this can be quite effective in harmonizing the human-human communication.",

        "abstract": "With the growing emergence of ubiquitous computing and networked systems, ubiquitous robotics is becoming an active research domain. The issue of services composition to offer seamless access to a variety of complex services has received widespread attention in recent years. The majority of the proposed approaches have been inspired from the research undertaken jointly on Workflow and AI-based classical planning techniques. However, the traditional AI-based methods assume that the environment is static and the invocation of the services is deterministic. In ubiquitous robotics, services composition is a challenging issue when the execution environment and services are dynamic and the knowledge about their state and context is uncertain. The services composition requires taking into account the parameters of quality of service (QoS) to adapt the composed service to context of the user and the environment, in particular, dealing with failures such as: service invocation failures, network disconnection, sensor failures, context change due to mobility of objects (robots, sensors, etc.), service discovery failures and service execution failures. In this paper, we present a framework which gives ubiquitous robotic system the ability to dynamically compose and deliver ubiquitous services, and to monitor their execution. The main motivation behind the use of services composition is to decrease time and costs to develop integrated complex applications using robots by transforming them from a single task issuer to smart services provider and human companion, without rebuilding each time the robotic system. To address these new challenges, we propose in this paper a new framework for services composition and monitoring, including QoS estimation and Bayesian learning model to deal with the dynamic and uncertain nature of the environment. This framework includes three levels: abstract plan construction, plan execution, and services discovery and re-composition. This approach is ... Show More",

        "abstract": "In this work we present a set of integrated methods that enable an RFID-enabled mobile manipulator to approach and grasp an object to which a self-adhesive passive (battery-free) UHF RFID tag has been affixed. Our primary contribution is a new mode of perception that produces images of the spatial distribution of received signal strength indication (RSSI) for each of the tagged objects in an environment. The intensity of each pixel in the 'RSSI image' is the measured RF signal strength for a particular tag in the corresponding direction. We construct these RSSI images by panning and tilting an RFID reader antenna while measuring the RSSI value at each bearing. Additionally, we present a framework for estimating a tagged object's 3D location using fused ID-specific features derived from an RSSI image, a camera image, and a laser range finder scan. We evaluate these methods using a robot with actuated, long-range RFID antennas and finger-mounted short-range antennas. The robot first scans its environment to discover which tagged objects are within range, creates a user interface, orients toward the user-selected object using RF signal strength, estimates the 3D location of the object using an RSSI image with sensor fusion, approaches and grasps the object, and uses its finger-mounted antennas to confirm that the desired object has been grasped. In our tests, the sensor fusion system with an RSSI image correctly located the requested object in 17 out of 18 trials (94.4%), an 11.1% improvement over the system's performance when not using an RSSI image. The robot correctly oriented to the requested object in 8 out of 9 trials (88.9%), and in 3 out of 3 trials the entire system successfully grasped the object selected by the user.",

In this paper, a novel object detection algorithm based on color histogram and adaptive bandwidth mean shift is proposed. The algorithm is capable of detecting objects rapidly and precisely. It is composed of two stages: a rough detection stage and a precise detection stage. At the rough detection stage, histogram back projection and thresholding are applied to fast object identification and rough global localization. At the precise detection stage, the precise position, size and orientation are derived under the adaptive bandwidth mean shift framework. Experiments verify that the algorithm is able to detect the size, position and orientation of general objects rapidly and precisely.",

However, utilizing the good velocity control performance of servo motor to achieve a high positional accuracy will arise excessive big internal forces. Therefore, an idea of introducing kinematical redundancy into force redundant parallel mechanism is proposed. In this idea, we do not add kinematical redundancy on the sub arm but introduce internal redundant motion into the top plate. The concept of this research is illustrated by improving a simple force redundant parallel example, and the merits of the improved mechanism are summarized. This theory is applied into modifying the real high speed parallel mechanism NINJA. Its kinematics and static force relationship are derived and compared respectively.

        "abstract": "The main driving force behind research on legged robots has always been their potential for high performance locomotion on rough terrain and the outdoors. Nevertheless, most existing control algorithms for such robots either make rigid assumptions about their environments (e.g flat ground), or rely on kinematic planning at low speeds. Moreover, the traditional separation of planning from control often has negative impact on the robustness of the system against model uncertainty and environment noise. In this paper, we introduce a new method for dynamic, fully reactive footstep planning for a simplified planar spring-mass hopper, a frequently used model for running behaviors. Our approach is based on a careful characterization of the model dynamics and an associated deadbeat controller, used within a sequential composition framework. This yields a purely reactive controller with a very large, nearly global domain of attraction that requires no explicit replanning during execution. Finally, we use a simplified hopper in simulation to illustrate the performance of the planner under different rough terrain scenarios and show that it is extremely robust to both model uncertainty and measurement noise.",

Therefore, this powerful primary sense has rarely been used inside the robotics community. This paper presents an effective olfactory-based planning and search algorithms for using on mobile robots. Olfactory-based mobile robots use odors as a guide to navigate and track in the unknown environments. The planning algorithms are based on Bayesian inference theory and artificial potential field methods. Inputs to the algorithms include the measured flow and the detection or non-detection events that happened at the robot location. This methodology results in algorithms for predicting likelihood of source location versus position. The robot would then optimize a desired trajectory to navigate in the odor plume and locate the odor source location.",

We analyze the difficulties in the control through the network and propose a practical solution for tracking using a PTZ network camera. Moreover, we propose a robust real time tracking approach, which enhances the effectiveness by using complementary features under a two-stage particle filtering framework and a multi-scale mechanism. To improve time performance, the tracking algorithm is implemented as a multi-threaded process in OpenMP. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our system in various applications such as pedestrian tracking, face tracking, and vehicle tracking.",

Comparing with the simple conversion equation of using just joint angle measurements, it enables to get more reliable estimates by using both joint angle measurements and F/T sensor outputs at the ankle joint. First, a nonlinear type observer is constructed in the extended Kalman filter framework to estimate the flexible rotational motion of biped. It is based on the inverted pendulum model with flexible beam which is to simply address the flexible behavior of a biped, specifically in the single support phase. Then, the predicted estimates of CoM by the flexible motion observer are combined with the outputs of the CoM conversion equation and the final estimates will be determined according to the weighting value which penalizes the flexible motion model and the CoM conversion equation. Simulation results are followed to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a LIDAR-based perception system for ground robot mobility, consisting of 3D object detection, classification and tracking. The presented system was demonstrated on-board our autonomous ground vehicle MuCAR-3, enabling it to safely navigate in urban traffic-like scenarios as well as in off-road convoy scenarios. The efficiency of our approach stems from the unique combination of 2D and 3D data processing techniques. Whereas fast segmentation of point clouds into objects is done in a 2\u00bfD occupancy grid, classifying the objects is done on raw 3D point clouds. For fast object feature extraction, we advocate the use of statistics of local point cloud properties, captured by histograms over point features. In contrast to most existing work on 3D point cloud classification, where real-time operation is often impossible, this combination allows our system to perform in real-time at 0.1s frame-rate.",

The proposed method is based on maintaining the overall dynamic balance by using the ZMP stability criterion throughout support phases. To be able to reach this goal, we utilize ZMP equations in spherical coordinates, so that the rate change of angular momentum terms in ZMP equations are included naturally by using Eulerian equations of motion for unsymmetrical bodies. Thus, undesired torso angle fluctuation is expected to be more restrainable comparing to other methods in which angular momentum information is ignored or zero-referenced. Applying the aforementioned technique, we primarily simulated running motion on a dynamic 3-D simulator. Secondarily, one-legged jumping experiments were conducted on the actual bipedal robot. In conclusion, we obtained repetitive and successful running and jumping cycles which satisfactorily verify the proposed method.",

In this paper, we present a scalable approach for efficiently retrieving closed contour shapes. The contour of an object is represented by piecewise linear segments. A skip Tri-Gram is obtained by selecting three segments in the clockwise order while allowing a constant number of segments to be \u00bfskipped\u00bf in between. The main idea is to use skip Tri-Grams of the segments to implicitly encode the distant dependency of the shape. All skip Tri-Grams are used for efficiently retrieving closed contour shapes without pairwise matching feature points from two shapes. The retrieval is at least an order of magnitude faster than other state-of-the-art algorithms. We score 80% in the Bullseye retrieval test on the whole MPEG 7 shape dataset. We further test the algorithm using a mobile robot platform in an indoor environment. 8 objects are used for testing from different viewing directions, and we achieve 82% accuracy.",

In developing a preliminary gesture library with thirteen symbolic gestures and eight touch subtypes, we have taken the first steps toward a robotic touch API, showing that the huggable robot behavior system will be able to stream currently active sensors to detect regional social gestures and local sub-gestures in realtime. The system demonstrates the infrastructure to detect three types of touching: social touch, local touch, and sensor-level touch.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes real-time sound source orientation estimation based on orientation-extended amplitude beamforming (OE-ABF). To recognize a sound source orientation (such as face orientation) is an important function for a robot who can achieve natural human-robot interaction because the function is required to distinguish the human target from a robot or another person. We developed a sound source orientation system using orientation-extended beamforming (OE-BF) and showed the system worked properly at least under a specific controlled environment. However, in practical use, this system does not work properly because the system doesn't take into account the differences between the supposed model in OE-BF and in practical situations. For example, the system model supposes that there is neither noise nor reverberation, however, this is not a realistic assumption. To solve this assumption mismatch problem, we propose sound source orientation estimation based on OE-ABF, and constructed a real-time sound source orientation estimation system with the proposed method using a 96ch microphone array. Evaluation results of our proposed system show that the average error of estimated angles is lower than 5\u00b0, while the error of our previously reported system was greater than 20\u00b0. With this system, the robot is able to distinguish that the utterance target of a person standing 1m in front is itself or another person standing 0.2m to the left of the robot. This is valuable for human-robot interaction.",

We propose constant time procedures to measure the distance between a given pair of poses, the mutual information gain for a given candidate link, and the joint marginals required for both measures. Using these measures, we can readily identify non redundant poses and highly informative links and use only those to augment and to update the state, respectively. The result is a delayed-state SLAM system that reduces both the use of memory and the execution time and that delays filter inconsistency by reducing the number of linearization introduced when adding new loop closure links. We evaluate the advantage of the proposed approach using simulations and data sets collected with real robots.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an approach for learning generalized models for traffic situations. We formulate the problem using a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) from which we learn the characteristic dynamics of a situation from labeled trajectories using kernel regression. For a new and unlabeled trajectory, we can then infer the corresponding situation by evaluating the data likelihood for the individual situation models. In experiments carried out on laser range data gathered on a car in real traffic and in simulation, we show that we can robustly recognize different traffic situations even from trajectories corresponding to partial situation instances.",

        "abstract": "The required tasks in fixed-base exoskeletons demand a fast position/force controller; yet robust against unknown disturbances due to the application itself is tightly coupled with a human in a wide range of operational conditions, which give rise to human-exoskeleton interaction dynamics, high nonlinear uncertain exoskeleton dynamics, noisy sensors and other parametric uncertainties, such as environmental contacts. These factors do not allow to account on a precise dynamical model, thus model-based (regressor-based) controllers are difficult to implement. This paper deals with a regressor-free smooth PID-like fast force/position controller which guarantees finite-time convergence within second order sliding modes, thus ensuring inherent robustness. Experimental platform allows assessing its performance for rehabilitation tasks, which validates its functionality in practical implementation.",

This paper describes the control scheme implemented in LineScout technology, one of the first teleoperated obstacle crossing systems that has progressed to the stage of actually performing very-high-voltage power line jobs. Following a brief overview of the hardware and software architecture, key challenges associated with the objectives of achieving reliability, robustness and ease of operation are presented. The coordinated control through visual feedback of all motors needed for obstacle crossing calls for a coherent strategy, an effective graphical user interface and rules to ensure safe, predictable operation. Other features such as automatic weight balancing are introduced to lighten the workload and let the operator concentrate on inspecting power line components. Open architecture was considered for progressive improvements. The features required to succeed in making power line robots fully autonomous are also discussed.",

In contrast to previous implementations, we rely only on low-cost, readily available system components and use strategic algorithms to resolve system uncertainty. We present a three-stage planner for block extraction which considers block selection, extraction order, and physics-based simulation that evaluates removability. Existing vision techniques are combined in a novel sequence for the identification and tracking of blocks within the tower. Discussion of our approach is presented following experimental results on a 5-DOF robot manipulator.",

        "abstract": "A new noise reduction method suitable for autonomous mobile robots was proposed and applied to preprocessing of a hands-free spoken dialogue system. When a robot talks with a conversational partner in real environments, not only speech utterances by the partner but also various types of noise, such as directional noise, diffuse noise, and noise from the robot, are observed at microphones. We attempted to remove these types of noise simultaneously with small and light-weighted devices and low-computational-cost algorithms. We assumed that the conversational partner of the robot was in front of the robot. In this case, the aim of the proposed method is extracting speech signals coming from the frontal direction of the robot. The proposed noise reduction system was evaluated in the presence of various types of noise: the number of word errors was reduced by 69% as compared to the conventional methods. The proposed robot auditory system can also cope with the case in which a conversational partner (i.e., a sound source) moves from the front of the robot: the sound source was localized by face detection and tracking using facial images obtained from a camera mounted on an eye of the robot. As a result, various types of noise could be reduced in real time, irrespective of the sound source positions, by combining speech information with image information.",

        "abstract": "Biologically-inspired swarm of robots with collaboration towards a common mission has a broad range of applications. However, the required dynamic localization among autonomous robots for such swarm collaboration, though usually implicitly assumed, has not been properly studied. In this paper, we address the roles of multiple antennas in localization and energy-efficient wireless communications for a swarm of robots. Following the gradient of signal powers along a trajectory, a robot can track the direction of a source robot. With three or more properly placed antennas that sense different phase shifts of carrier, a robot can localize a source. By lateration, three collaborative robots can localize a source with known distances to it. Via angulation technique, three robots can determine their geometric relationship with knowing two angles and one distance between them. The techniques can be extended from the 2-D to the 3-D space for application of wall-climbing robots. On the basis of knowledge of robot locations, beamforming techniques can be employed to receive and transmit signal towards the desired robot therefore improving energy efficiency and prolonging robot lifetime.",

        "abstract": "The development of a robot motion control scheme and a mechanical load adjuster with a motion measurement interface is addressed in this paper. To improve the efficiency of a task involving human-robot cooperation, we designed a novel robot control system, in which a multiple-load state can be provided for a human operator. This system also can provide a multiple-dynamics state during a task involving human-robot dynamical cooperation. The multiple-load state including its transition is effective and efficient in such a task. A single load state can be easily provided by the impedance control of the robot motion thus far; however, the multiple-load state and its transition are difficult to realize using a conventional control scheme. The proposed control scheme differs widely from a conventional impedance control scheme in that the multiple- load state as well as both active and passive states cannot be induced in the single robotic system. Under the proposed control scheme, the load state can be adjusted with the various dynamics in the active or passive state. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control system, human-robot cooperative experiments were carried out. Results showed that the proposed control scheme can provide the multiple-load state for use in a human-robot cooperative task system.",

        "abstract": "In the paper-container industry, bag stacking and un-stacking are very labor-intensive work. It is hard for companies to find enough people to fill these positions. Also the repetitive stack and un-stack work can easily cause back and waist injury. Therefore robot de-palletizing system is highly desirable. Guiding a robot tool reliably and robustly to insert into the gap on bag stack to pick up a layer of bags without disturbing the stack is highly challenging due to the variation of the gap-center position and gap size under different pressure depending upon the number of layers above it, the so-called \u00bfvariable crunch\u00bf factor. In this paper, the method combining an uncalibrated vision and 3D laser-assisted image analysis based on camera-space manipulation (CSM) is developed. The developed prototype system demonstrates the reliable gap insertion in de-palletizing process. It is ready to be installed to a factory floor at the Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation.",

        "abstract": "Robotic microhandling is a promising way to assemble microcomponents in order to manufacture new generation of Hybrid Micro ElectroMechanical Systems (HMEMS). However, at the scale of several micrometers, adhesion phenomenon highly perturbs the micro-objects release and the positioning. This phenomenon is directly linked to both the object and the gripper surface chemical composition. We propose to control adhesion by using chemical self-assembly monolayer (SAM) on both surfaces. Different types of chemical functionalisation have been tested and this paper only focuses on the presentation of aminosilane grafted (3 (ethoxydimethylsilyl) propyl amine (APTES) and (3 aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APDMES)). We show that the liquid pH can be used to modify the adhesion and to switch from an attractive behaviour to a repulsive behaviour. The pH control can thus be used to increase adhesion during handling and cancel adhesion during release. Experiments have shown that the pH control is able to control the release of a micro-object. This paper shows the relevance of a new type of reliable submerged robotic microhandling principle, which is based an adjusting chemical properties of liquid.",

        "abstract": "The paper aims to develop an automated wheel loading system in the trim-and-final assembly in automotive manufacturing. Currently most of the trim-and-final assemblies are still done manually since the production lines are typically moving randomly. Industrial robots are hardly used to perform any assembly tasks on the randomly changing environments because it is difficult for conventional industrial robots to adjust to any sort of change. Therefore, more intelligent industrial robotic system has to be developed to adopt the random motion of the moving production line for the wheel loading process. This paper presents an intelligent robotics system that performs the wheel loading process while the car is moving randomly with the production line using a synergic combination of visual servoing and force control technology. The developed intelligent robotic technology has been successfully implemented to assembly the wheel onto the car. This practical solution of performing wheel loading on the moving production line, which is not available on the current industrial robot market, can save a lot of money and increase the assembly quality for automotive manufacturing. Since the developed platform is based on the synergic combination of visual servoing and force control technology, it can be used in other areas, such as seam tracking, battery loading and seat loading etc.",

        "abstract": "Recently, several robotic/intelligent wheelchairs have been proposed that employ user-friendly interfaces or autonomous functions. Although it is often desirable for user to operate wheelchairs on their own, they are often accompanied by a caregiver or companion. In designing wheelchairs, it is important to reduce the caregiver load. In this paper we propose a robotic wheelchair that can move with a caregiver side by side. In contrast to a front-behind position, in a side-by-side position it is more difficult for wheelchairs to adjust when the caregiver makes a turn. To cope with this problem we present a visual-laser tracking technique. In this technique, a laser range sensor and an omni-directional camera are integrated to observe the caregiver. A Rao-Blackwellized particle filter framework is employed to track the caregiver's position and orientation of both body and head based on the distance data and panorama images captured from the laser range sensor and the omni-directional camera. After presenting this technique, we introduce an application of the wheelchair for museum visit use.",

It helps junior high / high school / university students to understand recent prosthetic technology and, moreover, to provide a chance to produce creative prosthetic applications for short time at low cost. The developmental kit consists of an EMG-to-Motor controller and a wire-driven device. For delivering the cheapness and easiness to students, we demonstrate three prosthetic applications based on the kit: (1) Simple Prosthetic Hand is a mimic of commercial prosthetic hand. It illustrates that low-precise design achieves cheap production cost and sufficient function as a prosthetic hand. (2) Rock-Scissors-Paper Prosthetic Hand is based on prosthetic hands for research use. It clearly illustrates EMG-to-Motion discrimination processes by displaying real signals. (3) EMG Presbyopia Spectacles shows the possibility that beginners design creative prosthetic applications based on daily activities. Finally, we report two educational courses we have conducted for junior high and high school students.",

We propose the use of inflatable robot links as structural members instead of traditional rigid links. We believe such links would allow the development of inherently safe robots. For these robots to be useful in tasks such as assisting humans, it is essential that we be able to control contact forces with these robots.

With the momentum conservation of the system, the kinematics and dynamics of the system are analyzed, and it is found that the generalized Jacobi matrix and the dynamic equations of the system are nonlinearly dependent on inertial parameters. In order to overcome the problems mentioned above, the idea of augmentation approach is introduced. It is shown that the augmented generalized Jacobi matrix and the dynamic equations of the system can be linearly dependent on a group of inertial parameters with augmented inputs and outputs. Based on the results, a robust adaptive composite control scheme for space-based robot to track the desired trajectories in inertial space is developed. The stability of the overall system is analyzed through Lyapunov direct method. For the proposed approach, the global uniform asymptotic stability of the system is established. In addition, the controller presented possesses the advantage that it needs no measurement of the position, linear velocity and acceleration of the base with respect to the orbit, because of the effective exploitation of the particular property of system dynamics. To show the feasibility of control scheme, a planar space robot system is simulated.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Modular, self-reconfigurable robots are robots that can change their own shape by physically rearranging the modules from which they are built. Self-reconfiguration can be controlled by e.g. an off-line planner, but numerous implementation issues hamper the actual self-reconfiguration process: the continuous evolution of the communication topology increases the risk of communications failure, generating code that correctly controls the self-reconfiguration process is non-trivial, and hand-tuning the self-reconfiguration process is tedious and error-prone. To address these issues, we have developed a distributed scripting language that controls self-reconfiguration of the ATRON robot using a robust communication scheme that relies on local broadcast of shared state. This language can be used as the target of a planner, offers direct support for parallelization of independent operations while maintaining correct sequentiality of dependent operations, and compiles to a robust and efficient implementation. Moreover, a novel feature of this language is its reversibility: once a self-reconfiguration sequence is described the reverse sequence is automatically available to the programmer, significantly reducing the amount of work needed to deploy self-reconfiguration in larger scenarios. We demonstrate our approach with long-running (reversible) self-reconfiguration experiments using the ATRON robot and a reversible self-reconfiguration experiment using simulated MTRAN modules.",

Constraints are usually unobservable and frequently change between contexts. In this paper, we present a novel approach for learning (unconstrained) control policies from movement data, where observations are recorded under different constraint settings. Our approach seamlessly integrates unconstrained and constrained observations by performing hybrid optimisation of two risk functionals. The first is a novel risk functional that makes a meaningful comparison between the estimated policy and constrained observations. The second is the standard risk, used to reduce the expected error under impoverished sets of constraints. We demonstrate our approach on systems of varying complexity, and illustrate its utility for transfer learning of a car washing task from human motion capture data.",

The proposed algorithm is based on extended Kalman filtering and fuses data from an optical tracking system and an inertial measurement unit. These two redundant sensor systems complement each other well, with the tracking system providing absolute positions and the inertial measurements giving low latency information of derivatives. Models for both sensors are given respecting the different sampling times and latencies. Another key issue is to use information about every landmark, i.e. marker ball, visible for the tracking system, by coupling the two sensor systems tightly together. The algorithm is evaluated in simulation and tested with an experimental hardware platform. The combined sensor system is robust with respect to short time marker occlusions and effectively compensates for latencies in the pose measurements.",

To achieve robust motion estimation even under time-varying lighting conditions, we incorporate illumination correction into the conventional 3D model-based tracking framework with a single camera. In addition, by computing the illumination bases online from the registered face images, after estimating the 3D head poses, user-specific illumination bases can be obtained, and therefore illumination-robust tracking without a prior learning process can be possible. Furthermore, our unified tracking is approximated as a linear least-squares problem; a closed-form solution is then provided. Therefore, it can be executed in real-time at 20 frames per second. After recovering full motion of the head, we can register face images with pose variations into stabilized (frontal) view images which are suitable for pose-robust face recognition. To verify the feasibility and applicability of our proposed 3D head-tracking framework, we performed extensive experiments with three sets of challenging image sequences.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses the extension of sample-based planning methods to the application of sensor planning for a partially unknown, moving target. This is achieved by modeling the target as a time-varying stochastic process with known mean and variance. Using the unscented transform, the target's statistics are then propagated through a user-supplied sensing effectiveness metric. The planner is demonstrated for a dynamic X-ray imaging platform tasked with viewing the human knee-joint center during normal, over-ground walking.",

        "abstract": "The core step of video stabilization is to estimate global motion from locally extracted motion clues. Outlier motion clues are generated from moving objects in image sequence, which cause incorrect global motion estimates. Random sample consensus (RANSAC) is popularly used to solve such outlier problem. RANSAC needs to tune parameters with respect to the given motion clues, so it sometimes fail when outlier clues are increased than before. Adaptive RANSAC is proposed to solve this problem, which is based on maximum likelihood sample consensus (MLESAC). It estimates the ratio of outliers through expectation maximization (EM), which entails the necessary number of iteration for each frame. The adaptation sustains high accuracy in varying ratio of outliers and faster than RANSAC when fewer iteration is enough. Performance of adaptive RANSAC is verified in experiments using four images sequences.",

In the proposed control method, an impedance controller is applied to the muscle-model-oriented control method by considering the end effector force vector.

The kinematic arrangement of the robot consists of 29 independently driven axes, including legs, arms, waist and a neck. This paper presents the highlights of the design of this robot and experimental walking results. Mechanical design, actuation mechanisms, sensors, the control hardware and algorithms are introduced. The actuation is based on DC motors, belt and pulley systems and Harmonic Drive reduction gears. The sensory equipment consists of joint encoders, force/torque sensors, inertial measurement systems and cameras. The control hardware is based on a dSpace digital signal processor. A smooth walking trajectory is generated. A variety of controllers for landing impact reduction, body inclination and Zero Moment Point (ZMP) regulation, early landing trajectory modification, and foot-ground orientation compliance and independent joint position controllers are employed. A posture zeroing procedure is followed after manual zeroing of the robot joints. The experimental results indicate that the control algorithms presented are successful in improving the stability of the walk.",

The presented method bounds the dangerous behavior of the robot during the first instants of the impact by limiting the energy stored into the system to a maximum imposed value.Two critical physical human robot interaction (pHRI) cases are studied, these are the collision either against a free or a clamped head. Safe energy values that can be used as reference were retrieved by analysing experimental data of energy absorption to failure of cranium bones and cervical spinal cords.The energy regulation control is implemented in a series elastic actuator prototype joint. The model and the control scheme of the system are analysed. The proposed control scheme is a position-based controller that adjusts the position trajectory reference in function of the maximum energy value imposed by the user. Preliminary results are presented to show that the actuator unit and this control scheme are capable of limiting the energy to a maximum imposed value.",

The work deals with the definition of an intrinsically safe algorithm to avoid collisions between an industrial manipulator and obstacles in its workspace (Standard ISO 10218-1). The suggested strategy aims to offer an industrial solution to the problem: an off-line analysis of the workspace is performed to have an exhaustive and intrinsically description of the static obstacles and a safe spatial grid of \u00bfpass-through points\u00bf is calculated; an on-line algorithm, based on an enhanced artificial potential field evaluates the most suitable points to avoid collisions against obstacles and perform a realtime replanning the path of the robot. A Matlab toolbox that elaborates STL CAD files has been developed to obtain a full description of the workcell, and the avoidance algorithm has been designed and implemented in a standard industrial controller. Various experimental results are reported by using a COMAU NS16 arm manipulator.",

        "abstract": "A major barrier preventing the wide employment of mobile networks of robots in tasks such as exploration, mapping, surveillance, and environmental monitoring is the lack of efficient and scalable multi-robot passive and active sensing (estimation) methodologies. The main reason for this is the absence of theoretical and practical tools that can provide computationally tractable methodologies which can deal efficiently with the highly nonlinear and uncertain nature of multi-robot dynamics when employed in the aforementioned tasks. In this paper, a new approach is proposed and analyzed for developing efficient and scalable methodologies for a general class of multi-robot passive and active sensing applications. The proposed approach employs an estimation scheme that switches among linear elements and, as a result, its computational requirements are about the same as those of a linear estimator. The parameters of the switching estimator are calculated off-line using a convex optimization algorithm which is based on optimization and approximation using Sum-of-Squares (SoS) polynomials. As shown by rigorous arguments, the estimation accuracy of the proposed scheme is equal to the optimal estimation accuracy plus a term that is inversely proportional to the number of estimator's switching elements (or, equivalently, to the memory storage capacity of the robots' equipment). The proposed approach can handle various types of constraints such as communication and computational constraints as well as obstacle avoidance and maximum speed constraints and can treat both problems of passive and active sensing in a unified manner. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on a 3D active target tracking application employing flying robots.",

While object detection has made significant progress in recent years, many current approaches involve extremely complex algorithms, and are prohibitively slow when applied to large scale robotic settings. In this paper, we describe an object detection system that is designed to scale gracefully to large data sets and leverages upward trends in computational power (as exemplified by Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) technology) and memory. We show that our GPU-based detector is up to 90 times faster than a well-optimized software version and can be easily trained on millions of examples. Using inexpensive off-the-shelf hardware, it can recognize multiple object types reliably in just a few seconds per frame.",

        "abstract": "In bilateral teleoperation, the operator experiences forces and torques applied to the slave manipulator. These forces and torques, however, consist of two components: on the one hand, forces and torques due to contacts with the environment, and on the other hand, non-contact forces, i.e., inertial forces, centrifugal forces, Coriolis forces, and associated torques. For several reasons, eliminating these non-contact forces and torques from the force-torque measurements of the slave or scaling them can be advantageous. For instance, in highly-dynamic teleoperation tasks, these forces and torques may contribute to operator fatigue or hamper the detection of contacts with the environment. This paper briefly reviews the estimation of inertial parameters of the slave load, e.g., an end-effector or a gripper. Subsequently, a method for eliminating the non-contact forces and torques from the measurements of a wrist-mounted force-torque sensor or scaling them is presented. After a brief overview of our teleoperation system, experimental results are presented which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

Because controlling multiple robots places additional demands on the operator we hypothesized that removing the forced pace for reviewing camera video might reduce workload and improve performance. In an earlier experiment participants operated four teams performing a simulated urban search and rescue (USAR) task using a conventional streaming video plus map interface or an experimental interface without streaming video but with the ability to store panoramic images on the map to be viewed at leisure. Operators were more accurate in marking victims on maps using the conventional interface; however, ancillary measures suggested that the asynchronous interface succeeded in reducing temporal demands for switching between robots. This raised the possibility that the asynchronous interface might perform better if teams were larger. In this experiment we evaluate the usefulness of asynchronous video for teams of 4, 8, or 12 robots. Operators in the two conditions were equally successful in finding victims, however, the streaming video maintained its advantage for accuracy in locating victims.",

In this paper, we describe a novel lightweight scene recognition method using an adaptive descriptor which is based on color features and geometric information for omnidirectional vision. Our method enables the robot to add nodes to a topological map automatically and solve the localization problem of mobile robot in realtime. The descriptor of a scene is extracted in the YUV color space and its dimension is adaptive depending on the segmentation result of the panoramic image. Furthermore, the descriptor is invariant to rotation and slight changes of illumination. The robustness of the scene matching and recognition is tested through real experiments in a dynamic indoor environment. The experiment is carried out on a mobile robot equipped with an omnidirectional camera. In our tests, the average processing time is 30 ms for each frame including feature extraction, matching, and the adding of new nodes.",

        "abstract": "We study a simple algorithm inspired by the Brazil nut effect for achieving segregation in a swarm of mobile robots. The algorithm lets each robot mimic a particle of a certain size and broadcast this information locally. The motion of each particle is controlled by three reactive behaviors: random walk, taxis, and repulsion by other particles. The segregation task requires the swarm to self-organize into a spatial arrangement in which the robots are ranked by particle size (e.g., annular structures or stripes). Using a physics-based computer simulation, we study the segregation performance of swarms of 50 mobile robots. The robots represent particles of three different sizes. We first analyze the problem of how to combine the basic behaviors so as to minimize the percentage of errors in rank. We then show that the system is very robust to noise on inter-robot perception and communication. For a noise level of 50%, the mean percentage of errors in rank is 1%. Moreover, we investigate a simplified version of the control algorithm, which does not rely on communication. Finally, we show that the mean percentage of errors in rank decreases exponentially as the particles' size ratio increases. As the error is bounded, one can achieve 100% error-free segregation. The reduction in error, however, comes at the expense of an increase in the required sensing/communication range.",

        "abstract": "In the robotics and computer vision communities, localization and mapping of an unknown environment is a well studied problem. To tackle this problem in real-time using a single camera, state-of-the-art Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) or Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms can be used. To create the model of the unknown environment, the camera moves and adds to the map from point to point, and assumes that these detected points are unique 3D corners. However, the scene usually contains false 3D corners, lying at e.g. occlusion boundaries. Inserting these points into the map may lead to SLAM failure or to less accurate estimations in SfM. In this work, a corner selection scheme is proposed that exploits the amplitude and depth signals of a Time-of- Flight (ToF) camera. The selection scheme detects false 3D corners based on a 3D cornerness measure. We then prove that the rejection of these corners increases the accuracy with a simulated SfM example and show the results of using our selection scheme with the ToF camera sequences.",

Most climbing robots can be seen as mobile manipulators whose base is also moving across the climbing structure, and consequently adds some additional positioning errors. 3DCLIMBER is a serial mechanism pole climbing robot, developed at ISR-UC. The preliminary tests of the robot showed that it is particularly important to position the grippers precisely in the appropriate pose before grasping the structure. Otherwise the accumulating error will impair autonomous climbing process by forcing the operator to stop the operation after a couple of steps in order to calibrate the robot. This paper describes a self calibrating method proposed to measure and compensate these errors.",

The system consists of two main parts; a single cell suction module, and a PDMS-based microfluidic chip controlled by an external pump. The desired number of vacuumed cells can be directed into the microfluidic chip and stored in a docking area. From the batch, they can be moved to next module by activating pneumatic pressure valves located on two sides of the chip.",

In human or animal, it is known that neural oscillators could produce rhythmic commands efficiently and robustly under the changing task environment. In particular, entrainments of the neural oscillator play a key role to adapt the nervous system to the natural frequency of the interacted environments. Hence, we discuss how a robot arm controls for exhibiting natural adaptive motions as a controller employing the entrainment property. To demonstrate the excellence of entrainment, we implement the proposed control scheme to a real robot arm. Then this work shows the performance of the robot arm coupled to neural oscillators in various tasks that the arm traces a trajectory. Exploiting the neural oscillator and its entrainment property, we experimentally verify an impressive capability of self-adaptation of the neural oscillator that enables the robot arm to make adaptive changes corresponding to an exterior environment.",

        "abstract": "In order to achieve the autonomy of mobile robots, effective localization is a necessary prerequisite. In this paper, we propose an improved Monte Carlo localization using self-adaptive samples, abbreviated as SAMCL. This algorithm employs a pre-caching technique to reduce the on-line computational burden. Further, we define the concept of similar energy region (SER), which is a set of poses (grid cells) having similar energy with the robot in the robot space. By distributing global samples in SER instead of distributing randomly in the map, SAMCL obtains a better performance in localization. Position tracking, global localization and the kidnapped robot problem are the three sub-problems of the localization problem. Most localization approaches focus on solving one of these sub-problems. However, SAMCL solves all these three sub-problems together thanks to self-adaptive samples that can automatically separate themselves into a global sample set and a local sample set according to needs. The validity and the efficiency of our algorithm are demonstrated by experiments carried out with different intentions. Extensive experiment results and comparisons are also given in this paper.",

The major improvement from the previous work is to mount the 9-DOF mechanism, which mimicking a glove puppet manipulation, on a two-wheel mobile platform. The platform provides agile movements of the robot but itself is an unstable system. Hence, a self-balancing controller is implemented by considering the motion as well as configuration variation of the upper body (the 9-DOF mechanism). The control law utilizes the principle of computed torque method with online identification of related parameters using various sensors including an accelerometer. The incline angle is obtained by fusing a gyroscope and a tilt sensor. Under the balancing control, the forward motion of the robot is achieved by giving a desired tilt angle profile. To minimize the footprint of electronics, the controller is implemented using an 8-bit single-chip microcontroller. Further, to enhance the interaction capability of the system, a simple gesture coding using dynamic time warping[2] identification method with Markov model is implemented for the data glove to recognize the puppet gesture by human hand.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel approach to perform indoor self-localization using reference omnidirectional images. We only need one omnidirectional image of the whole scene stored in the robot memory and a conventional uncalibrated on-board camera. We match the omnidirectional image and the conventional images captured by the on-board camera and compute the hybrid epipolar geometry using lifted coordinates and robust techniques. We map the epipole in the reference omnidirectional image to a ground plane through a homography in lifted coordinates also, giving the position of the robot in the planar ground, and its uncertainty. We perform experiments with simulated and real data to show the feasibility of this new self-localization approach.",

To realize smooth locomotion on rough terrain, some tracked vehicles are equipped with \u201cactive flippers.\u201d Such flippers increase the traversability and stability of tracked vehicles. However, their control increases the operator workload, especially in the case of teleoperation. To eliminate this problem, we have developed an autonomous controller for generating terrain-reflective motions of flippers. Terrain information is obtained using laser range sensors that are located at both sides of our tracked vehicle testbed. Using this system, operators only have to specify a direction to the robot, following which the robot traverses rough terrain using autonomous flipper motions. In this paper, we introduce a strategy and an algorithm for the controller for active flippers and validate the reliability of the system through experimental results on rough terrain.",

In this paper, a new approach to shape changing of deformable objects by a system of manipulators is presented. First, an integrated dynamic equation of motion for a system of multiple manipulators handling a deformable object is developed. The initial and the final shapes of the deformable object are specified by curves that represent the boundary of the object. We design an optimization-based planner that minimizes an energy-like criterion to determine the locations of the contact points on the desired curve representing the final shape of the object. The motion of each manipulator is controlled independently without any communication between them. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.",

We have previously shown that terrain spatiograms can be shared between robots in a heterogeneous team to recognize landmarks and to fuse observations from multiple sensors or multiple platforms. A terrain spatiogram using a mixture of Gaussians (MOG) model is introduced and a corresponding normalized spatiogram similarity measure defined. Two methods to generate a MOG terrain spatiogram are presented and compared experimentally using indoor and outdoor landmark information transferred between two different models of robot equipped with differently configured stereocameras.",

To be practically usable, the vehicle requires a function that enables the rider to get on and off both safely and smoothly while on a slope of unknown angle. Concretely, for the convenience of the rider, the vehicle needs to be stabilized on an unknown slope without the rider aboard, both before the rider gets on it and after he/she gets off it. Moreover, the vehicle should be stabilized safely relative to the rider's handling force at a grip of the vehicle while getting on and off. We thus developed a method of estimating the handling force and the slope angle separately. In this paper, we report the method to estimate the handling force and the slope angle using a disturbance observer. We verified the validity of our proposed estimation method by computer simulations and experiments using a prototype of a human-riding wheeled inverted pendulum on an unknown slope.",

It significantly reduces the size of the data set. It also contains higher geometric information, which is necessary for robust post processing. The paper describes an algorithm to convert global 2D robot maps to line segment representation, using a pre-aligned set of point-based single scans as input. Mean-shift clustering on the set of all line segments is utilized to merge perceptually similar segments to single instances: locally linear features in the environment are unambiguously represented by single line segments in the final global map. Apart from a scaling parameter, the approach is parameter free. Experiments on real world data sets prove its applicability in the field of robot mapping.",

        "abstract": "Robust localization of robots and reliable tracking of people are both critical requirements for the deployment of service robots in real-world environments. In crowded public spaces, occlusions can impede localization using on-board sensors. At the same time, teams of service robots working together need to share the locations of people and other robots on the same global coordinate system in order to provide services efficiently. To solve this problem, our approach is to use an infrastructure of sensors embedded in the environment to provide an inertial reference frame and wide-area coverage. Based on a people-tracking system we have previously established which uses laser range finders to track people's trajectories, we have developed a technique to localize a team of service robots on a shared global coordinate system. Each robot's odometry data is associated with the observed trajectory of an entity detected by the laser tracking system, and Kalman filters are used to correct rotational offsets between the robots' individual coordinate systems and the global reference frame. We present our data association and pose correction algorithms and show results demonstrating the performance of our system in a shopping arcade.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a control framework for humanoid robots that uses all joints simultaneously to track motion capture data and maintain balance. The controller comprises two main components: a balance controller and a tracking controller. The balance controller uses a regulator designed for a simplified humanoid model to obtain the desired input to keep balance based on the current state of the robot. The simplified model is chosen so that a regulator can be designed systematically using, for example, optimal control. An example of such controller is a linear quadratic regulator designed for an inverted pendulum model. The desired inputs are typically the center of pressure and/or torques of some representative joints. The tracking controller then computes the joint torques that minimize the difference from desired inputs as well as the error from desired joint accelerations to track the motion capture data, considering exact full-body dynamics. We demonstrate that the proposed controller effectively reproduces different styles of storytelling motion using dynamics simulation considering limitations in hardware.",

Gel microbeads are made by salting-out hydrophilic photo-crosslinkable resin ENT-3400. These gel microbeads were separated according to their size using microfilters made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The first filter is a row of fluidic microchannels that block microbeads with a size greater than the channel's width. Another filtration method has been examined using a magnetically driven microtool (MMT) to separate the beads using the centrifugal force created by this MMT actuated with a DC motor. Separated gel microbeads were recovered after filtration and used to fabricate functional microtools, for example, a tether-shaped gel tool, by contact with other gel microbeads under UV illumination. The produced gel tool is manipulated using optical tweezers in a microchip. We successfully achieved size-dependent separation of gel microbeads and production of a tether-shaped gel tool.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper the problem of path following control of autonomous vehicles subject to sliding is addressed. First a kinematic model is built which takes sliding effects into account by introducing two additional tire sliding angles. Since the tire sliding angles cannot be directly measured by sensors, an adaptive robust Luenberger observer is designed. With this observer, the tire cornering stiffness instead of the sliding angles is identified in presence of time-varying lateral disturbance. The Lyapunov stability theory guarantees that the estimated cornering stiffness would converge to a neighborhood of the real value when control inputs excitated the system persistently. But due to the existence of the lateral disturbance which causes loss of accuracy of the sliding angle reconstruction, the previously designed anti-sliding controller whose effectiveness completely depends on the estimation of the sliding angles cannot yield satisfactory results. To overcome this problem a tire-oriented kinematic model is built in which the inaccuracy of the sliding angle reconstruction is modeled in form of additive disturbances to the kinematic model. By transforming the tire-oriented kinematic model into a perturbed chained system, a sliding mode controller, which is robust to both the sliding effects and the negative effects of the lateral disturbance is designed with the help of the natural algebraic structure of the chained systems. Simulation results show that the proposed methods can provide accurate estimation of the sliding angles and guarantee high anti-sliding control accuracy even in presence of time-varying lateral disturbance.",

It is based on sliding mode observer that provides both the estimates of the gyro-bias and the actual attitude of the rigid body. The algorithm was developed in order to address the well-known problem of the weak dynamics of the tilt sensors and magnetometers, which can be modeled by low pass filters, and of the measurement bias of the gyros. In its design the observer uses the real measurements given by the low-cost attitude sensors (inclinometers and magnetometers) and the gyros, the filters modeling the sensors and the kinematics equation of the rigid body. The asymptotic convergence of the estimation of the attitude and bias-gyros was proven using Lyapunov stability method. The effectiveness of the algorithm has been shown from experimental tests using a rotary platform equipped with several sensors with axes of rotation coincide with orientation of the rigid body. Also, tests for comparison with a linear complementary filter are given.",

Definitions of the slip ratio for a wheel with lugs and methods of estimating it for all wheels onboard have seldom been attempted. This paper presents several definitions for the slip ratio of a lugged wheel, which can be interconverted by altering the shearing radius. Equations for calculating the longitudinal velocity and slip ratio of a wheel moving on rough terrain are deduced from the horizontal speed of the wheel's axle. Wheel-soil interaction experiments were performed for two types of wheels with different radii and lugs of different heights. The drawbar pull, torque, and wheel sinkage were measured using sensors. These data confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed slip ratio definition methods. Furthermore, two slip ratio estimation methods are proposed and verified: a visual information-based method by analyzing the lug traces marked on the terrain with high precision, and a terramechanics-based method in which the equations for the vertical load and torque are solved to estimate the slip ratios of all wheels.",

        "abstract": "Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) has been gradually applied in hospitals due to its great advantage that it can directly view the entire small bowel in human body compared with traditional endoscopies and other imaging techniques for gastrointestinal diseases. However, a challenging problem with this new technology is that too many images produced by WCE causes a tough task to doctors, so it is very significant to help and relief the clinicians if we can develop computer based automatic detection system to prescreen the collected large amount of images and identify the images with potential problems. In this paper, we propose a new scheme aimed for small bowel tumor detection of WCE images. This new scheme utilizes texture feature, also a powerful clue used by physicians, to detect tumor images with support vector machine. We put forward a new idea of wavelet based local binary pattern as the textural features to discriminate tumor regions from normal regions, which take advantage of wavelet transform and uniform local binary pattern. With support vector machine as the classifier, three-fold cross validation experiments on our present image data verify that it is promising to employ the proposed texture features to recognize the small bowel tumor regions.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for trajectory planning of multiple robot manipulators operating amongst obstacles. Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are exploited to compute the proximity between line-swept sphere (LSS) bounding volumes used to model potentially colliding objects. The KKT multipliers and the parameters giving the minimum distance between LSS volumes are augmented into the manipulator trajectory planning problem as dummy control variables. These extra variables allow the planning problem to be cast as a standard nonlinear optimal control problem with smooth path constraints, which is then solved using the pseudospectral method. The utility of the approach is demonstrated by a trajectory planning example involving stationary workspace obstacles and for a centralized multi-robot system in which each robot acts as a dynamic obstacle that the other should avoid. The optimal control formulation incorporates practical constraints on the manipulator joint angles, velocities and accelerations as well as limits on the control torque. The computed collision-free optimal trajectories are executed on a pair of experimental robots to verify the feasibility of the numerical results.",

        "abstract": "Multi robot motion planning problems can be solved very efficiently when the configuration space is mapped onto a graph. Before planning, however, it must be assured that the constructed graph is reachable (solvable) for the given number and configuration of robots. Solvable trees are types of trees that let any arrangement of a specified number of robots be reached from any initial arrangement through sequential moves of robots on vertices of the tree. In this paper the properties of solvable trees are investigated, and minimal solvable trees, which are the smallest solvable trees in terms of the number of vertices, are introduced as a new concept. Also, a new algorithm with linear time complexity is proposed for deciding whether a multi robot motion planning problem has a solution on a tree, without explicitly solving it.",

        "abstract": "The increasing complexity of modern robots makes it prohibitively hard to accurately model such systems as required by many applications. In such cases, machine learning methods offer a promising alternative for approximating such models using measured data. To date, high computational demands have largely restricted machine learning techniques to mostly offline applications. However, making the robots adaptive to changes in the dynamics and to cope with unexplored areas of the state space requires online learning. In this paper, we propose an approximation of the support vector regression (SVR) by sparsification based on the linear independency of training data. As a result, we obtain a method which is applicable in real-time online learning. It exhibits competitive learning accuracy when compared with standard regression techniques, such as v-SVR, Gaussian process regression (GPR) and locally weighted projection regression (LWPR).",

Planning is performed within a geometric graph that is established by sampling deterministically from a manifold that is obtained by combining configuration space and time. We show that these graphs are acyclic and shortest path algorithms with linear runtime can be employed. By reparametrising the configuration space to match the course of the road, it can be sampled very economically with few vertices, and this reduces absolute runtime further. The trajectories generated are quintic splines. They are second order continuous, obey nonholonomic constraints and are optimised for minimum square of jerk. Planning time remains below 20 ms on general purpose hardware.",

Then, the EAR sensor is assessed against various scenarios, in real noisy robotics environments.

        "abstract": "Service robots are anticipated to be used in unstructured areas such as homes, hospitals, and public areas in the near future. However, safety issues need to be addressed before this can occur. In particular, robot manipulators that handle objects by physical contact run the risk of colliding with people or objects. Thus, it is important to prevent collisions that could injure people and damage robot manipulators. In this study, a safe joint mechanism is developed to ensure the safe use of a manipulator. This mechanism, termed \u2018Spring-Clutch,\u2019 is a simple passive mechanism that consists of a coil spring and a CAM mechanism. When a torque is applied that is less than a threshold value, Spring-Clutch functions as a rigid joint between the input and the output. However, when an applied torque exceeds the threshold, angular displacement occurs between the input and output to reduce the collision force. If the applied torque is removed, Spring-Clutch immediately returns to its nominal position without the need for additional operations. This paper describes the design principles and performance of Spring-Clutch, and discusses the possibility of its practical use as a joint mechanism for safe manipulation.",

Motivated by the application of an ocean vehicle performing an autonomous ship hull inspection, our planar vehicle model performs localization using point features from a given map. Cases in which the agent must update the map are also considered. The stability of the controller and estimator duo is investigated using a pair of theorems requiring boundedness and convergence of the transition matrix Euclidean norm. These theorems yield a stability test for the feedback controller. Perturbations are then considered using a theorem on the convergence on the perturbed system transition matrix, yielding a robustness test for the estimator. Together, these tests form a set of tools which can be used in planning and evaluating the robustness of marine vehicle survey trajectories, which is demonstrated through experiment.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an architecture extending bottom-up visual attention for dynamic scene analysis. In dynamic scenes, particularly when learning actions from demonstrations, robots have to stably focus on the relevant movement by disregarding surrounding noises, but still maintain sensitivity to a new relevant movement, which might occur in the surroundings. In order to meet the contradictory requirements of stability and sensitivity for attention, this paper introduces biologically-inspired mechanisms for retinal filtering and stochastic attention selection. The former reduces the complexity of peripheral signals by filtering an input image. It results in enhancing bottom-up saliency in the fovea as well as in detecting only prominent signals from the periphery. The latter allows robots to shift attention to a less but still salient location in the periphery, which is likely relevant to the demonstrated action. Integrating these mechanisms with computation for bottom-up saliency enables robots to extract important action sequences from task demonstrations. Experiments with a simulated and a natural scene show better performance of the proposed model than comparative models.",

        "abstract": "Stability problems associated with haptics and robot control with obstacle avoidance are analyzed. Obstacle avoidance algorithms are revised to accomplish stable redesign using absolute stability and passivity theory. A modification of potential functions for haptic rendering and obstacle avoidance allowing stable operation for high stiffness is proposed. The modification leads to velocity-dependent potential-like repulsive stable haptic force interaction with obstacles. Using strictly positive real re-design, stable force interaction can be provided also for high stiffness of manipulated objects or obstacles.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "One of the most amazing phenomena widely observed in nature is self-assembly; living systems spontaneously form their body structure through the developmental process. While this remarkable phenomenon are not thoroughly understood in biology, the concept of self-assembly becomes undeniably indispensable also in artificial systems as they increase in size and complexity. Based on this consideration, this paper discusses the realization of self-assembly with the use of a multi-robotic system each of which has simple motile function. The main contributions of this paper are twofold: the first concerns a fully decentralized control method derived from the mutual entrainment between coupled nonlinear oscillators; and the second is related to the exploitation of physical interaction between agents stemming from a passive deformation mechanism, which allows an efficient movement of individual agents during the course of self-assembly. Here, form generation by self-assembly is considered as the result of time evolution toward the most dynamically stable state. Owing to this, in principle, the proposed method also satisfies significant ability of self-repair without making any modification to the proposed algorithm. In this paper we validate proposed method by exploiting real physical robotic agents. Experimental results show that stable and spontaneous self-assembly is achieved irrespective of the initial positional relationship between the agents.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a methodology to generate dynamically stable whole-body motions for a humanoid robot, which are converted from human motion capture data. The methodology consists of the kinematic and dynamical mappings for human-likeness and stability, respectively. The kinematic mapping includes the scaling of human foot and Zero Moment Point (ZMP) trajectories considering the geometric differences between a humanoid robot and a human. It also provides the conversion of human upper body motions using the method in [1]. The dynamic mapping modifies the humanoid pelvis motion to ensure the movement stability of humanoid whole-body motions, which are converted from the kinematic mapping. In addition, we propose a simplified human model to obtain a human ZMP trajectory, which is used as a reference ZMP trajectory for the humanoid robot to imitate during the kinematic mapping. A human whole-body dancing motion is converted by the methodology and performed by a humanoid robot with online balancing controllers.",

We employ a library of optimal trajectories and the neighboring optimal control method to generate local approximations to the optimal control. We take advantage of a parametric nonlinear optimization method, SNOPT, to generate initial trajectories and then use Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) to further refine them and get their neighboring optimal control. A library generation method is proposed, which keeps the trajectory library to a reasonable size. We compare the proposed controller with an optimal controller and an LQR based gain scheduling controller using the same optimization criterion.

The motivation behind this approach comes from research in the field of human neuroscience. In human locomotion it has been found that the head plays a very important role in guiding and planning motion. We use this idea to generate humanoid whole-body motion derived purely as a result of moving the head joint. The input to move the head joint is provided by a user via a 6D mouse. The algorithm presented in this study judges when further head movement leads to instability, and then generates stepping motions to stabilize the robot. By providing the software with autonomy to decide when and where to step, the user is allowed to simply steer the robot head (via visual feedback) without worrying about stability. We illustrate our results by presenting experiments conducted in simulation, as well as on our robot, HRP2.",

By \u00bfbarge-in\u00bf, we mean that the user can speak simultaneously when the robot is speaking.We focused on MCSB-ICA to achieve such an audition system because it can separate a user's and a robot's speech under reverberant environments. The problem with MCSB-ICA for robot audition is the slow speed of convergence in estimating a separation filter due to its step-size parameters. Many optimization methods cannot be adopted because their computational costs are proportional to the 2nd order of the reverberation time. Our method yields adaptive step-size parameters with MCSB-ICA at low computational costs. It is based on three techniques; (1) recursive expression of the separation process, (2) a piecewise linear model of the step-size of the separation filter, and (3) adaptive step-size parameters with a sub-ICA-filter. Experimental results show that our approach attains faster convergence speed and lower computational costs than those with a fixed step-size parameter.",

The algorithm uses visual odometry for localization. The terrain is modeled from stereo images and its traversability is estimated. A D* Lite planner is used for efficiently planning a short and safe path by incorporating terrain traversability in the planning process. The robot actively explores its environment as it follows the path to the goal. The algorithm has been tested on a wheel driven mobile robot and on a six-legged walking robot on rough terrain.",

For a wall climbing robot that operates in an urban environment, it is essential to automatically detect surface types and orientations for switching between moving and climbing, and for applying different adhesive forces both to save energy and ensure its own safety. This paper presents a novel segmentation-based stereovision approach in order to rapidly obtain accurate 3D estimations of urban scenes with largely textureless areas and sharp depth changes. The new approach takes advantage of the fact that many man-made objects in an urban setting consist of planar surfaces. Our approach has three main components: extraction of natural (planar) matching primitives, stereo matching via three-step algorithm (global match, local match and plane fitting), and plane merging and parameter refinement. Experimental results are provided for real indoor scenes.",

        "abstract": "Road detection is a crucial problem for intelligent vehicles and mobile robots. Most of the methods proposed nowadays only achieve reliable results in relatively well-arranged environments. In this paper, we proposed a stereovision-based road boundary detection method by combining homography estimation and MRF-based belief propagation to cope with challenging scenarios such as unstructured roads with unhomogeneous surfaces. In the method, each pixel in the reference image is firstly labeled as \u00bfroad\u00bf or \u00bfnon-road\u00bf by minimizing a well defined energy function that accounts for the planar road region. Subsequently, both of the road boundaries are generated using Catmull-Rom splines based on RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm with varying road structure models to help the intelligent vehicle understand the structure as well as safe range of current road. In the suggested framework, both intensity and geometry information of road scenarios are used to contain all the regions belonging to the planar road plane, and the left and right road boundaries are generated separately using a robust fitting algorithm to handle different road structures. Therefore, more accurate as well as robust detection of the road can be expected. Experimental results on a wide variety of typical but challenging scenarios have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

It fundamentally mimics the skeleto-muscular system of human articulation, in which at least two muscles handle one rotary axis under their antagonistic (counteractive) action. In the first part of the paper one introduces basic formula for controlling the multi-DOF rotary joint that is assumed to be driven by a couple of novel actuators called ANLES (actuator with non-linear elastic system). It mimics a skeletal muscle in the sense of having a non-linear elasticity. Next the paper describes the structure of the ANLES that is designed and constructed for controlling the wrist joint of an anthropomorphic robot. The experimental results using three DOF joint controlled by four ANLES reveal that the joint angle and the joint stiffness can be independently controlled by the proposed formula.",

        "abstract": "The ability of mobile robots to generate feasible trajectories online is an important requirement for their autonomous operation in unstructured environments. Many path generation techniques focus on generation of time- or distance-optimal paths while obeying dynamic constraints, and often assume precise knowledge of robot and/or environmental (i.e. terrain) properties. In uneven terrain, it is essential that the robot mobility over the terrain be explicitly considered in the planning process. Further, since significant uncertainty is often associated with robot and/or terrain parameter knowledge, this should also be accounted for in a path generation algorithm. Here, extensions to the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm are presented that explicitly consider robot mobility and robot parameter uncertainty based on the stochastic response surface method (SRSM). Simulation results suggest that the proposed approach can be used for generating safe paths on uncertain, uneven terrain.",

We first demonstrate a movement of a link driven by actuator bundles in terms of high driving force. The variation of actuator parameters influences the movement of this mechanism. We confirm the link may shift and twist because of the variation of actuator parameters. We then introduce stochastic analysis to investigate the link angle considering the variation of actuator parameters. In the result, the variation of the link angle converges to zero when the number of actuator is large enough. In addition, we reinforce the result through dynamic simulation considering the variation of the parameters of actuators.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers robotic automation of a common surgical retraction primitive of exposing an underlying area by grasping and lifting a thin, 3D, possibly inhomogeneous layer of tissue. We present an algorithm that computes a set of stable and secure grasp-and-retract trajectories for a point-jaw gripper moving along a plane, and runs a 3D finite element (FEM) simulation to certify and assess the quality of each trajectory. To compute secure candidate grasp locations, we use a continuous spring model of thin, inhomogeneous deformable objects with linear energy potential. Experiments show that this method produces many of the same grasps as an exhaustive optimization with an FEM mesh, but is orders of magnitude cheaper: our method runs in O(v log v) time, where v is the number of veins, while the FEM computation takes O(pn3) time, where n is the number of nodes in the FEM mesh and p is the number of nodes on its perimeter. Furthermore, we present a constant tissue curvature (CTC) retraction trajectory that distributes strain uniformly around the medial axis of the tissue. 3D FEM simulations show that the CTC achieves retractions with lower tissue strain than circular and linear trajectories. Overall, our algorithm computes and certifies a high-quality retraction in about one minute on a PC.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a method to extract surveillance graphs from occupancy grid maps. Surveillance graphs are part of the Graph-Clear framework and model the problem of detecting targets using multiple robots with limited range sensors. Robots can only execute basic actions called sweep and block on vertices and edges, respectively. Sweep detects targets in vertices and block prevents them from crossing edges. The extracted graphs accurately model the complexity of the planar environment to be searched, and are constructed as duals of the Voronoi Diagram. We give a geometric embedding for blocking and sweeping actions of the graph into the environment by directly associating them to sweep lines that robots cover with their sensors. This paper solves two open problems, namely the generation of surveillance graphs and the implementation of actions on a robot team. Sweep lines can then be directly translated into control inputs to the robot team. The new method is superior to previous heuristics for the extraction of graphs not only through its direct geometric relationship to the environment, but also due to its increased performance in direct experimental comparisons. Additionally, it provides a basis for possible theoretical results regarding the optimal coordination of multiple robots to detect targets in an arbitrary planar environment.",

The proposed method consists of three controllers for the DFP, i.e., a swinging up controller for a long pendulum, a controller to keep a long pendulum at the upright position and to swing up a short pendulum simultaneously, and a stabilization controller for both pendulums at the upright position. Since the second controller has two objectives, we use safe manual control[3] proposed by \u00c5 str\u00f6m and \u00c5 kesson. This paper proposes a novel application of the safe manual control. Swinging up and stabilization of the DFP was successfully achieved by appropriately switching three controllers. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by simulation and experiment.",

By synthesizing the ideas of a feature vector definition revealing the dynamical characteristics and an unsupervised clustering technique, the hierarchical segmentation is achieved. The identified mode can be regarded as a kind of symbol in the abstract model of the behavior. Second, the grammatical inference technique is introduced to develop the context-dependent grammar of the behavior, i.e., the symbolic dynamics of the human behavior. In addition, the behavior prediction based on the obtained symbolic model is performed.",

To achieve the synchronization, we propose a decentralized algorithm by designing impact law, which does not depend on the position of the robot, but on the time information. Specifically, \u00bfthe time interval between two consecutive impacts\u00bf is exchanged when the robots meet. We also show how to apply the synchronization algorithm to a planar patrolling problem. Simulation results show the feasibility and robustness of our algorithm.",

The goal is to design output feedback control such that the resulting path of a mobile robot satisfies desired linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications. Our control strategy is divided into a local output feedback control problem and a supervisory control for LTL specifications. For the former one, we design output feedback control laws to ensure that output trajectories either remain in a simplex, or leave the simplex and enter an adjacent simplex in finite time. For the latter, we construct a transition system based on reachability and search for feasible paths that satisfy the LTL specifications. In this way, a piecewise affine output feedback control is obtained to solve the motion planning problem. A simulation result is presented to illustrate our approach.",

The coherence between several performance indicators of different system components, as well as the influence of environmental parameters on the system, are learned and quantitatively evaluated. Performance evaluation of an autonomous robot navigating in two different urban environments is conducted and presented results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.",

Due to the fact that there are usually much more objects than the number of PTZ cameras, the system first assigns a subset of the requests/objects to each PTZ camera. The PTZ cameras then select the parameter settings that best satisfy the assigned competing requests to provide high resolution views of the moving objects. We solve the request assignment and the camera parameter selection problems in real time. The effectiveness of the proposed system is validated in comparison with an existing work using simulation. The simulation results show that in heavy traffic scenarios, our algorithm increases the number of observed objects by over 200%.",

The basic idea is to direct robots' explorative movements to grow \u00bftentacles\u00bf from entities and establish links when tentacles meet. This approach can self-heal failures of robots and improve communication coverage and quality over time. Experiments in simulations and real robots have shown positive results.",

It is spanning an arc from the expectations and requirements of store owners and customers, via the challenges of the shopping scenario and the operating environment, the implemented functionality of the shopping guide robots, up to the results of long-term field trials. The field trials started in April 2008 and still ongoing aim at studying whether and how a group of interactive mobile shopping guide robots can operate completely autonomously in such everyday environments and how they are accepted by uninstructed customers. In these field trials, where nine robotic shopping guides traveled together 2187 kilometers in three different home improvement stores in Germany, more than 8,600 customers were successfully guided to the locations of their products of choice. With the successful development of these shopping guide robots, a further important step towards assistive robotics for daily use has been done.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present our work on enabling smart cameras to act as autonomous vision systems for mobile service robots. The smart cameras will adapt their functionality to the current task of the robot system. Instead of transferring raw image data, higher level image information or regions-of-interest are transmitted. This way, the amount of data is reduced and computationally intensive image interpretation will not affect other tasks of the robot system. We are developing a flexible software solution to integrate smart camera systems to the architecture of our robot system. Each image processing task is constructed by a composition of modular functions that can be distributed over different systems. Timing aspects of the flow of data can be analyzed with different tools to evaluate the performance. For this work we are using a commercially available smart camera, but due to the use of a modular architecture the porting to other camera models is easy. We show the advantages of our approach in a setup where image regions containing a face are detected and extracted for further processing steps. This task is accomplished using different setups, where more or fewer subtasks are assigned to the camera system. The performance of the overall system is evaluated with respect to processor load, network load and latency of image data.",

One possible task to determine an optimal camera placement is to obtain high resolvability, or equivalently, to optimize a perceptibility measure which is a quantitative scaling measure from error of the measured velocity of image features in the image plane to error of the corresponding velocity computed in the camera coordinate frame. This paper first shows that optimization of the perceptibility measure may produce unreasonable motion responses for active vision systems, and it should not be selected for a primary task to control active vision systems. This paper then proposes target tracking as a primary task and optimization of a perceptibility measure as a secondary task. The perceptibility measure for the secondary task is induced by certain Jacobian matrices, not the image Jacobian matrix, to produce cooperative behavior for active vision systems with multiple cameras.",

        "abstract": "To increase autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) safety and efficiency on outdoor terrains the vehicle's control system should have settings for individual terrain surfaces. A first step in such a terrain-dependent control system is classification of the surface upon which the AGV is traversing. This paper considers vision-based terrain surface classification for the path directly in front of the vehicle (\u00bf 1 m). Most visionbased terrain classification has focused on terrain traversability and not on terrain surface classification. The few approaches to classifying traversable terrain surfaces, with the exception of the use of infrared cameras to classify mud, have relied on stand-alone cameras that are designed for daytime use and are not expected to perform well in the dark. In contrast, this research uses a laser stripe-based structured light sensor, which uses a laser in conjunction with a camera, and hence can work at night. Also, unlike most previous results, the classification here does not rely on color since color changes with illumination and weather, and certain terrains have multiple colors (e.g., sand may be red or white). Instead, it relies only on spatial relationships, specifically spatial frequency response and texture, which captures spatial relationships between different gray levels. Terrain surface classification using each of these features separately is conducted by using a probabilistic neural network. Experimental results based on classifying four outdoor terrains demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",

        "abstract": "Many researchers have studied on walking stability controls for biped robots. Most of them are highly accurate acceleration controls based on the mechanics model of the robot. However, the control algorithms are difficult to be applied to human-carrying biped robots due to modeling errors. In the previous report, we proposed the landing pattern modification method, but it had a problem that a foot landing impact increased when a walking speed became fast. So, we propose a new terrain-adaptive control that can reduce a landing- impact force. To increase a concave terrain adaptation, we set a target landing position beneath a reference level. To reduce the landing-impact force, we change the position gain control value to a small value at a swing phase. Moreover, we set landing-foot speed at zero after detecting a foot-landing by the force sensor mounted on a foot. To follow uneven terrain, a virtual spring is installed to the vertical direction after detecting a foot-landing on a ground, and a virtual compliance control is applied to the roll and pitch axes. In a stable walk while carrying a 65 kg human on uneven terrain, the new control method decreased the landing-impact force than the previous terrain-adaptive control.",

In particular, the proposed solution aims at managing actuator velocity saturations by dynamically scaling task velocity commands so that the hierarchy of task priorities is preserved in spite of actuator velocity saturations. The approach is tested on a specific case study where the NSB elaborates the motion directives for a team of six mobile robots that has to entrap and to escort a target. The approach is validated by numerical simulations and by experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Tracking multiple people in crowded and cluttered dynamic scenes is a very difficult task in robotic vision due to the highly frequent occlusion and lack of visibility of objects. In this paper, we present a manifold learning based multiple people tracking approach with occlusion reasoning to solve this problem. In our previous work, a new Intrinsic Variable Preserving Manifold Learning (IVPML) method is proposed, by which the continuity of the intrinsic motion variables for tracking is preserved on a new manifold after dimensionality reduction. In this paper, the IVPML method is extended to be applied to tracking multiple people with occlusion situations. Associated with spatio-temporal continuity of tracking and IVPML method, a novel robust occlusion reasoning method is proposed during the alternations of multiple people. For occlusion recovery, region covariance representation including both spatial and statistic properties of objects are used to detect people after occlusion. The multiple people tracking method has been successfully applied to mobile robotic visual tracking system in several complicated environments. Comparisons and experimental results have shown the effectiveness of the new algorithm in various situations.",

The dynamical servo control aims to access generic points in the state space not just the equilibrium points. Stabilizing of generic points is impossible and a possible way is to stabilize some periodic orbits passing through the desired points. Virtual constraints are used to generate such orbits. By analyzing the integration of the zero dynamics of the Acrobot subjected to virtual constraints, conditions of whether there is an orbit passing through the desired point and the orbit function are found. A cascade control strategy is proposed to stabilize both the virtual constraint and the orbit function which decides the system behavior. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the control law.",

In this paper, we present the instantaneous leg extension model of virtual slope walking to analyze the essentials of virtual slope walking. It has two straight massless legs and a point mass body at the hip. The stance leg is extended instantaneously while the swing leg is swung and shortened actively. We demonstrate that this model can exhibit stable walking cycles on level ground. We obtain the sufficient conditions for the existence of the fixed point. We then illustrate the effect of the model parameters on the fixed point to show how the fixed point can be determined by adjusting the parameters. Further, we theoretically proved that the fixed point is asymptotically stable, meaning that it is independent on the initial conditions. The validity of the proposed model has been examined by numerical simulations.",

        "abstract": "A simple flexible technique is proposed to easily calibrate five intrinsic parameters a camera based on the three side lengths of a triangle. The technique only requires taking the template with a triangle, and matching the three vertices of the triangle between the template and its image. Analytical solution is given to guarantee algorithm accomplishment successfully. The essential relations for intrinsic parameters of camera were discussed in theory and the calibration algorithm efficiency was rigorously and completely analyzed. At present depth estimation of an object in computer vision and robotics is most commonly done by triangulating and estimating distance from two cameras. Depth estimation from a camera is deeply investigated in this paper. The real data experimental results show that the techniques are very simple high accurate and efficient.",

This robot is composed of a hemisphere-shaped shell and a 2-d.o.f. mass-control device (pendulum) inside it, and undergoes the rolling contact constraint between the hemispherical surface of the robot and the ground. Unlike a lot of non-holonomic robots which have ever been researched, the drift term exists in the system of the hemisphere robot. First, we show basic concepts which the hemisphere robot has, and construct the kinetic model of this robot. Then we realize the locomotion control of the robot by periodically oscillating the internal pendulum and show its effectiveness by control experiments.",

The robot conducts a goal-directed based interaction to establish engagement between the child and robot in order to establish a beneficial learning environment for autistic children. An unsupervised Mixture Gaussian-based cluster method is proposed to detect the child's intention in real time to process the goal-directed task smoothly. The novelty of this approach is that does not require the use of any training data or a trained model to detect the child's intention. Our autonomous robotic system is tested with several autistic children at a School for the Disabled in Nagoya, Japan. The results of the initial interaction showed that the children enjoyed interaction with and feedback from the robot, which confirmed that the robot can be used as mediator or an object of joint attention. The unsupervised approach was able to detect the children's intention at every time segment to process the goal-directed task with a higher accuracy rate. The results of the goal-directed task showed that the proposed interaction was highly effective in enhancing their joint attention. Since most of the children attempted to imitate the robot's gestural behaviors and used a variety of learning patterns to attend to the robot's fingered object in the environment to obtain joint attention with robot.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We propose a Thereminist robot system that plays the Theremin based on a Theremin's pitch model. The theremin, which is a 1920s electronic musical instrument, is played by moving a player's hand position in the air without touching it. It is difficult to play the Theremin because the relationship between the hand position and Theremin's pitch (pitch characteristics) is non-linear and varies according to the electromagnetic field (hereafter called environment). These characteristics cause two problems: (1) adapting to the environment change is required and (2) a nai\u00bfve design tends to depend on robot's particular hardware. We implement the coarse-to-fine control system on the Thereminist robot using newly proposed two pitch models: parametric and nonparametric ones. The Thereminist robot works as below: first, the robot calibrates the pitch model by parameter fitting with the Levenberg-Marquardt method. Second, the robot moves its hand in a coarse manner by feedforward control based on the pitch model. Finally, the robot adjusts its position by feedback control (proportional-integral control). In these steps, the robot can play a required pitch quickly, because the robot moves its hand using the pitch model without listening to the Theremin's sound Thus, the time to play the exact pitch is shorter than when only feedback control is used. Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the robustness against the number of samples, environment change, and types of robots. The results revealed that our pitch model describes using only 12 samples of pitches for estimation of the parameters, and adapts if the environment changes. In addition, our system works on two different robots: HRP-2 and ASIMO.",

The main idea is to build hybrid (3DOF) mechanism, which avoids the drawbacks of the serial and parallel mechanisms. The new solution has to merge the advantages of both classical (serial and parallel) structures in order to achieve optimal performances. The proposed mechanism can be used as a solution for several modules in humanoid robot. The hip mechanism is taken as an example to illustrate the contribution of this paper. To evaluate the performances of the system, simulation of this new mechanism is carried out with Adams software. Geometrical and Kinematic models are developed and included in the simulation tool. Based on biomechanical data, analysis of the new kinematic structure is carried out. The design of the proposed solution is then described. Finally the first prototype developed for the HYDRO\u00efD robot's hip is presented. This mechanism is a part of an International patent accepted at INPI- France.",

        "abstract": "We have developed a new, three dimensional vocal tract mechanical model for an anthropomorphic talking robot WT-7R (Waseda Talker No. 7 Refined), to improve the resonance of the vocal tract. The Waseda Talker robot series aims to reproduce the human speech mechanism with three-dimensional accuracy. The tongue of the previous model, WT-7 (Waseda Talker No. 7), was made of rigid links and covered with a thermoplastic rubber (Septon). This mechanism could deform the tongue shape and work as a part of the vocal tract, however, the cover thickness was not sufficient enough to prevent sound leakage, and did not have sufficient resonance. As a result, the produced sounds were unclear. To resolve this problem, the inner area of the tongue was filled with liquid. We experimented to select the filling liquid which is minimizes damage to the Septon cover and provides adequate resonance characteristics. The ethylene glycol was selected because it does little damage to the Septon and is relatively non-flammable. An oil seal and liquid gasket prevent leakage into the robot. WT-7 also has problems with its tongue link deformation range and open lip control range\u2014these problems were also addressed. The improvements made the vowel production of WT-7R clearer than that of the previous robot, and the bandwidth of the formant peak in spectral analysis became sharper.",

Our approach dynamically decouples these two motions, stabilizes pitch motion in the sagittal plane via the Limit Cycle Walking approach, introduces robustness for this motion using energy feedback control, and robustness for roll motion based on reference trajectory feedback tracking control. The roll reference trajectory is generated via analysis of the impact dynamics. Performance is verified via simulations.",

        "abstract": "Various types of actuation methods for intravascular locomotive microrobot have been proposed and demonstrated. Among the actuation methods, electromagnetic based actuation (EMA) was considered as a promising mechanism. In generally, planar EMA systems for 2 dimensional movement of the microrobot were proposed and demonstrated. In this paper, we present 3 dimensional (D) EMA systems for the 3D space locomotion of the microrobot. The proposed system consists of a coil system and a robotic actuation system. The coil system has a pair of Helmholtz coils and a pair of Maxwell coils, and the robotic actuation system has a serial robot structure with roll-pitch-roll rotational axes which can rotate about three orthogonal axes (X, Y and Z). Finally, through experiments, we can demonstrate 3D movement of the microrobot by using the proposed EMA system. The proposed EMA system can be utilized for the 3D actuation of the intravascular microrobot.",

These assistants may apply non-desired efforts to the patient abdomen. Therefore, this article proposes a control methodology based on three feedback levels, which have been defined as layers. These layers control different aspects of the endoscope movement. A low level assures the dynamic of the robot assistant is performed accordingly. The mid level emulates a passive wrist behavior to avoid any efforts over the abdomen. An external high level deals with the global movement planning. This architecture also makes easier to analyze the stability of the whole system. Finally, a real in-vitro experiment has been implemented with an industrial robot in order to contrast the validity of this article procedure.",

In this paper we present a general approach for topological SLAM (simultaneous localisation and mapping) which does not require motion or odometry information but only a sequence of noisy measurements from visited places. We propose a particle filtering technique for topological SLAM which relies on a method for disambiguating places which appear indistinguishable using neighbourhood information extracted from the sequence of observations. The algorithm aims to induce a small topological map which is consistent with the observations and simultaneously estimate the location of the robot. The proposed approach is evaluated using a data set of sonar measurements from an indoor environment which contains several similar places. It is demonstrated that our approach is capable of dealing with severe ambiguities and, and that it infers a small map in terms of vertices which is consistent with the sequence of observations.",

        "abstract": "A large-scale navigation system for autonomous off-road robots is presented which uses a topological map to navigate to a previously unseen target location. During path traversal, the system relies on a local navigation layer to avoid obstacles not modeled in the map. Data from this local layer is abstracted to learn both realistic topological edge cost measures and local traversability maps which allow more efficient route selection during topological exploration. On the topological level, a technique to handle impassable route segments in the map is presented and an exploration strategy that allows to discover new routes to the goal is introduced. The performance of the proposed concept is experimentally validated on the robot RAVON at the 2nd Military European Land Robot Trial 2008.",

        "abstract": "Topological visual maps contain different abstraction levels of information that can be used by robots to carry out different activities. We propose here a new hierarchical structure in which landmarks extracted from conventional images are grouped creating a graph of planar regions. The new hierarchy improves previous approaches based on images reducing both, the size of the graph and its complexity. In order to segment and group the planar regions of a sequence of images a new approach based on the simultaneous matching of two images and the previously extracted planar regions is proposed. We also consider multi-plane restrictions so that the method is robust to the appearance of new planes. The paper presents two contributions. First the triple matching approach to extract all the planes seen in the set of images and second a new topological map construction based on a graph of planar regions which can be used by mobile robots to localize and move in the environment. Experiments with real images in both indoor and outdoor environments show good performance of our proposal.",

Toward this goal, we present a novel computer vision based hand posture recognition system to serve as an intelligent interface for skill transfer in robotic manipulation. We use the inner distance shape context (IDSC) as a hand shape descriptor to capture variations in the hand state (open or closed) under large in-plane rotations and considerable out-of-plane rotations. The proposed technique is further examined in applications involving grasp recognition and gesture based communications. The experiments show that the proposed approach can be generalized to recognizing a selected taxonomy of grasp types. At present, skin color is used to segment the hand region from the scene, but this method has its own limitations. We show preliminary results suggesting that the IDSC can be used to segment parts of the articulated object, including segmenting the hand from the human body silhouette without using skin color information.",

Also, when the human walks, the sway of the waist is smaller than most of the humanoid robot's one. By compensating the angular momentum of the robot and by modifying the ZMP trajectory, we show that sway of the robot's waist can be smaller.

Most SLAM systems, such as FastSLAM, also require a single connected run to create a map. In this paper we present a system of visual mapping, using only input from a stereo camera, that continually updates an optimized metric map in large indoor spaces with movable objects: people, furniture, partitions, etc. The system can be stopped and restarted at arbitrary disconnected points, is robust to occlusion and localization failures, and efficiently maintains alternative views of a dynamic environment. It operates completely online at a 30 Hz frame rate.",

        "abstract": "Research in rehabilitation engineering shows that electrodes can produce tactile sensations with appropriate electrical signals tailored to stimulate the multiple tactile receptors located under the fingertip skin. However, electrical stimulation that is suitable in terms of current or voltage level for tactile sensations experienced from an individual cannot be guaranteed for every user; the dynamic range is largely dependent on the user. An identification method is then necessary for characterizing the parameters of the skin-electrode interface circuit model as to improve rendering consistency and comfort for every user regardless of skin condition. In this paper, we focus on developing a custom-built electro-tactile display terminal for data collection and an identification method to determine the individual bio-impedance parameters based on the well-known skin-electrode interface circuit model: the Cole-Cole circuit model. The goal of this work is to develop an online identification and stimulation current control approach for enhancement of electro-tactile-based rendering in applications such as rehabilitation, sensory substitution, telepresence, etc.",

We formulates the target tracking as a multi-objective optimization problem which integrates the tracking quality, the energy saving and the network connectivity. To cope with sensing noises, we use the determinant of the covariance matrix of target estimation as the tracking quality measure and compute its partial derivatives for the optimization process. Virtual nodes are introduced to represent obstacles in the environment. Furthermore this algorithm can be extended to solve the problem of source tracking where sensors can only detect the density of the diffusing substances emitted by the source. Therefore a whole tracking framework has been set up which can be easily extended for applications under complicated situations. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in energy conservation and tracking accuracy under different situations.",

To compare our image processing algorithm with standard object recognition methods we also developed several traffic light recognition systems based on learning processes such as cascade classifiers with AdaBoost. Our system was validated in real conditions in our prototype vehicle and also using registered video sequence from various countries (France, China, and U.S.A.).

In this paper, dynamic saturations are handled by means of a real-time technique based on a trajectory scaling method: whenever saturations occur, trajectories are automatically scaled by means of a dynamic filter in order to preserve an accurate path tracking. Commonly known scaling algorithms only consider the existence of torque saturations. In this paper, the strategy is enriched by also accounting for torque derivatives constraints. The solution proposed is suited to be used in conjunction with standard inverse dynamics controllers. The adopted methodology explicitly requires the realtime evaluation of the derivative of the manipulator inertia matrix. To this purpose, a novel efficient procedure is proposed.",

        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) application using data obtained from a microwave radar sensor. The radar scanner is based on the frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) technology. In order to overcome the complexity of radar image analysis, a trajectory-oriented EKF-SLAM technique using data from a 360\u00b0 field of view radar sensor has been developed. This process makes no landmark assumptions and avoids the data association problem. The method of egomotion estimation makes use of the Fourier-Mellin transform for registering radar images in a sequence, from which the rotation and translation of the sensor motion can be estimated. In the context of the scan-matching SLAM, the use of the Fourier-Mellin transform is original and provides an accurate and efficient way of computing the rigid transformation between consecutive scans. Experimental results on real-world data are presented. Moreover a performance evaluation of the results is carried out. A comparative study between the output data of the proposed method and the data processed with smoothing approaches to SLAM is also achieved.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores methods and representations that allow two perceptually heterogeneous robots, each of which represents concepts via grounded properties, to transfer knowledge despite their differences. This is an important issue, as it will be increasingly important for robots to communicate and effectively share knowledge to speed up learning as they become more ubiquitous. We use Ga\u00bfrdenfors' conceptual spaces to represent objects as a fuzzy combination of properties such as color and texture, where properties themselves are represented as Gaussian Mixture Models in a metric space. We then use confusion matrices that are built using instances from each robot, obtained in a shared context, in order to learn mappings between the properties of each robot. These mappings are then used to transfer a concept from one robot to another, where the receiving robot was not previously trained on instances of the objects. We show in a 3D simulation environment that these models can be successfully learned and concepts can be transferred between a ground robot and an aerial quadrotor robot.",

The algorithm is based on key features onboard the UAV to estimate the vehicle's position and orientation. The algorithm is validated against onboard sensors and known 3D positions, showing that the proposed camera configuration robustly estimates the helicopter's position with an adequate resolution, improving the position estimation, especially the height estimation. The obtained results show that the proposed algorithm is suitable to complement or replace the GPS-based position estimation in situations where GPS information is unavailable or where its information is inaccurate, allowing the vehicle to develop tasks at low heights, such as autonomous landing, take-off, and positioning, using the extracted 3D information as a visual feedback to the flight controller.",

We extract buildings from aerial images and construct a 3D model of buildings, using the fundamental matrix. We estimate the global pose of the vehicle by matching 3D structure of buildings with satellite images, using a particle filter.

A careful analysis of the properties of the Pl\u00fccker coordinates, defined in the projective space \u21195, permits their direct usage for undelayed initialization. Immediately after detection of a segment in the image, a Pl\u00fccker line is incorporated in the map. A single Gaussian pdf includes inside its 2-sigma region all possible lines given the observed segment, from arbitrarily close up to the infinity range, and in any orientation. The lines converge to stable 3D configurations as the moving camera gathers observations from new viewpoints. The line's endpoints, maintained out of the map, are constantly retro-projected from the image onto the line's local reference frame. An extending-only policy is defined to update them. We validate the method via Monte Carlo simulations and with real imagery data.",

However, with the limitation of robot motor capability, a robot may not be able to duplicate human motor skills with the same motor performance. To alleviate the problem, one of the possible solutions is to know robot motor capability in advance. Thus, we develop a quantitative measure of a robot motor system, called a pseudo index of motor performance (pIp), and utilize it to compare with the index of performance (Ip) of a human motor system. To investigate the Ip, we propose an information-theory-based method to characterize a robot motor system. Computer simulations and experiments with a PUMA 560 robot will be conducted to validate the proposed information-theory-based method.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we discuss the common stabilization mechanism underlying passive dynamic walking (PDW) and passive dynamic running (PDR), focusing on the feedback structures in analytical Poincar\u00e9 maps. To this end, we have derived linearized analytical Poincar\u00e9 maps for PDW and PDR, and analyzed these stabilities on two models, namely models with elastic elements and with stiff legs. Through our theoretical analysis, we have found an \u201cimplicit two-delay feedback structure\u201d, which can be seen as a certain type of two-delay input digital feedback control developed as an artificial control structure in the field of control theory, is an inherent stabilization mechanism in PDR appearing from the model with elastic elements, and two-period and four-period PDW appearing from with stiff legs. This mechanism is the key to adaptive function underlying phase transition phenomenon between PDW and PDR and period-doubling bifurcation phenomenon in PDW. To the best of our knowledge, this has not yet to be addressed and studied so far. Our results shed new light on the common underlying principle of passive dynamic locomotion, including biped PDW and PDR",

In this project, perception plays an important role by giving an estimate of the speed of surface winds, the state of the sea surface and the rate of precipitation in wet weather. In this paper, the unknown signals are first encoded with different codes (ERB, MFCC, LPC, LPCC). Then the coded signals are modeled by two different methods of classification: predictive and k-nearest neighbor. The final part of the system uses local and global decision to recognize the class of the unknown signal. Experiments are conducted to compare the results obtained by different encodings. Our results show that MFCC does not represent the ideal approach for the recognition of underwater audio signals, but LPCC seems to be a better candidate.",

        "abstract": "Human-robot interaction using free hand gestures is gaining more importance as more untrained humans are operating robots in home and office environments. The robot needs to solve three problems to be operated by free hand gestures: gesture (command) detection, action generation (related to the domain of the task) and association between gestures and actions. In this paper we propose a novel technique that allows the robot to solve these three problems together learning the action space, the command space, and their relations by just watching another robot operated by a human operator. The main technical contribution of this paper is the introduction of a novel algorithm that allows the robot to segment and discover patterns in its perceived signals without any prior knowledge of the number of different patterns, their occurrences or lengths. The second contribution is using a Ganger-causality based test to limit the search space for the delay between actions and commands utilizing their relations and taking into account the autonomy level of the robot. The paper also presents a feasibility study in which the learning robot was able to predict actor's behavior with 95.2% accuracy after monitoring a single interaction between a novice operator and a WOZ operated robot representing the actor.",

We hereby propose a hierarchical structure model to solve the tracking problem by SIR (Sampling Importance Resampling) particle filter with partitioned sampling. The image spatial and temporal information is used to track the human body and estimate the human posture. When doing the human-machine interaction, a static monocular camera may not get plenty of information from 2D images, so we must move the camera platform to a better position for acquiring more enriched image information. The proposed upper body tracking technique will then adjust to estimating the human posture during the camera moving. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed tracking approach, extensive experiments have been performed, of which the result appear to be quite promising.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In the recent decades much research has been performed in order to allow better control of arc welding processes, but the success has been limited, and the vast majority of the industrial structural welding work is therefore still being made manually. Closed-loop and nearly-closed-loop control of the processes requires the extraction of characteristic parameters of the welding groove close to the molten pool, i.e. in an environment dominated by the very intense light emission from the welding arc. The typical industrial solution today is a laser-scanner containing a camera as well as a laser source illuminating the groove by a light curtain and thus allowing details of the groove geometry to be extracted by triangulation. This solution is relatively expensive and must act several centimetres ahead of the molten pool. In addition laser-scanners often show problems when dealing with shiny surfaces. It is highly desirable to extract groove features closer to the arc and thus facilitate for a nearly-closed-loop control situation. On the other hand, for performing seam tracking and nearly-closed-loop control it is not necessary to obtain very detailed information about the molten pool area as long as some important features are obtained, e.g. the groove position and gap width. To obtain these features without external illumination, a new image analysis scheme based on active contour models was proposed and verified by experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Programming a humanoid robot to perform an action that takes the robot's complex dynamics into account is a challenging problem. Traditional approaches typically require highly accurate prior knowledge of the robot's dynamics and environment in order to devise complex control algorithms for generating a stable dynamic motion. Training using human motion capture is an intuitive and flexible approach to programming a robot but directly applying motion capture data to a robot usually results in dynamically unstable motion. Optimization using high-dimensional motion capture data in the humanoid full-body joint-space is also typically intractable. In previous work, we proposed an approach that uses dimensionality reduction to achieve tractable imitation-based learning in humanoids without the need for a physics-based dynamics model. This work was based on a 3-D \u201ceigenpose\u201d representation. However, for some motion patterns, using only three dimensions for eigenposes is insufficient. In this paper, we propose a new method for motion optimization based on high-dimensional eigenpose data. A one-dimensional computationally efficient motion-phase optimization method is implemented along with a newly developed cylindrical coordinate transformation technique for hyperdimensional subspaces. This results in a fast learning algorithm and very accurate motion imitation. We demonstrate the new algorithm on a Fujitsu HOAP-2 humanoid robot model in a dynamic simulator and show that a dynamically stable sidestep motion can be successfully learned by imitating a human demonstrator.",

The second approach adds incremental binning to improve the quality of the solution while still keeping the dimensionality of the search space relatively low. These approaches provide a better compromise of speed and quality of the solution than most existing approaches, and are able to successfully utilize linear landmarks in large outdoor environments.",

        "abstract": "The predictive interactive graphical interface (PIGI) is a suite of tools developed at NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC) for supervising robots across expected Earth-moon time delays (5-10 second round trip). These tools improve interaction between a human supervisor and a remote robot by mitigating the effects of the time delay. Using a combination of robot behavior prediction and task queuing, PIGI enables the supervisor to reduce robot idle time, which leads to more efficient completion of the tasks. PIGI was used in 2007 and 2008 to remotely command five different NASA robots in Arizona, California, Texas, and Washington, all from a single location at JSC in Houston.",

        "abstract": "Usually, the identification of the dynamic parameters of robot makes use of the inverse dynamic model which is linear with respect to the parameters. This model is sampled while the robot is tracking exciting trajectories. This allows using linear least squares (LS) techniques to estimate the parameters. The efficiency of this method has been proved through experimental identifications of a lot of prototypes and industrial robots. However, it is known that LS estimators are sensitive to outliers and leverage points. Thus, it may be helpful to verify their reliability. This is possible by using robust regressions and residual analysis. Then, we compare the results with those obtained with classical LS regression. This paper deals with this issue and introduces the experimental identification and residual analysis of an one degree of freedom (DOF) haptic interface using the Huber's estimator. To verify the pertinence of our analyses, this comparison is also performed on a medical interface consisting of a complex mechanical structure.",

        "abstract": "Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) based on visual information is a challenging problem. One of the main problems with visual SLAM is to find good quality landmarks, that can be detected despite noise and small changes in viewpoint. Many approaches use SIFT interest points as visual landmarks. The problem with the SIFT interest points detector, however, is that it results in a large number of points, of which many are not stable across observations. We propose the use of local symmetry to find regions of interest instead. Symmetry is a stimulus that occurs frequently in everyday environments where our robots operate in, making it useful for SLAM. Furthermore, symmetrical forms are inherently redundant, and can therefore be more robustly detected. By using regions instead of points-of-interest, the landmarks are more stable. To test the performance of our model, we recorded a SLAM database with a mobile robot, and annotated the database by manually adding ground-truth positions. The results show that symmetrical regions-of-interest are less susceptible to noise, are more stable, and above all, result in better SLAM performance.",

        "abstract": "Road network information (RNI) simplifies autonomous driving by providing strong priors about driving environments. Its usefulness has been demonstrated in the DARPA Urban Challenge. However, the need to manually generate RNI prevents us from fully exploiting its benefits. We envision an aerial image analysis system that automatically generates RNI for a route between two urban locations. As a step toward this goal, we present an algorithm that extracts the structure of a parking lot visible in an aerial image. We formulate this task as a problem of parking spot detection because extracting parking lot structures is closely related to detecting all of the parking spots. To minimize human intervention in use of aerial imagery, we devise a self-supervised learning algorithm that automatically obtains a set of canonical parking spot templates to learn the appearance of a parking lot and estimates the structure of the parking lot from the learned model. The data set extracted from a single image alone is too small to sufficiently learn an accurate parking spot model. To remedy this insufficient positive data problem, we utilize self-supervised parking spots obtained from other aerial images as prior information and a regularization technique to avoid an overfitting solution.",

From the implementation point of view, the VPass is useful because it can be appended upon any existing navigation algorithms.

This paper focuses on a series clutch actuator based on magnetorheological fluid which allows a fast, electrical change of the impedance while maintaining good force tracking. In particular the mechanical clutch can alter the high-frequency impedance, decoupling the motor inertia and thus reducing impact forces. We present the mechanical clutch design and a control system architecture to automatically adjust the fluid magnetization level and leverage the clutch benefits. Experiments verify torque tracking and impact force reduction both in autonomous and telerobotic operation. The actuator was designed and manufactured in collaboration with the Materials Design Institute at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and is tested in a single degree of freedom demonstration.",

This is necessary for mobile robots navigating in dynamic environments that have moving obstacles with associated costs, such as personal space around people or buffer zones around dangerous vehicles. Our approach is to modify the search space used by the A* algorithm, increasing the size of grid cells further from the robot. This approach relies on the notion that only the area closest to the robot needs to be searched carefully; areas further from the robot can be searched more coarsely. Because the planner is assumed to run repeatedly as the robot moves, the robot will always have a fine-grained path defined for its next action. We have experimentally verified in simulation that this algorithm can be run in real-time and produces paths that are comparable to full-resolution planning.",

The vehicle 3D dead reckoning is computed using a wheel encoder and an IMU. Dead reckoning is corrected from three different sources: a) using a tilted lidar for road detection and computation of the vehicle position within the road which is then corrected towards a 2D road centerline map given in advance. b) DGPS 2D or 3D data as available. c) Under tree foliage DGPS blackouts commonly occur, specially when measuring height, therefore the use of a barometer for correcting height is proposed. An extended Kalman filter is used for sensor fusion and pose estimation. Finally, the estimated vehicle height is added to the 2D map obtaining a 3D road centerline map with width (measured by the tilted lidar). Thoroughly experimentation on real mountainous woodland paths show the usefulness and robustness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "]For mobile robots to navigate autonomously, knowing with certainty their location is fundamental. However, this is difficult when operating in complex outdoors environments, and often results are inaccurate. To guarantee the certainty of the location estimates, the notion of integrity is used. This is a measure of the degree of confidence that provides a guaranteed location zone. The process consists in removing outliers amongst the measurements using Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) algorithms and then to compute Protection Levels (PL) that quantify the integrity zone. This is applicable mainly to Global Navigation Satellite Sytems (GNSS) in the aerospace domain where data redundancy exists and few multipath, which is not the case for land applications. In this paper, a new approach to localization integrity for land mobile robots is proposed by combining vehicle and GNSS data, stored within a short-term memory, the data horizon. This formulation allows for the application of FDE algorithms on the combined data set. It also leads to a gain of redundancy that enables PLs to be reduced and to increase the availability of integrity algorithms.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a co-learning particle filter approach for vehicle tracking, which is very important for intelligent vehicle. The proposal distribution of the particle filter is a combination of an extra support vector machine (SVM) detector and the motion prior. Previous works focusing on how to online update the detector or the observation likelihood using the tracking results. These approaches belong to \u00bfself-learning\u00bf fashion and easily tend to drift. The major difference between the proposed approach and previous works is that the SVM detector and the likelihood function can be mutually updated in a co-learning manner. By adopting the co-learning technology, the unlabelled samples which are generated during tracking are utilized to progressively modify the SVM detector and update the observation likelihood; therefore the resulting tracker is more robust and effectively avoids the drift problem. Finally, the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using extensive real visual tracking examples.",

Despite significant research, existing solutions are limited in their ability to handle heterogeneous constraints within highly dynamic or uncertain environments. This paper presents a novel maneuver selection technique suited for both 2D and 3D environments with highly dynamic maneuvering constraints and multiple mobile obstacles. Agents may have any arbitrary set of nonholonomic control variables; maneuvers can be constrained by a broad class of function inequalities, including time-dependent constraints involving nonlinear relationships between controlled and agent-state variables. The resulting algorithm has been implemented to run in real time using only a fraction of the CPU's capacity on an ordinary notebook computer and performs well in a number of taxing simulated situations.",

Therefore we propose to use the already developed rad-hardened viewing tool to feed an oscillation observer with visual information.

        "abstract": "Mechanical backlash is a common trouble in all servo mechanisms that is created by mechanical defects i.e. wear or looseness. Backlash imposes nonlinearity on a linear control system and may be contributed to a limit cycle. Considering mechanical subsystem of a servo axis as an elastic two-mass system, modeling the backlash with a dead zone and choosing reduced order control system for the speed and current controller, the frequency bandwidth of vibration is estimated. The estimated frequency is supported by the experimental vibration analysis of six different machine tools. To eliminate unwanted vibration, a backlash detection and suppression approach is proposed in this paper. In the case of vibration, load sensor is disregarded and the regulator conducts the setting speed of interpolator to the drive. Then stability is satisfied with the cost of some tracking error. When stability is detected load sensor is considered and the regulator output converges to the speed provided by the position control. To examine the approach, dynamic model of a real servo axis is obtained and it is validated by experimental data. Then the proposed modified control system is simulated.",

        "abstract": "For manipulating an unknown object a robot needs a 3D model of it. Given the limited field of view of a camera and self occlusions, a set of views is required to build a complete 3D model, so an important problem is how to select these views optimally according to certain criteria. We propose a novel algorithm to select the next-best-view (NBV) for a range camera to model 3D arbitrary objects. We use a volumetric representation and voxel labeling. We propose a new utility function based on factors considering voxel, quality and navigation information. We also propose two novel strategies to make faster the search of the NBV, one based on a hierarchical decomposition of the search space and other based on a multi-resolution of ray tracing. We have tested our planner in simulation with 7 different 3D objects, showing good results in terms of quality of the models and computation time required, and at the same time reducing the distance that the sensor has to travel to obtain the set of views.",

We show that this reconstruction is possible without performing a costly gradient descent-type optimization, and is based only on a single SVD. This new algorithm is shown to accurately reconstruct natural human motions, allowing them to be compared in 3D world coordinates, independent of the angle from which they were originally viewed.",

In this paper, we propose to adopt the accumulated block matching method to improve robustness against locally changing illumination, in which a template is split into small patches and matched by maximizing the average of the normalized correlations of all the patches.We also propose a localization criterion which helps the robot decide its motion.

        "abstract": "The tactile display for handheld devices requires compact hardware and useful applications. To satisfy these points, we have proposed the concept of `virtual active touch' that implements virtual exploration with a cursor on a screen through a pointing-stick-type tactile interface. The objective of this study is to present three-dimensional shapes on a two-dimensional screen without force feedback devices. It is possible to present three-dimensional shapes such as a bump using a lateral force. In order to represent human perception of geometric surface shape, instead of the lateral force, we use the cutaneous sensation of friction that occurs when a human finger strokes object surfaces. First, we confirmed that the virtual active touch interface could present cutaneous sense of friction. Second, we evaluated the perception of surface height in the context of bumped shape induced by the friction display. The experimental results agreed with our expectation that faster and longer increases in friction sensation were perceived as higher bumped shapes.",

The kinematic and dynamic properties of the head are analyzed and modeled using screw theory. The motion control algorithm is designed to receive, as an input, the output of a vision processing algorithm and to exploit the redundancy of the system for the realization of the movements. This algorithm is designed to enable the head to focus on and to follow a target, showing human-like motions. The performance of the control algorithm has been tested in a simulated environment and, then, experimentally applied to the real humanoid head.",

The tracking algorithm uses particle filtering with selective resampling based on a threshold and nearest neighbor data association for multiple targets.We describe results obtained from two tracking experiments: first with one vehicle and a second experiment with two targets.

For example, a robot in an unfamiliar home environment should be able to recognize the functionality of the rooms it visits, such as kitchen, living room, etc. We describe an approach to VPC based on sequential processing of images acquired with a conventional video camera. We identify two key challenges: Dealing with non-characteristic views and integrating restricted-FOV imagery into a holistic prediction. We present a solution to VPC based upon a recently-developed visual feature known as CENTRIST (CENsus TRansform hISTogram). We describe a new dataset for VPC which we have recently collected and are making publicly available. We believe this is the first significant, realistic dataset for the VPC problem. It contains the interiors of six different homes with ground truth labels. We use this dataset to validate our solution approach, achieving promising results.",

In the proposed approach, images of the environment are first sampled and stored as a set of ordered key images (visual path) and organized providing a visual memory of the environment. The robot navigation task is then defined as a concatenation of visual path subsets (called visual route) linking the current observed image and a target image belonging to the visual memory. The UAV is controlled to reach each image of the visual route using a vision-based control law adapted to its dynamic model and without explicitly planning any trajectory. This framework is largely substantiated by experiments with a X4-flyer equipped with a fisheye camera.",

The navigation framework relies on a monocular camera, and the path is represented as a series of key images. The varying reference is determined using a vector field, derived from the previous and next key images. Results in a simulated environment, as well as on a real robot, show the advantages of the varying reference, with respect to a fixed one, in the image, as well as in the 3D state space.",

To achieve this aim, an accurate localization is one of the preconditions. Due to the characteristics of our navigation environment, an elaborated visual odometry system is proposed to estimate the current position and orientation of the ACE platform. The existing algorithms of optical flow computation are experimentally evaluated and compared. The method based on pyramidal Lucas-Kanade algorithm with high-speed performance is selected. Based on the optical flow in 2D images, the camera ego-motion is estimated using image Jacobian matrix and least squares method. The kinematic model is set up to map the camera ego-motion to the robot motion. To eliminate systematic errors, a novel system calibration approach is proposed. Finally the odometry system is evaluated in experiments.",

In order to extract feature points in untextured condition, we divide an image into some sections and affect suitable processes for each section. This approach can also prevent concentration of feature points, and the influence with a moving object can be reduced. Robust motion estimation is attained using the framework of 3-point algorithm and RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC). Moreover, the accumulation error is reduced by keyframe adjustment. We present and evaluate experimental results for our system in outdoor environment. Proposed visual odometry system can localize the robot's position within 4% error in untextured outdoor environment.",

        "abstract": "To date, there exist only few works on the use of color images for visual servoing. Perhaps, this is due to the difficulties usually found to cope with illumination changes in these images. This paper presents new parametric models and optimization methods for robustly and directly registering color images. Direct methods refer to those that exploit the pixel intensities, without resorting to image features. We then show how a robust and generic visual servoing scheme can be constructed using the obtained optimal parameters. The proposed models ensure robustness to arbitrary illumination changes in color images, do not require prior knowledge (including the spectral ones) of the object, illuminants or camera, and naturally encompass gray-level images. Furthermore, the exploitation of all information within the images, even from areas where no features exist, allow the algorithm to achieve high levels of accuracy. Various results are reported to show that visual servoing can indeed be highly accurate and robust despite unknown objects and unknown imaging conditions.",

The vision-based control system relies on a color and feature based vision algorithm for target detection and tracking, Kalman filters for relative pose estimation, and a nonlinear controller for MAV stabilization and guidance. The vision algorithm relies on information from a single onboard camera. An arbitrary target can be selected in real-time from the ground control station, thereby outperforming template and learning-based approaches. Experimental results obtained from outdoor flight tests, showed that the vision-control system enabled the MAV to track and hover above the target as long as the battery is available.",

In contrast to most available methods, a single perspective camera is used to estimate the complete set of 3D motion parameters undergone by the UAV. We establish robust point correspondences between consecutive image frames captured by the flying vehicle. Based on the estimated motion parameters as well as the reconstructed relative scene depth, a visual steering algorithm has been realized so that the UAV is capable of avoiding obstacles during navigation. The advantage of our approach lies in the fact that decision for collision avoidance is made immediately, by using purely visual information extracted from the live video sequence. Furthermore, it eliminates the time-consuming steps of explicit obstacle recognition and global reconstruction of the environment. Experimental evaluation has been carried out based on computer simulation as well as using a commercially available flying drone. It has been shown that the UAV is capable of autonomous navigation in unknown environments with arbitrary configuration of obstacles.",

Omnidirectional cameras are a popular choice of visual sensors in robotics because the large field of view is well adapted to motion estimation and obstacle avoidance. The novelty of this work resides in simplifying the calibration phase by providing a direct approach to tracking without any prior knowledge of the camera, lens or mirror parameters. We deal with a nonlinear optimization problem that can be solved for small displacements between two images like those acquired at video rate by a camera mounted on a robot.

Based on a biomedical engineering analysis, we developed a new walking assist device with a concept to reduce the floor reaction force of the user of the device. The device comprises an axis layout in which expansion and contraction mechanisms disposed on the right and left are connected to a seat at a single point, a device layout in which the device is disposed along the inner side of the user's legs, and a mechanism that utilizes a circular arc-shaped rail. With these original layouts and mechanisms, we achieved a walking assist device that can be put on and taken off easily without the need to fasten the device to a user's body, and that can always maintain the assist force vector in the direction from the center of pressure of floor reaction force to the center of gravity of the user's body by using only two actuators. The device can reduce the load on leg muscles and joints in various movements and postures. It was confirmed that the device has an assist effect of reducing the user's leg muscle activities as well as the user's total body energy consumption when the user climbs stairs or performs a squat exercise.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to show what image prediction can bring to image-based visual servoing. The visual feature prediction is obtained thanks to the interaction matrix. Based on a model predictive control strategy, the visual servoing task is formulated into an optimization problem. The error between the reference features and the predicted features is to be minimized over a receding prediction horizon. Numerous simulations highlight the interest of prediction, especially for difficult configurations such as large motion and rotation.",

        "abstract": "There are many kinds of large, heavy objects, or objects with geometrical constraints in our daily life, but non-fixed robots such as humanoid robots are still not able to manipulate them sufficiently well. In this paper we focus on a swing door as a heavy object with geometrical constraints, and present a method for the humanoid robots to open it by using impulsive forces. We first discuss on momentum transfer from the robot to the door. Then we propose a method of generating a whole body motion to impact on the door. We analyze the dynamic model of the door, and we confirm the validity of our method through simulation. At last, we realize a motion of the robot opening a swing door quickly by the method in experiment with the HRP-2 robot hardware.",

        "abstract": "Future retinal therapies will be partially automated in order to increase the surgeons' ability to operate near the sensitive structure of the human eye retina. Untethered robotic devices that achieve the desired precision have been proposed, but require localization information for their control. Since the interior of the human eye is externally observable, vision can be used for localization. Previously, a focus-based paraxial localization algorithm using a mechatronic vitreoretinal ophthalmoscope(MVO) was proposed and evaluated by the authors. In this paper, the first algorithm for wide-angle intraocular localization is presented. The effectiveness of this new localization approach is demonstrated by experiments using a model eye and a customized MVO, and there is clear improvement over previously reported results.",

In this paper, a white board works as a diffuse planar light source projecting structured light patterns because physical properties of specular surface do not allow us to directly apply the triangulation-based techniques used in ordinary diffuse surface inspection. The board is placed at two different positions and the distorted structured light patterns are observed by a fixed camera so that the incident vector for every point on the windshield surface is determined using corresponding points in the board at two different positions. Likewise, the reflection vector is determined by camera calibration. Hence, the 3D shape and normal of the windshield surface are obtained by the intersection of the incident and reflection vectors. The normal of the surface denotes the optical reflective property of the windshield. Last, accuracy and consistence experiments are conducted. The experiment results demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our system.",

        "abstract": "To fulfill the dream of having autonomous robots at home, there is a need for spatial representations augmented with semantic concepts. Vision has emerged recently as the key modality to recognize semantic categories like places (office, corridor, kitchen, etc). A crucial aspect of these semantic place representations is that they change over time, due to the dynamism of the world. This calls for visual algorithms able to learn from experience while at the same time managing the continuous flow of incoming data. This paper addresses these issues by presenting an SVM-based algorithm able to (a) learn continuously from experience with a fast updating rule, and (b) control the memory growth via a random forgetting mechanism while at the same time preserving an accuracy comparable to that of the batch algorithm. We apply our method to two different scenarios where learning from experience plays an important role: (1) continuous learning of visual places under dynamic changes, and (2) knowledge transfer of visual concepts across robot platforms. For both scenarios, results confirm the effectiveness of our approach.",

This algorithm, named Incremental Adaptive Random Walks (iARW), uses a modified version of the ARW algorithm proposed by Carpin and Pillonetto for exploring the configuration space and storing the discovered path in a roadmap. Thus, the main idea is to use bidirectional adaptive random walks to explore the configuration space but also to use and expand the roadmap whenever possible.With this approach it is possible to construct a roadmap that captures the connectivity of the free configuration space without a preprocessing phase. A comparison of our approach with other state of the art path planners illustrates the good performance of the proposed method.",
