The work draws inspiration from well established methodologies in object tracking and segmentation. The main contribution is how the polar representation is exploited for tracking, including enabling parallelization for sub millisecond performance. The presented results show the feasibility of the method in a wide range of settings.",

The actuator is composed of two plastic films, a stator film and a slider film. The two films are sectioned into four-by-four checkerboard patterns, whose squares include fine-pitched strip electrodes arranged in orthogonal directions. A pair of three-phase voltages drives the slider in open-loop, along any preset paths in the 2-D plane. A prototype was fabricated with etched indium tin oxides and screenprinted conductive polymers. With 500 V excitation, the prototype exerted 60 to 100 mN forces in eight directions, and the slider traveled along straight and circular paths within its operating range of 132 mm by 132 mm, at maximum speed of 240 mm/s. With the transparency, the actuator realizes collaboration of an actuated physical object and animated images, on surfaces of flat panel displays.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new method to estimate the 3D motion of a vehicle based on car-like structured motion model using an omnidirectional camera and a laser rangefinder. In recent years, motion estimation using vision sensor has improved by assuming planar motion in most conventional research to reduce requirement parameters and computational cost. However, for real applications in environment of outdoor terrain, the motion does not satisfy this condition. In contrast, our proposed method uses one corresponding image point and motion orientation to estimate the vehicle motion in 3D. In order to reduce requirement parameters for speedup computational systems, the vehicle moves under car-like structured motion model assumption. The system consists of a camera and a laser rangefinder mounted on the vehicle. The laser rangefinder is used to estimate motion orientation and absolute translation of the vehicle. An omnidirectional image-based one-point correspondence is used for combining with motion orientation and absolute translation to estimate rotation components of yaw, pitch angles and three translation components of Tx, Ty, and Tz. Real experiments in sloping terrain demonstrate the accuracy of vehicle localization estimation using the proposed method. The error at the end of travel position of our method, one-point RANSAC are 1.1%, 5.1%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Rows of trees such as in orchards, planted in straight parallel lines can provide navigation cues for autonomous machines that operate in between them. When the tree canopies are well managed, tree rows appear similar to corridor walls and a simple 2D sensing scheme suffices. However, when the tree canopies are three dimensional, or ground vegetation occludes tree trunks, it is necessary to use a three dimensional sensing mode. An additional complication in prolific canopies is that GPS is not reliable and hence is not suitable to register data from sensors onboard a traversing vehicle. Here, we present a method to register 3D data from a lidar sensor onboard a vehicle that must accurately determine its pose relative to the rows. We first register point cloud into a common reference frame and then determine the position of tree rows and trunks in the vicinity to determine the vehicle pose. Our method is tested online and with data from commercial orchards. Experimental results show that the accuracy is sufficient to enable accurate traversal between tree rows even when tree canopies do not approximate planar walls.",

Our approach only requires two consecutive images with a minimum of three feature matches. It does not require any (point) map nor any type of feature history. Thus it is an inherently failsafe approach that is immune to map and feature-track failures. With these minimal requirements we show in real experiments that the system is able to navigate drift free in all angles including yaw, in one metric position axis, and in 3D metric velocity. Furthermore, it is a power-on-and-go system able to online self-calibrate the inertial biases, the visual scale and the full 6DoF extrinsic transformation parameters between camera and IMU.",

Performance of point cloud registration between target and source clouds is effectively improved by introducing maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. The standard Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm for the registration sometimes falls into misalignment due to measurement errors, narrow sensing field of view, or the movement of objects during measurement. Our approach resolves such problems by considering both the likelihood of the measurement and the prior probability of the initial guess for registration in the objective function. We have implemented a new 6DOF Iterative Closest Point matching using MAP estimation, and evaluated the method in real environments comparing with conventional registration methods. The experimental results have shown that our proposed method has wide convergence region and matches point clouds accurately preventing the misalignment problem.",

The algorithm can be used for relative pose estimation of a rigid body equipped with a camera and a relative rotation angle sensor which can be either an odometer, an IMU or a GPS/INS system. This algorithm exploits the fact that the relative rotation angles of both the camera and relative rotation angle sensor are the same as the camera and sensor are rigidly mounted to a rigid body. Therefore, knowledge of the extrinsic calibration between the camera and sensor is not required. We carry out a quantitative comparison of our algorithm with the well-known 5-point and 1-point algorithms, and show that our algorithm exhibits the highest level of accuracy.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel CPG-based control architecture for hexapod walking robot. We investigate the CPG systems from the perspective of network synchronization. In this way the motion control of hexapod robot can be refined into the gait generation level and joints coordination level. On the first level, we develop a gait generator consists of CPG network in ring based on modified Van der Pol (VDP) oscillator to realize various stable gaits as well as gait transition for hexapod walking. The limit cycle behavior of VDP model is analytically studied by virtue of perturbation technique. On the second level, we address the problem of multi-DoF coordination of single leg via phase order modulation and amplitude adjustment of the neural oscillators. Consequently we propose a single-leg controller consists of a three-coupled CPG network and a linear coefficient converter to generator smooth and feasible trajectories in task space. The effectiveness of the proposed control architecture is demonstrated through simulation and real physical robot experiment.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Graphical models jointly with non linear optimization have become the most popular approaches for solving SLAM and Bundle Adjustment problems: using a non linear least squares (NLSQs) description of the problem, these math tools serve to formalize the minimization of an error cost function that relates state variables through relative sensor observations. The simplest case just considers as state variables the locations of the sensor/robot in the environment deriving in a pose graph subproblem. In general, the cost function is based on the L2 norm whose principal iterative solutions exploit the sparse connectivity of the corresponding Gaussian Markov Field (GMRF) or the Factor Graph, whose adjacency matrices are given by the fill-in of the Hessian and Jacobian of the cost function respectively. In this paper we propose a novel solution based on the L1 norm as a back-end to the pose graph subproblem. In contrast to other NLSQs approaches, we formulate an iterative algorithm inspired directly on the Factor Graph structure to solve for the linearized residual \u2225Ax - b\u22251. Under the presence of spurious measurements the L1 based solution can achieve similar results to the robust Huber norm. Indeed, our main interest in L1 optimization is that it opens the door to the set of more robust non-convex Lp norms where p \u2264 1. Since our approach depends on the minimization of a non differentiable function, we provide the theoretical insights to solve for the L1 norm. Our optimization is based on a primal-dual formulation successfully applied for solving variational convex problems in computer vision. We show the effectiveness of the L1 norm to produce both a robust initial seed and a final optimized solution on challenging and well known datasets widely used in other state of the art works.",

Since any system with two inputs and up to four generalized coordinates can always be transformed into chained form, this path planning problem can be solved using well-established procedures. Nevertheless, the use of these procedures requires a good understanding of Lie algebraic methods whose technicalities have proven a challenge to many practitioners who are not familiar with them. As an alternative, we show how by (a) properly locating the actuators, and (b) representing the platform orientation using Euler parameters, the studied path planning problem admits a closed-form solution whose derivation requires no other tools than ordinary linear algebra.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Suturing is an important yet time-consuming part of surgery. A fast and robust autonomous procedure could reduce surgeon fatigue, and shorten operation times. It could also be of particular importance for suturing in remote tele-surgery settings where latency can complicate the master-slave mode control that is the current practice for robotic surgery with systems like the da Vinci\u00ae. We study the applicability of the trajectory transfer algorithm proposed in [12] to the automation of suturing. The core idea of this procedure is to first use non-rigid registration to find a 3D warping function which maps the demonstration scene onto the test scene, then use this warping function to transform the robot end-effector trajectory. Finally a robot joint trajectory is generated by solving a trajectory optimization problem that attempts to find the closest feasible trajectory, accounting for external constraints, such as joint limits and obstacles. Our experiments investigate generalization from a single demonstration to differing initial conditions. A first set of experiments considers the problem of having a simulated Raven II system [5] suture two flaps of tissue together. A second set of experiments considers a PR2 robot performing sutures in a scaled-up experimental setup. The simulation experiments were fully autonomous. For the real-world experiments we provided human input to assist with the detection of landmarks to be fed into the registration algorithm. The success rate for learning from a single demonstration is high for moderate perturbations from the demonstration's initial conditions, and it gradually decreases for larger perturbations.",

When sensor nodes (e.g., robots) communicate only a quantized version of their analog measurements to the team, our proposed hybrid filters enable robots to process all available information, i.e., local analog measurements (recorded by its own sensors) as well as remote quantized measurements (collected and communicated by other sensors). Moreover, these filters are resource-aware and can utilize additional bandwidth, whenever available, to maximize estimation accuracy. Specifically, in this paper, we present two filters, the Hybrid Batch-Quantized Kalman filter (H-BQKF) and the Hybrid Iteratively-Quantized Kalman filter (H-IQKF), that can process local analog measurements along with remote measurements quantized to any number of bits. We test our proposed filters in simulations and experimentally, and demonstrate that they achieve performance comparable to the standard Kalman filter.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "For the purpose of autonomous UAV flight control, cameras are ubiquitously exploited as a cheap and effective onboard sensor for obtaining non-metric position or velocity measurements. Since the metric scale cannot be directly recovered from visual input only, several methods have been proposed in the recent literature to overcome this limitation by exploiting independent `metric' information from additional onboard sensors. The flexibility of most approaches is, however, often limited by the need of constantly tracking over time a certain set of features in the environment, thus potentially suffering from possible occlusions or loss of tracking during flight. In this respect, in this paper we address the problem of estimating the scale of the observed linear velocity in the UAV body frame from direct measurement of the instantaneous (and non-metric) optical flow, and the integration of an onboard Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for providing (metric) acceleration readings. To this end, two different estimation techniques are developed and critically compared: a standard Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a novel nonlinear observer stemming from the adaptive control literature. Results based on simulated and real data recorded during a quadrotor UAV flight demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.",

Given the challenging task of controlling compliant bipedal systems, owing to their possession of underactuated degrees of freedom, the full actuator and link dynamics are accounted for. The proposed walking strategy involves a process of switching between three distinct controllers which is contingent upon the force feedback provided by the force/torque sensors embedded in the robot's feet. These controllers were tuned using a simulation model of the robot and were then implemented on the compliant COMAN legs, whose performance of walking confirms the controllers' stability, in addition to the walking scheme's efficacy.",

These trajectories are from arbitrary initial states to final states defined by the vehicle position, velocity and acceleration with a specified end of time. Sufficient criteria are then derived allowing trajectories to be tested for feasibility with respect to thrust and body rates. It is also shown that the range of a linear combination of the vehicle state can be solved for in closed form, useful e.g. for testing that the position remains within a box. The algorithm is applied by revisiting the problem of finding a trajectory to hit a ball towards a target with a racket attached to a quadrocopter. The trajectory generator is used in a model predictive control like strategy, where thousands of trajectories are generated and evaluated at every controller update step, with the first input of the optimal trajectory being sent to the vehicle. It is shown that the method can generate and evaluate on the order of one million trajectories per second on a standard laptop computer.",

Robot working environments will be increasingly unstructured, as safety barriers will be removed to allow a continuous cooperation of robotic and human workers. Such a working scenario calls for novel safety systems capable of combining productivity with workers' safety. In this paper, a method for the definition of a task-consistent collision avoidance safety strategy is presented. A classification of task constraints based on relevance for task completion is introduced. Control of task constraints enforcement is performed through a state machine. A template for such state machine is proposed. Experimental validation of the proposed safety system on a dual-arm industrial robot prototype is presented.",

        "abstract": "Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) involves two main procedures, performed in different rooms on different days: (1) treatment planning in the simulator room on the first day, and (2) radiotherapy in the linear accelerator room over multiple subsequent days. Both the simulator and the linear accelerator include CT imaging capabilities, which enables both treatment planning and reproducible patient setup, but does not provide good soft tissue contrast or allow monitoring of the target during treatment. We propose a cooperatively-controlled robot to reproducibly position an ultrasound (US) probe on the patient during simulation and treatment, thereby improving soft tissue visualization and allowing real-time monitoring of the target. A key goal of the robotic system is to produce consistent tissue deformations for both CT and US imaging, which simplifies registration of these two modalities. This paper presents the robotic system design and describes a novel control algorithm that employs virtual springs to implement guidance virtual fixtures during \u201chands on\u201d cooperative control.",

The main contribution consists of a kinematic model of the human hand reconstructed via magnetic resonance imaging of one subject that (i) is fully parameterized and can be adapted to different subjects, and (ii) is amenable to in-vivo joint angle recordings via optical tracking of markers attached to the skin. The principal novelty here is the introduction of a soft-tissue artifact compensation mechanism that can be optimally calibrated in a systematic way. The high-quality data gathered are employed to study the properties of hand postural synergies in humans, for the sake of ongoing neuroscience investigations. These data are analyzed and some comparisons with similar studies are reported. After a meaningful mapping strategy has been devised, these data could be employed to define robotic hand postures suitable to attain effective grasps, or could be used as prior knowledge in lower-dimensional, real-time avatar hand animation.",

        "abstract": "In this paper a fabric yielding softness display (FYD-2) is proposed, where the stretching state is controlled using two motors, while the contact area is measured in real-time. In previous works, authors proposed a fabric-based device, with embedded contact area measurement system, which was proved to provide subjects with a compelling and naturalistic softness perception. Compared to it, FYD-2 exhibits reduced dimensions, a more accurate sensorization scheme and an increased actuation velocity, which allows to implement fast changes in the stretching state levels. These changes are mandatory, for example, to properly track typical quadratic force/area curves of real materials. Furthermore, FYD-2 is endowed with an additional degree of freedom that can be used to convey supplementary haptic cues, such as directional cues, which can be exploited to produce more immersive haptic interactions. In this work we describe the mechanical design and the mathematical model of the device. The reliability in real-time tracking of stiffness and force-area curves of real objects is also demonstrated.",

External torques on the haptic device links are observed to distinguish between intended user interaction and accidental collisions of the links. Collisions can be unintentional contact of the human operator, e.g. with his knee, other people accidentally getting in contact with the haptic device or objects falling on it. The observer is based on the dynamic model of the device and sensor measurements from the joint's position sensors and an integrated force/torque sensor. Is is implemented concurrently with a control algorithm that uses the force/torque sensor to effectively reduce the inertia and friction of the sigma.7. Furthermore, forces and torques applied on the grasping unit by the human operator are observed.

        "abstract": "Toward the goal of developing a hands-on robotic surgery control strategy which simultaneously utilizes the various strengths of both the surgeon and robot, we present a dynamic active constraint approach tailored for hands-on surgery. Forbidden region active constraints are used to prevent motion into areas which have been deemed dangerous by the surgeon, helping to overcome some of the disadvantages of fully active systems such as loss of tactile feedback, limited workspace, and limited field-of-view. The computer graphics technique of metaballs is used to represent point cloud data from an imaging system with an analytical, differentiable surface and a dynamics-based controller is proposed which controls the robot to lie on the zero set of the generated time-varying implicit function for which the motion is either known or unknown. This controller has been incorporated into a recursive null-space approach to allow for unimpeded motion along the surface and for further extension to joint optimization in the future. This methodology is demonstrated in simulation and on a lightweight, seven-degree-of-freedom serial manipulator.",

The challenge arises from the non-holonomic characteristics of the car and the close distance to the obstacles. The presented approach utilizes the Minkowski sum to account for obstacle avoidance. The geometric path planning problem is decoupled from the kinematic problem and discretized with respect to the path parameter by means of a Runge-Kutta discretization. For the discrete path segments, an optimization problem is formulated to calculate the path independent of the parking scenario. This static optimization problem can be solved numerically in a very efficient way. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated in several simulation scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Sampling-based probabilistic roadmap algorithms such as PRM and PRM* have been shown to be effective at solving certain motion planning problems, but the large graphs generated to express the connectivity and a metric on the configuration space may require much storage space and be expensive to search. Recent work by Marble and Bekris [14], [19] applied spanner algorithms to PRM* these algorithms prune some edges in a dense graph, while guaranteeably maintaining an approximation to the metric. In this paper, we apply (and improve) a state-of-the-art streaming spanner algorithm to prune PRM* roadmaps. The algorithm we present has the main advantage of computational speed; when applied to PRM*, the processing time per vertex is independent of the number of sampled vertices, n, as compared to O(nlog2 nloglogn) in [19]. In practice, the algorithm we present prunes a graph with about 20 million edges in less than 20 seconds on a modern desktop computer; compared to the time required for generating such a roadmap, this additional processing time is essentially trivial. In fact, because the combination of this algorithm with PRM* avoids the need for many collision detections, the combination runs several times faster than PRM*alone.",

        "abstract": "In this work we address the inverse kinetics problem of a non-constant curvature manipulator driven by three cables. An exact geometrical model of this manipulator has been employed. The differential equations of the mechanical model are non-linear, therefore the analytical solutions are difficult to calculate. Since the exact solutions of the mechanical model are not available, the elements of the Jacobian matrix can not be calculated. To overcome intrinsic problems of the methods based on the Jacobian matrix, we propose for the first time a neural network learning the inverse kinetics of the soft manipulator moving in three-dimensional space. After the training, a feed-forward neural network (FNN) is able to represent the relation between the manipulator tip position and the forces applied to the cables. The results show that a desired tip position can be achieved with a degree of accuracy of 1.36% relative average error with respect to the total arm length.",

Here we introduce the concept and the design of a flying robot with Adaptive Morphology for Multi-Modal Locomotion. We present a prototype that can use its wings to walk on the ground and fly forward. The wings are used as whegs to move on rough terrains. This solution allows to minimize the structural mass of the robot by reusing the same structure (here the wings) for different modes of locomotion. Furthermore, the morphology of the robot is analysed and optimized for ground speed.",

Due to the use of simplifed models in the design of feedback control algorithms, the execution of highperformance fight maneuvers under pure feedback control typically leads to large tracking errors. This paper investigates an iterative learning scheme aimed at the non-causal compensation of repeatable trajectory tracking errors over the course of multiple executions of periodic maneuvers. The learning is carried out in the frequency domain and uses a simplifed model of the closed-loop dynamics of quadrocopter and feedback controller. The resulting algorithm requires little computational power and memory, and its convergence is shown for the nominal model. This paper further introduces a time-scaling method that allows the initial learning to occur at reduced speeds, thus extending the applicability of the algorithm for high performance maneuvers. The presented algorithms are validated in experiments, with a quadrocopter fying a fgure-eight maneuver at high speed.",

The postural coordination task investigated is related to an experimental paradigm that consists in visual target tracking task while balancing. We want to test whether the human biomechanical responses, namely phase / antiphase coordination mode transition, as exhibited during the actual experiments can be modeled by a linearized double inverted pendulum and parallel independent PD feedback control loops. Remarkably, these loops implement joint space control using cartesian task space variables. Furthermore, we want to see how the feedback control gains given by an optimization procedure scale w.r.t frequency or target motion magnitude. A closed-loop synthesis is developed that consists in minimizing a minimum torque criterion under both balance and task constraints. We show that the optimal feedback control gains obtained yield model responses consistent with the literature. In a second part, we implement a gain-scheduling approach where control gains values are predicted via interpolation. Finally, our approach implements a controller capable of achieving the task even when the frequency of the target motion varies over time.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a tactile approach to grasp large and unknown objects, which can not be easily manipulated with a single end-effector or two-handed grasps, with the whole upper body of a humanoid robot. Instead of conventional joint level force sensing, we equip the robot with various patches of HEX-o-SKIN \u2014 a self-organizing, multi-modal cellular artificial skin. Low-level controllers, one allocated to each sensor cell, utilize a self-explored inverted jacobian-like sensory-motor map to directly transfer tactile stimulation into reactive arm motions, altering basic grasping trajectories to the need of the current object. A high-level state machine guides those low-level controllers during the different states of the grasping action. Desired contact points, and key poses for the trajectory generation, are taught through forceless tactile stimulation. First experiments on a position controlled robot, an HRP-2 humanoid, demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Our paper contributes to the first realization of a self-organizing tactile sensor-behavior mapping on a full-sized humanoid robot, which enables: 1) a new general approach for grasping unknown objects with the whole-body; and 2) a novel way of teaching behaviors using pre-contact tactile sensing.",

In the studied problem, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with sonar surveys the bottom of the ocean searching for mines. We use a cellular decomposition to represent the ocean floor by a grid of uniform square cells. The robot scans a fixed number of cells sideways with a varying probability of detection as a function of distance and of seabed type. The goal is to plan a path that achieves the minimal required coverage in each cell while minimizing the total traveled distance and the total number of turns. We propose an off-line hybrid algorithm based on dynamic programming and on a traveling salesman problem reduction. We present experimental results and show that our algorithm's performance is superior to published results in terms of path quality and computational time, which makes it possible to implement the algorithm in an AUV.",

        "abstract": "The design and the fabrication of a mesoscale jumping robotic insect are presented. The basis of the robot is a torque reversal catapult mechanism, inspired by a flea's jumping leg. The current robot structure is 20mm in length, 2mm in height and weighs 34mg. The smart composite microstructures (SCM) process is used to developing the mesoscale structures and articulated, flexure-based mechanisms of the leg. Furthermore, the design is compatible with the pop-up book MEMS process, ameliorating the laborious assembly process of small components. The robot prototype can achieve jumps of approximately 30cm with a 2.7m/s initial velocity. It is 150 times its body height. The effect of air resistance is considered in order to improve jumping performance with the light weight body structure. The air resistance efficiency (Jumping height in air (hv) / Jumping height in vacuum (hv)) is computed to be 0.83 and the robot exhibits a drag coefficient of 1.8.",

Like other artificial audition tasks, it is constrained to multiple problems, notably sound reflections and noises. This paper presents a sound source azimuth estimation approach in reverberant environments. It exploits binaural signals in a humanoid robotic context. Interaural Time and Level Differences (ITD and ILD) are extracted on multiple frequency bands and combined with a neural network-based learning scheme. A cue filtering process is used to reduce the reverberations effects. The system has been evaluated with simulation and real data, in multiple aspects covering realistic robot operating conditions, and was proven satisfying and effective as will be shown and discussed in the paper.",

Starting from works in the neuroscience field on human hand postural synergies, we introduce a two-level algorithm that uses a mathematical model of relationships between muscles and degrees-of-freedom of the hand and a set of five parameters to define synergies between muscles according to some grasp properties taken from an existing taxonomy of grasps. The two-level architecture presented in this paper aims to provide the flexibility needed for working with a real robotic hand. This algorithm is validated both in simulation using Gazebo and on the Shadow Robot Hand.",

These modules, when connected, form a hexapod with two degrees of freedom per leg. All custom mechanical parts are manufactured in a planar fashion using a laser cutter. We created this print-and-fold hexapod as a miniature version of a commercially available platform, to which we compare several metrics, such as weight, walking speed, and cost of transportation. Our print-and-fold hexapod has a mass of 195 g, can walk at speeds of up to 38.1 cm/sec (two body lengths per second), and can be manufactured and assembled from scratch by a single person in approximately seven hours. Experimental results of gait control and trajectory tracking are provided.",

A new method is proposed to describe the shoulder kinematics with minimal coordinates and solve the indeterminacy. The minimal coordinates are defined from bony landmarks and the scapulothoracic kinematic constraints. Independent from one another, they uniquely characterise the shoulder motion. A humanoid mechanism is then proposed with identical kinematic properties. It is then shown how minimal coordinates can be obtained for this mechanism and how the coordinates simplify both the motion-planning task and trajectory-tracking control. Lastly, the coordinates are also shown to have an application in the field of biomechanics where they can be used to model the scapulohumeral rhythm.",

However, in the case of rigid impacts, as they can occur during hitting or running, the system behavior is changed compared to free motions which turns the control into a challenging task. We introduce a controller that excites periodic motions along the direction of an intrinsic mechanical oscillation mode. The controller requires no model knowledge and adapts to a modal excitation by means of measurement of the states. We experimentally show that the controller is able to stabilize a hitting motion on the variable stiffness robot DLR Hand Arm System. Further, we demonstrate by simulation that the approach applies for legged robotic systems with compliantly actuated joints. The controlled system can approach different modes of motion such as jumping, hopping and running, and thereby, it is able to handle the repeated occurrence of robot-ground contacts.",

We argue that software deployment decisions should be separated as much as possible from the core development of software functionalities. This will make the developed software more independent of a particular hardware architecture (and thus more reusable) and allow it to be deployed more flexibly on a wider variety of robot platforms. This paper presents a domain-specific language (DSL) which supports this idea and demonstrates how the DSL is used in a model-driven engineering-based development process.

The controller makes use of a virtual mass, coupled to the robotic system, which allows for stable interaction. The focus is mainly on unmanned aerial vehicles that are required to get into contact with the environment to perform a specific task on it and that can be shifted by humans. The control architecture is validated both in simulations, on a 1-dimensional benchmark, and in experiments on a real quadrotor flying vehicle.",

A motor mounted on one link of a parallelogram four-bar linkage directly drives the opposite link via a cable, gear, or friction drive. Any of the four links can be used as the base or output link, depending on whether relatively high force translational motion, relatively high motion range translational motion, or rotational motion is desired. Appropriately combining multiple modules yields devices that can provide planar or spatial translational motions. Concept designs that combine multiple Arctuator modules depict how the modules can be used for manipulation, fabrication, locomotion, and other applications. Experimental results demonstrate that a prototype Arctuator module is capable of accelerating a cantilevered load of double its own mass upward at 1 g.",

For this class of aircraft, the distinguishing feature of the proposed design - which sets it apart from standard vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) underactuated configurations such as helicopters, ducted-fan tail-sitters or multi-rotors - is that the input redundancy can be employed to improve the dynamical properties of the system. In particular, the vehicle performance can be enhanced in certain applications that benefit from a larger number of degrees of freedom being simultaneously controlled. A control strategy is proposed which is capable of globally stabilizing the dynamics of this class of vehicles along a desired trajectory. The methodology is validated by means of experiments carried out on a special prototype obtained by rigidly connecting two ducted-fan tail-sitter UAVs.",

In contrast to existing calibration patterns, in particular, the ubiquitous chessboard, the proposed pattern contains many more features of varying scales; such features can be easily and automatically detected. The proposed toolbox supports the calibration of a camera system which can comprise either normal pinhole cameras or catadioptric cameras. The calibration only requires that neighboring cameras observe parts of the calibration pattern at the same time; the observed parts may not overlap at all. No overlapping fields of view are assumed for the camera system. We show that the toolbox can easily be used to automatically calibrate camera systems.",

        "abstract": "It is well recognized that many scientifically interesting sites on Mars are located in rough terrains. Therefore, to enable safe autonomous operation of a planetary rover during exploration, the ability to accurately estimate terrain traversability is critical. In particular, this estimate needs to account for terrain deformation, which significantly affects the vehicle attitude and configuration. This paper presents an approach to estimate vehicle configuration, as a measure of traversability, in deformable terrain by learning the correlation between exteroceptive and proprioceptive information in experiments. We first perform traversability estimation with rigid terrain assumptions, then correlate the output with experienced vehicle configuration and terrain deformation using a multi-task Gaussian Process (GP) framework. Experimental validation of the proposed approach was performed on a prototype planetary rover and the vehicle attitude and configuration estimate was compared with state-of-the-art techniques. We demonstrate the ability of the approach to accurately estimate traversability with uncertainty in deformable terrain.",

        "abstract": "A novel robotic device, aimed at assisting a urologist in performing prostate biopsies guided by an endorectal ultrasound probe, is described. The paper describes the robot kinematics and the actuation system. The actuation system combines electromagnetic brakes, balancing springs, and electrical motors with cable transmissions. The robot supports two modes of operation: the free mode, where the entire control of the probe movements is left to the urologist, and the blocked mode, where the robot precisely maintains the probe at a given position and orientation with respect to the prostate. For the blocked mode, the set of specifications is antagonistic: firstly, a security constraint requires a low robot stiffness to allow to compliantly adapt to potential movements from the patient; secondly, a precision constraint requires a high robot stiffness in order to maintain the position and orientation of the probe in the presence of unmodeled external forces, when the robot is switched from the free mode to the blocked mode. A control strategy is developed to obtain this behavior. It combines an inner impedance controller with a relatively low stiffness and an outer intelligent position integrator that operates only during a limited period of time, when switching from the free mode to the blocked mode. Both in vitro and in cadavero experimental results show the efficiency of this approach.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, robotic bio-manipulation emerges as a hot research topic in the micro/nano technology. In these applications, biological cell microinjection is a focus since it is a critical process for the further biological research such as genetic engineering and pharmacology research. This study aims to develop a novel robotic biomanipulation system combining with the micro-fluidic chip technology to improve the cell manipulation stability and throughput. Two novel flexure-based large-workspace micromanipulators with modified differential lever displacement amplifier (MDLDA) are presented in this paper. After a series of optimal designs and mechanism modeling, the mechanism performances are evaluated by the FEA method. Finally, the proposed micromanipulators are fabricated and visual-servo controlled to perform the practical zebrafish embryos injection task. In this work, two piezoelectric (PZT) actuators P-216.80 (open-loop travel is 120 \u03bcm) and one PZT actuator P-840.20 (open-loop travel is 30 \u03bcm) are utilized in the compliant mechanisms, the experiment results indicate that the displacement amplification ratios can reach up to 30.6 and 17.6, thus the maximum output displacements can achieve around 3.1273 mm and 0.528 mm, the rotation angle of the left micromanipulator can reach to around 26.5\u00b0. Both theoretical derivation and experimental implementation results well verify the advanced performance of the developed system.",

        "abstract": "Hand posture is a natural and effective human robot interaction way. In this paper, an user-independent hand posture recognition system using depth and color images captured from an RGB-D camera is presented. To recognize hand posture against complicated background conditions, we propose a novel method for automatic and accurate hand posture segmentation which detects the hand with Chamfer matching, tracks the hand with Kalman filter and segments the hand with region growing algorithm only in the depth space. A new hand posture descriptor invariant to scale, shift and in-plane rotation is constructed with the combination of local contour Fourier descriptor and global Bag-of-Features (BoF) descriptor based on Scale Invariance Feature Transform (SIFT). The sparse representation-based classification (SRC) is applied to perform the hand posture recognition task in the system. Experiments with a self-built large scale hand posture database collected online show the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed system.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is a recently developed revolutionary medical technology which records the video of human's digestive tract noninvasively. However, reviewing a WCE video is a tired and time-consuming task for clinicians. Thus, WCE video automatic segmentation methods are emerging to reduce the review time for clinicians. In our previous work, a two-level WCE video segmentation approach has been proposed, which provides a novel approach to localize the boundaries more exactly and efficiently. However, it has an unsatisfactory performance in the small intestine/large intestine boundary detection. In this paper, we propose new features and an improved classifier to improve the previous two-level segmentation algorithm. In the rough level, color feature is utilized to draw a dissimilarity curve and an approximate boundary has been obtained. At the same time, training data for fine level can be directly labeled and collected between the two approximate boundaries of organs to overcome the difficulty of training data acquisition. In the fine level, a novel color uniform local binary pattern (CULBP) algorithm is proposed, which includes two kinds of patterns, color norm patterns and color angle patterns. The CULBP feature is more robust to variation of illumination and more discriminative for classification. Moreover, in order to elevate the performance of SVM classifier we proposed the Ada-SVM classifier which using RBFSVMs as component of Adaboost classifier. At last, an analysis of classification results of the Ada-SVM classifier is carried out to segment the WCE video into several meaningful parts, stomach, small intestine and large intestine. The experiments demonstrate a promising performance of the proposed method. The average precision and recall are as high as 91.37% and 88.50% in stomach/small intestine classification, 90.35% and 97.28% in small intestine/ large intestine classification.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Mobile robots with independently steerable wheels possess many high maneuverability features of omnidirectional robots while benefiting from better performance and capability of moving on rough terrains. However, motion control of such robots is a challenging task due to presence of singular configurations and unboundedly large steering velocities in the neighborhood of those singularities. Many proposed approaches rely on numerical solutions that keep the robot out of bulky regions around the singular points and hence lose some of the robot maneuverability. Based on a class of traditional path followers we design a new globally stable path following controller that exploits the high maneuverability of the platform. This design allows us to derive a set of closed-form analytical functions that describe the robot base velocity as a function of the wheels driving and steering velocities while abide to the robot non-holonomic constraints. Those functions are then utilized to find the maximum instantaneous velocity of the body that keeps the wheels velocities under the pre-specified bounds no matter how much the robot gets close or far from its singular configurations. The control algorithms developed in this paper have been evaluated on iMoro, a four wheel independently steered mobile manipulator designed and developed at IHA/TUT. Experimental data is also shown that show efficacy of the method.",

The propulsor (tail) of the robot has an underactuated serpentine backbone and the actuation is done by two sets of orthogonally distributed wires. The backbone is composed of seven vertebras and an elastic rod. The vertebras are articulated by the rod and spherical joints. The horizontal flapping and vertical flapping are independently actuated by two motors. This enables the propulsor providing thrust in all directions. Propulsion model of the propulsor is developed by integrating the kinematic model and Lighthill's elongated body theory. A prototype is built. Tests show that the robot fish could flap its tail like the shark or the dolphin effectively. In the swimming tests, the maximum swimming speed of the robot is 0.35 BL/s.",

The particles represent (partial) interpretations of possible worlds (with discrete and/or continuous variables) and the filter recursively updates its beliefs about the current state. We use backward reasoning to determine which facts should be included in the partial interpretations.

On one side the mechanical structure and the control was designed looking at the animal, in particular at the coupling between its anatomy and control system that allows the animal to survive in its ecosystem. On the other side engineering issues and constraints were carefully accounted for, namely material softness, intrinsic safety, energy efficiency, cost effectiveness and manufacturing aspects.

        "abstract": "Facial expressions are a rich source of communicative information about human behavior and emotion. This paper presents a real-time system for recognition and imitation of facial expressions in the context of affective Human Robot Interaction. The proposed method achieves a fast and robust facial feature extraction based on consecutively applying filters to the gradient image. An efficient Gabor filter is used, along with a set of morphological and convolutional filters to reduce the noise and the light dependence of the image acquired by the robot. Then, a set of invariant edge-based features are extracted and used as input to a Dynamic Bayesian Network classifier in order to estimate a human emotion. The output of this classifier updates a geometric robotic head model, which is used as a bridge between the human expressiveness and the robotic head. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach compared to similar systems.",

        "abstract": "The presence of roadworks greatly affects the validity of prior maps used for navigation by autonomous vehicles. This paper addresses the problem of quickly and robustly assessing the gist of traffic scenes for whether roadworks might be present. Without explicitly modelling individual roadwork indicators such as traffic cones, construction barriers or traffic signs, our method instead only exploits the engineered visual saliency of such objects. We draw inspiration from opponent colour vision in humans to formulate a novel roadwork scene signature based on an opponent spatial prior combined with gradient information. Finally, we apply our roadwork scene signature to the task of roadwork scene recognition, within a classification framework based on soft assignment vec-torization and RUSBoost. We evaluate our roadwork signature on real life data from our autonomous vehicle.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "It has been long known that fusing information from multiple sensors for robot navigation results in increased robustness and accuracy. However, accurate calibration of the sensor ensemble prior to deployment in the field as well as coping with sensor outages, different measurement rates and delays, render multi-sensor fusion a challenge. As a result, most often, systems do not exploit all the sensor information available in exchange for simplicity. For example, on a mission requiring transition of the robot from indoors to outdoors, it is the norm to ignore the Global Positioning System (GPS) signals which become freely available once outdoors and instead, rely only on sensor feeds (e.g., vision and laser) continuously available throughout the mission. Naturally, this comes at the expense of robustness and accuracy in real deployment. This paper presents a generic framework, dubbed MultiSensor-Fusion Extended Kalman Filter (MSF-EKF), able to process delayed, relative and absolute measurements from a theoretically unlimited number of different sensors and sensor types, while allowing self-calibration of the sensor-suite online. The modularity of MSF-EKF allows seamless handling of additional/lost sensor signals during operation while employing a state buffering scheme augmented with Iterated EKF (IEKF) updates to allow for efficient re-linearization of the prediction to get near optimal linearization points for both absolute and relative state updates. We demonstrate our approach in outdoor navigation experiments using a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) equipped with a GPS receiver as well as visual, inertial, and pressure sensors.",

        "abstract": "In this article we present a sagittal plane, sprawled posture hexapedal running model with distributed body inertia, massless legs and serial elastic actuation at the hips as well as along the telescoping legs. We show by simulation that simple, periodic, feedforward controlled actuation is sufficient to obtain steady period 1 running gaits at twice the actuation frequency. We observe a nearly linear relation of average running speed and actuation frequency. The ground reaction profiles of the legs show leg specialization as observed in running insects. Interleg phasing has a strong influence on the foot fall sequence and thus the overall body dynamics. While the single leg ground reaction force profiles show little dependency on interleg actuation phase the total reaction force does. Thus, depending on the interleg actuation phase body motions without flight phase are observed as well as body motions and total ground reaction forces that show similarities to those obtained for the spring loaded inverted pendulum model. Further, we show that including leg damping and a ground friction model the periodic orbits have a large region of attraction with respect to the initial conditions. Additionally, the model quickly rejects step up and step down disturbances as well as force impulses. Finally, we briefly discuss the energetics of the hexapedal running model.",

        "abstract": "Electrical motors are often used to actuate mechanisms with varying speed and under varying load e.g., missile control actuation systems or robot extremities. Sizing of the motor is critical in these applications where space is limited. Varying speed and load cause poor utilization of the motor if the reduction ratio is constant. This requires employment of a larger motor than the smallest possible with ideal variable transmission. To realize better utilization of the motor, we propose a series elastic actuator that works as a load sensitive continuously variable transmission system. This is achieved by combining a pin in slot mechanism with an elastic output shaft. The proposed mechanism is modeled and simulated using example missile flight data and a typical robot finger loading scenario. Results are compared to the constant reduction ratio case, and advantages of the proposed mechanism are shown as decreased actuator size and power.",

The simulator is then crucial in both the training of the human operator, and as a support tool for the development and validation of low- and high-level control algorithms. The tasks that can be performed are not limited to free-flight missions, but include also to the cases in which the robot has to actively interact with the environment. The simulator relies on Simulink and Blender, and has been designed with a modular structure that makes software-in-the-loop and hardware-in-the-loop simulations possible by simply replacing the different control modules with the real controllers on the prototypes.",

        "abstract": "Numerous snake-like robot mechanisms have been developed over the past several decades. A well studied kinematic structure consists of a series of segments coupled with rotational joints. In some designs, each segment is coupled with a 2-DOF joint. In others, segments are coupled through 1-DOF joints, with even numbered joints implementing yaw and odd numbered joints implementing pitch. In this paper, we present a robotic snake that implements both rotational and translational degrees of freedom in each joint. This new design allows for several new gaits to be implemented. We begin by presenting the mechanical design of the robot, and derive the kinematic equations of the robot's joints. Next, the electrical and communication systems are described. Finally, several gaits unique to this kinematic design are demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a sound localization algorithm inspired by a cross-channel algorithm first studied by MacDonald et. al in 2008. The original algorithm assumes that the Head Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) of the robotic head under study are precisely known, which is rarely the case in practice. Following the idea that any head is more or less spherical, the above assumption is relaxed by using HRTFs computed using a simple spherical head model with the same head radius as the robot head. In order to evaluate the proposed approach in realistic noisy conditions, an isotropic noise field is also computed and a precise definition of the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in a binaural context is outlined. All these theoretical developments are finally assessed with simulated and experimental signals. Despite its simplicity, the proposed approach appears to be robust to noise and to provide reliable sound localization estimations in the frontal azimuthal plane.",

        "abstract": "Replicating human hand capabilities on robotic hands is a great challenge in robotics. The high complexity of mechanical and actuation systems of available robotic device can be, however, considerably mitigated if a human inspired control is considered. In this paper the application of an object-based mapping to the control of robot hands is presented. The basic idea is to use a virtual object, e.g. a virtual sphere, to capture human hand motion generating suitable reference signals for a low level controller of the robotic hand. The low level controller considered, which shares the idea of virtual object to reduce the complexity of the control, is the static Intrinsically Passive Controller (s-IPC). This controller is inspired by the dynamic IPC, but provides a simpler and more efficient implementation. The proposed approach allows to map motion of a human hand model, controlled on the reduced subspace of postural synergies, onto robotic hands guaranteeing the stability of the robotic grasp. This concept, which has been experimentally validated in the paper, can be exploit for complex planning methods or used in telemanipulation application.",

        "abstract": "Sampling-based algorithms have proven practical in solving motion planning challenges in relatively high-dimensional instances in geometrically complex workspaces. Early work focused on quickly returning feasible solutions. Only recently was it shown under which conditions these algorithms asymptotically return optimal or near-optimal solutions. These methods yield desired properties only in an asymptotic fashion, i.e., the properties are attained after infinite computation time. This work studies the finite-time properties of sampling-based planners in terms of path quality. The focus is on roadmap-based methods, due to their simplicity. This work illustrates that existing sampling-based planners which construct roadmaps in an asymptotically (near-)optimal manner exhibit a \u201cprobably near-optimal\u201d property in finite time. This means that it is possible to compute a confidence value, i.e. a probability, regarding the existence of upper bounds for the length of the path returned by the roadmap as a function of the number of configuration space samples. This property can result in useful tools for determining existence of solutions and a probabilistic stopping criterion for PRM-like methods. These properties are validated through experimental trials.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "As researchers are striving for developing robotic systems able to move into the `the wild', the interest towards novel learning paradigms for domain adaptation has increased. In the specific application of semantic place recognition from cameras, supervised learning algorithms are typically adopted. However, once learning has been performed, if the robot is moved to another location, the acquired knowledge may be not useful, as the novel scenario can be very different from the old one. The obvious solution would be to retrain the model updating the robot internal representation of the environment. Unfortunately this procedure involves a very time consuming data-labeling effort at the human side. To avoid these issues, in this paper we propose a novel transfer learning approach for place categorization from visual cues. With our method the robot is able to decide automatically if and how much its internal knowledge is useful in the novel scenario. Differently from previous approaches, we consider the situation where the old and the novel scenario may differ significantly (not only the visual room appearance changes but also different room categories are present). Importantly, our approach does not require labeling from a human operator. We also propose a strategy for improving the performance of the proposed method by fusing two complementary visual cues. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the advantages of our approach on several sequences from publicly available datasets.",

        "abstract": "In the case of human intervention in disaster response operations like indoor firefighting, where the environment perception is limited due to thick smoke, noise in the oxygen masks and clutter, not only limit the environmental perception of the human responders, but also causes distress. An intelligent agent (man/machine) with full environment perceptual capabilities is an alternative to enhance navigation in such unfavorable environments. Since haptic communication is the least affected mode of communication in such cases, we consider human demonstrations to use a hard rein to guide blindfolded followers with auditory distraction to be a good paradigm to extract salient features of guiding using hard reins. Based on numerical simulations and experimental systems identification based on demonstrations from eight pairs of human subjects, we show that, the relationship between the orientation difference between the follower and the guider, and the lateral swing patterns of the hard rein by the guider can be explained by a novel 3rd order auto regressive predictive controller. Moreover, by modeling the two party voluntary movement dynamics using a virtual damped inertial model, we were able to model the mutual trust between two parties. In the future, the novel controller extracted based on human demonstrations can be tested on a human-robot interaction scenario to guide a visually impaired person in various applications like fire fighting, search and rescue, medical surgery, etc.",

Most of this work focuses on low level control of simple hands. Using complex hands improves the versatility of a grasping platform at the cost of increasing its complexity. In order to control more complex hands with these low bandwidth signals, we need to use higher level abstractions. Here, we present a user interface which allows the user to combine the speed and convenience of offline preplanned grasps with the versatility of an online planner. This system incorporates a database of pre-planned grasps with the ability to refine these grasps using an online planner designed for arbitrarily complex hands. Only four commands are necessary to control the entire grasping pipeline, allowing us to use a low cost, noninvasive commercial BCI device to produce robust grasps that reflect user intent. We demonstrate the efficacy of this system with results from five subjects and present results using this system to grasp unknown objects.",

In this paper we present the integration of a robotic system and virtual reality applications for the orthopedic rehabilitation of the arm, in terms of strengthening training and motion recovery. The system simulates the upper limb of the patient and their actions, and allows exhaustive exercising and motor control, giving visuomotor and haptic feedback and trajectory positioning guidance. The system allows assign specific tasks to perform within the virtual environments and aids to evaluate the mobility condition of the patient, to personalize the difficulty level of the therapy and provides kineseologic measures of the patient evolution. We present the results of a preliminary clinical assessment we are carried out on three patients in order to assess the usability and acceptance of the system.",

The originality of this approach is to consider only weak sensor data: the visibility between two robots. The paper demonstrates that with this poor information, without using bearing or range sensors, a localization is possible. By using this boolean information (two robots see each other or not), the objective is to compensate the odometry errors and be able to localize in an indoor environment all the robots of the team, in a guaranteed way. The environment is supposed to be defined by two sets, an inner and an outer characterizations. This paper mainly presents the visibility theory used to develop the method. Simulated results allow to evaluate the efficiency and the limits of the proposed algorithm.",

In this paper we propose and experiment a BMI framework that combines BMI with a robotic house and autonomous robotic wheelchair. Autonomous navigation is achieved by placing waypoints within the house and, from the user side, the user performs BMI to give commands to the house and wheelchair. The waypoint framework can offer essential services to the user with an effectively improved information-transfer rate and is an excellent examples of the fusion of data measured by sensors in the house, which can offer insight into further studies.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a wing characterization method for insect-scale flapping-wing robots. A quasi-steady model is developed to predict passive wing pitching at mid-stroke. Millimeter scale wings and passive hinges are manufactured using the SCM fabrication processes. Flapping experiments at various frequencies and driving voltages are performed to extract kinematics for comparison with the quasi-steady predictions. These experiments examine the validity of the quasi-steady model and demonstrate the robustness of the wing characterization method. In addition, because time-averaged lift and drag are strongly correlated with flapping kinematics, quasi-steady prediction of wing kinematics directly leads to predictions of lift and drag generation. Given a flapping frequency and a driving voltage, the model computes the hinge stiffness that leads to optimal flapping kinematics. This reduces the number of flapping experiments required for wing characterization by a factor of four.",

        "abstract": "It is a challenging problem to achieve fast and realistic six degree-of-freedom (DOF) haptic simulation of scenarios involving large number of multi-region contacts. In this paper, we propose an optimization-based constrained method enhanced by parallel quadratic programming to solve the rendering problem. Hierarchical sphere-tree models are used to represent the moving haptic tool and its surrounding static objects. Given a moving graphic tool as the avatar of the haptic tool in the virtual environment, we compute its quasi-static motion by solving a configuration-based optimization. Instead of using traditional active-set method, we transform the original optimization problem into its dual problem and solve the optimum about the graphic tool using a parallel quadratic programming method. Our algorithm has been implemented with a 6-DoF Phantom Premium 3.0. We validate the proposed algorithm in several benchmarks involving complex, large-region contacts. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a two to three times speed improvement than the active-set method. A further speed-up for haptic rendering may be achieved by the parallel implementation on parallel processor such as graphic processing units.",

This paper studies the accuracy of range-based localization schemes for random sensor networks with respect to network connectivity and scale. We show that the variance of localization errors is proportional to the average geometric dilution of precision (AGDOP). The paper proves a novel lower bound of expectation of AGDOP (LB-E-AGDOP). Our analysis based on LB-E-AGDOP shows that localization accuracy is approximately inversely proportional to the average degree of network. A further analysis shows that when network connectivity merely guarantees localizability, increasing sensor nodes leads to bounded monotonic increase in AGDOP; when a network is densely connected, increasing sensor nodes leads to bounded monotonic decrease in AGDOP. Finally, these conclusions are validated by numerical simulations.",

        "abstract": "Diffeomorphisms dynamical systems are dynamical systems for which the state is an image and each command induce a diffeomorphism of the state. These systems can approximate the dynamics of robotic sensorimotor cascades well enough to be used for problems such as planning in observations space. Learning of an arbitrary diffeomorphism from pairs of images is an extremely high dimensional problem. This paper describes two improvements to the methods presented in previous work. The previous method had required O(\u03c14) memory as a function of the desired resolution \u03c1, which, in practice, was the main limitation to the resolution of the diffeomorphisms that could be learned. This paper describes an algorithm based on recursive refinement that lowers the memory requirement to O(\u03c12). Another improvement regards the estimation the diffeomorphism uncertainty, which is used to represent the sensor's limited field of view; the improved method obtains a more accurate estimation of the uncertainty by checking the consistency of a learned diffeomorphism and its independently learned inverse. The methods are tested on two robotic systems (a pan-tilt camera and a 5-DOF manipulator).",

We present a novel finger pose estimation method using a motion capture system. The method combines system identification and state estimation in a unified framework. The system identification stage investigates the accurate model of a finger, and the state estimation stage tracks the finger pose with the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm based on the model obtained in the system identification stage. The algorithm is validated by simulation and experiment. The experimental results show that the method can robustly estimate the finger pose at a high frequency (greater than 1 Khz) in presence of measurement noise, occlusion of markers, and fast movement.",

We focus on this mechanism and implement it to a musculoskeletal humanoid through hardware design. The importance of developing a knee joint with screw-home mechanism is that such a joint is capable of working yaw-axis properly and generating enough pitch joint torque for supporting whole body motion. In this paper, as an evaluation of our developed knee joint, we first checked the moment arm of the yaw rotational axis of the knee. Moreover, we also checked the yaw angle displacement during squat motion. From these results, we confirmed that the mechanism worked properly. Second, in order to check whether enough pitch joint torque is generated during movement, we conducted several experiments with whole body motions such as squatting. Lastly, as unique and integrated motions that involve the use of yaw DOF derived from the mechanism, we tested knee joint Open-Close, Right-to-Left and whole body twist squat motion. Our results demonstrated the feasibility of musculoskeletal humanoids with screw-home mechanism and showed that we have achieved humanlike twisting motion.",

        "abstract": "When it comes to learning how to manipulate objects from experience with minimal prior knowledge, robots encounter significant challenges. When the objects are unknown to the robot, the lack of prior object models demands a robust feature descriptor such that the robot can reliably compare objects and the effects of their manipulation. In this paper, using an experimental platform that gathers 3-D data from the Kinect RGB-D sensor, as well as push action trajectories from a tracking system, we address these issues using an action-grounded 3-D feature descriptor. Rather than using pose-invariant visual features, as is often the case with object recognition, we ground the features of objects with respect to their manipulation, that is, by using shape features that describe the surface of an object relative to the push contact point and direction. Using this setup, object push affordance learning trials are performed by a human and both pre-push and post-push object features are gathered, as well as push action trajectories. A self-supervised multi-view online learning algorithm is employed to bootstrap both the discovery of affordance classes in the post-push view, as well as a discriminative model for predicting them in the pre-push view. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of self-supervised class discovery, class prediction and feature relevance determination on a collection of unknown objects.",

        "abstract": "In a series of papers, we have formalized an active Bayesian perception approach for robotics based on recent progress in understanding animal perception. However, an issue for applied robot perception is how to tune this method to a task, using: (i) a belief threshold that adjusts the speed-accuracy tradeoff; and (ii) an active control strategy for relocating the sensor e.g. to a preset fixation point. Here we propose that these two variables should be learnt by reinforcement from a reward signal evaluating the decision outcome. We test this claim with a biomimetic fingertip that senses surface curvature under uncertainty about contact location. Appropriate formulation of the problem allows use of multi-armed bandit methods to optimize the threshold and fixation point of the active perception. In consequence, the system learns to balance speed versus accuracy and sets the fixation point to optimize both quantities. Although we consider one example in robot touch, we expect that the underlying principles have general applicability.",

We observe a significant improvement over passive methods that lack a sensorimotor loop for actively repositioning the sensor. The second part of this study then applies these findings about active perception to an example sensorimotor task in real-time. Using an appropriate online sensorimotor control architecture, the robot made decisions about what to do next and where to move next, which was applied to a contour-following task around several objects.

        "abstract": "This paper deals with speaker localization in two dimensions from a mobile binaural head. A bootstrap particle filtering scheme is used to perform active localization, i.e. to infer source location by fusing the binaural perception with the sensor motor commands. It relies on an original pseudo-likelihood of the source azimuth which captures both the interaural level and phase differences. Since the pseudo-likelihood is discrete, it is fitted with a mixture of circular distributions in order to enhance its resolution. For the fitting task two mixtures are compared and evaluated, namely the mixture of von Mises and wrapped Cauchy distributions. Furthermore, a solution is presented for calculating the von Mises curvefitting with low uncertainty, since the direct implementation can quickly surpass double precision floating number representation. The performance of the filter is compared using both the raw and fitted pseudo-likelihoods on experiments recorded in an acoustically prepared room with ground-truth obtained from a motion capture system. The results show that the proposed algorithm successfully localizes the speaker with an advantage in the direction of the fitted von Mises mixture likelihood.",

First, in the lateral plane, the exoskeleton was controlled to support the weight shift during stepping by providing assisting hip ab/adduction torques when the subject initiated a small amount of weight shift to the stance side to trigger a step. Second, the exoskeleton's hip ab/adduction during stepping was controlled to improve lateral stability. This was achieved by altering the amount of hip ab/adduction to change step width at heel strike. Using these controls, an able-bodied subject could walk in the exoskeleton without any external balance aids, i.e. crutches or a walker, where his hip and knee joints were controlled by the exoskeleton and his ankle joints were constrained by the exoskeleton. The next step is to test whether the proposed method improves balance in spinal cord injured subjects.",

        "abstract": "An evolutionary computational approach for a gait generation of a quadruped robot autonomously generates a gait that adapts in an environment. In this approach, a fitness function that measures a performance of the gait is defined and parameters are optimized by maximizing or minimizing the function with evolutionary computation algorithms. However the previous research only has considered the optimization on an environment. In this paper, we suggest a gait adaptation method for a quadruped robot using a terrain classification and a gait optimization for an adaptation on various surfaces. The surfaces for the adaptation are learnt with a classification algorithm and a gait parameter on each surface is optimized with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). After the learning and the optimization, the classifier is used for classifying a surface that a robot is located and an optimized gait parameter is selected based on the classification result for the adaptation. The adaptation framework, a feature design and a filtering method for a classifier and a gait design for a quadruped robot are proposed in this paper. The proposed method was verified in a realistic 3D simulator and it successfully classified surfaces and selected optimized gaits for adaptations.",

        "abstract": "Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) are effective for a wide range of applications ranging from kinodynamic planning to motion planning under uncertainty. However, RRTs are not as efficient when exploring heterogeneous environments and do not adapt to the space. For example, in difficult areas an expensive RRT growth method might be appropriate, while in open areas inexpensive growth methods should be chosen. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, Adaptive RRT, that adapts RRT growth to the current exploration area using a two level growth selection mechanism. At the first level, we select groups of expansion methods according to the visibility of the node being expanded. Second, we use a cost-sensitive learning approach to select a sampler from the group of expansion methods chosen. Also, we propose a novel definition of visibility for RRT nodes which can be computed in an online manner and used by Adaptive RRT to select an appropriate expansion method. We present the algorithm and experimental analysis on a broad range of problems showing not only its adaptability, but efficiency gains achieved by adapting exploration methods appropriately.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents an adaptive algorithm for checking collisions over any continuous robot motion set when tasks or constraints are given. As robots have begun to operate in human environments, which are unstructured and dynamically changing, the need for on-line robot planning and control strategies has increased. In implementing an on-line system, a fast and reliable collision checking method for continuous paths is a critical element. However, since external objects move unexpectedly, collision checking along the continuous path of a robot's motion suffers from increased uncertainty. Furthermore, computing the desired motion path or trajectory of a complex robotic task is very complex and slow. Therefore, we have developed a new collision checking strategy that can be applied to many types of motions that satisfy many given constraints. Our algorithm defines the applicable robot motions in a constraint-based manner, which is suitable for the multiple-task motion of a complex robot. This method can check the collision for the entire motion by finding the worst case with a small amount of computation, so that we can use the method for on-line applications. Moreover, our algorithm has a feature of adaptive resolution, which provides advantages in dynamically changing environments. The proposed method has been tested on high d.o.f. robots and the experimental results show that the method is suitable for on-line applications of multiple-tasks.",

A set of distributed collision and proximity sensors is used to aid in limiting collisions during direct control by the disabled user. Artificial neural networks adapt the use of the proximity sensors online, which limits movements in the direction of an obstacle before a collision occurs. The system learns by associating the different proximity sensors to the collision sensors where collisions are detected. This enables the user and the robot to adapt simultaneously and in real-time, with the objective of converging on a usage of the proximity sensors that increases performance for a given user, robot implementation and task-set. The system was tested in a controlled setting with a simulated 5 DOF assistive manipulator and showed promising reductions in the mean time on simplified manipulation tasks. It extends earlier work by showing that the approach can be applied to full multi-link manipulators.",

We manipulated motor outputs to control the sensory feedback of an insect using a brain-machine hybrid system. This system is composed of an insect's head and a two-wheeled mobile robot. The velocity of the robot is proportional to neural activities descending from an insect brain. We successfully manipulated the behavior of the robot. In disturbance experiments, insects responded to given rotational disturbances by modifying their neural activities to make compensative angular velocity. We assumed this control system of the compensation as an output-error model. We calculated the parameters under different motor gains to reveal it as an adaptive controller. We propose that an insect has its appropriate angular velocity during odor source localization, and performed simulation experiments involving an odor source searching agent and odor distribution environment. We calculated the cost for odor source localization by changing the angular velocity of the agent, and found that it had the minimum value.",

        "abstract": "Multi-robot cooperative manipulation of a common object requires precise kinematic coordination of the attached end effectors in order to avoid excessive forces on the object and the manipulators. A manipulation task is considered successful if the desired object motion and forces are tracked accurately. In this paper we present a systematic analysis on the effect of uncertain kinematic parameters on the tracking behavior in a planar manipulation task. An adaptive control scheme is proposed, which achieves the desired control goal asymptotically. The presented scheme employs the current force/motion data of the attached end effectors without relying on a common reference frame. The algorithm is applicable to common manipulator types with wrist-mounted force/torque sensors and implementable in real-time. The performance of the proposed control scheme is evaluated experimentally with two 7DoF manipulators who cooperatively manipulate an object of uncertain length.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, adaptive compensation of the hysteresis in a Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluid based actuators and its application for sensor-less high fidelity force/torque control is investigated. The MR actuator considered in this paper was originally described in [1] and [2]. This actuator offers high torque-to-mass and torque-to-inertia ratios. Yet, as an essential component of MR actuators, the magnetic circuit of the actuator shows hysteresis between its input current/voltage and output magnetic field. The hysteresis in the magnetic circuit results in a similar relationship between the input current and the output torque of the MR actuator. The control scheme used with actuators possessing hysteresis often requires compensating for the hysteresis. To this end, we propose an adaptive control method based on feedback linearization that estimates both hysteresis and uncertain parameters of the magnetic circuit. A set of experiments is performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of performing mid-ranging control of two closed-loop controlled systems that have internal saturations. The problem originates from previous work in machining with industrial robots, where an external compensation mechanism is used to compensate for position errors. Because of the limited workspace and the considerably higher bandwidth of the compensator, a mid-ranging control approach is proposed. An adaptive, modelbased solution is presented, which is verified through simulations and experiments, where a close correspondence of the obtained results is achieved. Comparing the IAE of experiments using the proposed controller to previously established methods, a performance increase of up to 56 % is obtained.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Probabilistic Roadmap Methods (PRMs) are widely used motion planning methods that sample robot configurations (nodes) and connect them to form a graph (roadmap) containing feasible trajectories. Many PRM variants propose different strategies for each of the steps and choosing among them is problem dependent. Planning in heterogeneous environments and/or on parallel machines necessitates dividing the problem into regions where these choices have to be made for each one. Hand-selecting the best method for each region becomes infeasible. In particular, there are many ways to select connection candidates, and choosing the appropriate strategy is input dependent. In this paper, we present a general connection framework that adaptively selects a neighbor finding strategy from a candidate set of options. Our framework learns which strategy to use by examining their success rates and costs. It frees the user of the burden of selecting the best strategy and allows the selection to change over time. We perform experiments on rigid bodies of varying geometry and articulated linkages up to 37 degrees of freedom. Our results show that strategy performance is indeed problem/region dependent, and our adaptive method harnesses their strengths. Over all problems studied, our method differs the least from manual selection of the best method, and if one were to manually select a single method across all problems, the performance can be quite poor. Our method is able to adapt to changing sampling density and learns different strategies for each region when the problem is partitioned for parallelism.",

In this work we present a 10 cm long novel robot, SailRoACH, the first running robot that uses aerodynamic forces to turn. We present a scale analysis of aerodynamic steering, showing this steering method is most effective for small robots. Modeling and simulations were performed, and validated with experiments, that showed the robot is capable of stably turning in a 1.2 m radius at 1.6 ms\u22121. We also show that aerodynamic steering is superior for high speed turns at high forward velocity, compared to existing methods. Additionally, aerodynamic steering allows us to introduce a constant yaw disturbance to the robot. This is useful for studying legged locomotion, and is difficult to achieve otherwise.",

Knowing what the environment, including other agents, can offer in terms of action capabilities is important for our day-to-day interaction and cooperation. In this paper, we will merge two complementary aspects of affordances: from agent-object perspective, what an agent afford to do with an object, and from agent-agent perspective, what an agent can afford to do for other agent, and present a unified notion of Affordance Graph. The graph will encode affordances for a variety of tasks: take, give, pick, put on, put into, show, hide, make accessible, etc. Another novelty will be to incorporate the aspects of effort and perspective-taking in constructing such graph. Hence, the Affordance Graph will tell about the action-capabilities of manipulating the objects among the agents and across the places, along with the information about the required level of efforts and the potential places. We will also demonstrate some interesting applications.",

        "abstract": "We propose a new method for the localization of a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) with respect to a ground robot. We solve the problem of registering the 3D maps computed by the robots using different sensors: a dense 3D reconstruction from the MAV monocular camera is aligned with the map computed from the depth sensor on the ground robot. Once aligned, the dense reconstruction from the MAV is used to augment the map computed by the ground robot, by extending it with the information conveyed by the aerial views. The overall approach is novel, as it builds on recent developments in live dense reconstruction from moving cameras to address the problem of air-ground localization. The core of our contribution is constituted by a novel algorithm integrating dense reconstructions from monocular views, Monte Carlo localization, and an iterative pose refinement. In spite of the radically different vantage points from which the maps are acquired, the proposed method achieves high accuracy whereas appearance-based, state-of-the-art approaches fail. Experimental validation in indoor and outdoor scenarios reported an accuracy in position estimation of 0.08 meters and real time performance. This demonstrates that our new approach effectively overcomes the limitations imposed by the difference in sensors and vantage points that negatively affect previous techniques relying on matching visual features.",

Using a spherical camera model, a visual predictive control scheme guides the aircraft around the object along a conical spiral trajectory. Visibility, state and control constraints are considered explicitly in the controller design by combining image and vehicle dynamics in the process model, and solving the nonlinear optimization problem over the resulting state space. Importantly, range is not required. Instead, the principles of conical spiral motion are used to design an objective function that simultaneously guides the aircraft along the avoidance trajectory, whilst providing an indication of the appropriate point to stop the spiral behaviour. Our approach is aimed at providing a potential solution to the See and Avoid problem for unmanned aircraft and is demonstrated through a series of experimental results using a small quadrotor platform.",

The most common source of the involuntary motions is physiological tremor. Real-time compensation of physiological tremor is therefore necessary to assist surgeons to accurately perform a microsurgery. A novel approach based on the use of Ionic Polymer Metallic Composites (IPMCs) has been developed for actively compensating physiological tremor in the hand. We present the design of our novel handheld device that compensates for tremor using an IPMC-based actuator. We then experimentally evaluate the device to show the amount of compensation achieved.",

        "abstract": "Multi-robot manipulation tasks are challenging for robots to complete in an entirely autonomous way due to the perceptual and cognitive requirements of grasp planning, necessitating the development of specialized user interfaces. Yet even for humans, the task is sufficiently complex that a high level of performance variability exists between a novice and an expert's ability to teleoperate the robots in a sufficiently tightly coupled fashion to manipulate objects without dropping them. The ultimate success of the task relies on the skill level of the human operator to manage and coordinate the robot team. Although most systems focus their effort on forging a unified connection between the robots and the operator, less attention has been spent on the problem of identifying and adapting to the human operator's skill level. In this paper, we present a method for modeling the human operator and adjusting the autonomy levels of the robots based on the operator's skill level. This added functionality serves as a crucial mechanism toward making human operators of any skill level a vital asset to the team even when their teleoperation performance is uneven.",

        "abstract": "Cylinder, a common geometric entity has a discontinuity at the joining of cylindrical surface and circular-disks. Hence, collision detection between two cylinders in space is a difficult task and few have reported formulations to solve it. In this paper, a novel analytical methodology is proposed to detect collision or intersection between two cylinders. The configuration, i.e., position and orientation, between the cylinders was represented using the four Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters plus two extra parameters. Dual Number Algebra was used to extract these six parameters. Tests involved in collision detection between the cylinders were between the lines and rectangles in a plane, thus considerably simplifying the problem of collision detection. As an illustration, an one-DOF arm modeled as a cylinder with cylindrical shaped obstacles were modeled and tested for their collisions. The results were validated with an analytical method available in the literature and a commercial software.",

The design principle of the joint is based on an asymmetric compliant antagonistic scheme which is actuated by two motors of different power capability and efficiency. Torques from the two motors are transmitted to the joint through two elastic elements of different stiffness and energy storage capacity. The proposed compliant joint design combines high power performance, large energy storage capacity and physical resilience all necessary features for performing high performance mobility such as agile locomotion. The paper introduces the principle of operation, the design and mechanical implementation of the joint. Preliminary experimental trials demonstrate the joint performance in a single degree of freedom leg prototype system.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an efficient part-based approach for action recognition. The main concept is to recognize human actions by less occluded parts without using a large set of part filters. Therefore, our approach is robust to occlusion and cost-effective. We extract spatiotemporal features from RGB-D videos, and assign a part-label to each feature. Then, for each part, a recognition score is computed for each action class by pyramid-structural bag of words (BoW-Pyramid) representation. The final result is determined by weighted sum of these scores and contextual information, which is based on the ratio of features between every pair of parts. Several contributions have been made in this work. First, the proposed part-based method is robust to occlusion and operates on-line. Second, our BoW-Pyramid representation can distinguish actions with reversed temporal orders. Third, recognition accuracy is increased by incorporating contextual information. The provided experimental results have verified effectiveness of our method and demonstrated high promise of surpassing performance of the state-of-the-art works.",

However, one of the drawbacks of fluid power systems have been large energy losses. In this paper, our research objective is to develop both energy-efficient and high performance motion controller for heavy-duty hydraulic manipulators. We apply an unconventional Servo Meter-In Meter-Out (SMIMO) hydraulic valve control setup that is used to decouple hydraulic actuator load pressure level from load force to improve energy efficiency. The developed control system is based on the Virtual Decomposition Control (VDC) approach to guarantee the closed-loop system stability of the multi degree of freedom heavy-duty hydraulic crane driven by the proposed novel SMIMO VDC controller. Capability for approximately 42% lower energy consumption was achieved in the Cartesian motion trajectory experiments with the proposed novel controller compared with a conventional 4-way servo valve setup, without significant control performance deterioration.",

        "abstract": "This work is developed in the framework of Institutional Robotics (IR), an approach to cooperative distributed robotic systems that draws inspiration from the social sciences. We consider a case study concerned with a swarm of simple robots which has to maintain wireless connectivity and a certain degree of spatial compactness. Robots have local, bounded communication capabilities and have to execute the task (running an IR controller) using exclusively as information their current number of wireless connections to neighbors. For the very same case study, we previously introduced an IR-based macroscopic model for the behavior of a large number of robots, validated using a submicroscopic model implemented through a realistic simulator. In this work, we go a step further and validate our submicroscopic model with real world experiments, duplicating accurately the conditions used, including a large number of robots and noisy communication channels. The main conclusions of this paper are two-fold. First, the IR approach was able to maintain the wireless connectivity of a swarm of 40 real, resource-constrained robots. This speaks in favor of the robustness and scalability of such approach. Second, the submicroscopic model implemented is faithfully capturing the reality and can be used to further optimize the performances of distributed control strategies using an IR approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the results of a study on the exploitation of compliance in structures made of self-reconfigurable modular robots \u2014 Roombots. This research was driven by the following three hypotheses: (1) compliance can improve locomotion performance; (2) different types of compliance will result in diverse locomotion behaviors; (3) control parameters optimized for a medium level of compliance will perform better for other values of compliance than parameters optimized for extremal compliance. Two types of in-series compliant elements were tested, with five different stiffness values for each of them, on a structure made of two Roombots modules. We ran dedicated on-line locomotion parameter optimizations for six different configurations and evaluated their performance for different stiffness values. Hypothesis 1 was confirmed for both types of compliant elements, with a peak of performance for an optimal level of compliance. The variety of locomotion strategies obtained for the different structures confirms hypothesis 2. Hypothesis 3 was only partially confirmed.",

In order to achieve such goals, a system should be very robust, allowing little chance for misunderstanding the user's commands. Moreover, the system should permit natural interaction reducing the time and the effort needed to achieve tasks. The main purpose of this work is to develop a general framework for flexible and multimodal human-robot communication. The proposed architecture should be easy to modify and expand, adding or modifying input channels and changing the multimodal fusion strategies. In this paper, we introduce our general approach and provide a case study with two modalities (gesture and speech).",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Cooperative manipulation in robotic teams likely results in an increased manipulation performance due to complementary sensing and actuation capabilities or increased redundancy. However, a precise coordination of the involved manipulators is required in order to avoid undesired stress on the manipulated object. Extending the workspace of the robots by means of mobile platforms greatly enlarges the potential task spectrum but simultaneously poses new challenges for example in terms of increased kinematic errors. In this paper we show how kinematic errors in the closed kinematic chain originating from uncertainties in the geometry of object and manipulators limit the cooperative task performance. We extend an impedance-based coordination control scheme towards mobile multi-robot manipulation to limit undesired internal forces in the presence of kinematic uncertainties. Furthermore, we employ a task-space decoupling approach to reduce the impact of disturbances at the mobile platforms on the end effectors. The presented control scheme for cooperative, mobile dualarm manipulation is applicable in real-time and suitable for a team of heterogeneous manipulators. We evaluate the presented architecture by means of a large-scale experiment with four 7DoF manipulators on two mobile platforms.",

Second, we present the drowsiness detection algorithm which integrates facial expression and racing wheel motion to recognize driver drowsiness. Third, a manual and autonomous driving switching mechanism is developed, which is triggered by the detection of drowsiness.

To combine the two types of systems, we present in this paper a meaningful interface, and insights into a methodology for developing interwoven symbolic-geometric domains. We concretely present this \u201clink\u201d between the two approaches with algorithms and data structures that amount to an intermediate layer that coordinates symbolic-geometric planning. Since both planners are capable of \u201cbacktracking\u201d at their own levels, we also investigate the issue of how to interleave their backtracking, which we do in the context of the algorithms that form the link.

A human driver reactively guides his vehicle, performing a smooth trajectory within the roads limits until reaching the defined goal. To obtain a similar behavior with an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), this paper proposes a flexible control law to drive a vehicle towards desired static or dynamic targets based on a novel definition of control variables and Lyapunov stability analysis. Moreover, a target assignment strategy, combined with an appropriate sigmoid function, that allow to perform smooth, flexible and safe vehicle navigation through successive waypoints is presented. The stability of the proposed control strategy is proved according to Lyapunov synthesis. Simulations and experiments are performed in different cases to demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of the control strategy.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, an under-actuated robotic hand is designed for realizing several different grasps. Three special transmissions are developed to realize the compact joint connected motion, connected motion among fingers and adduction/abduction. These transmissions reduce the volume and weight of the hand while maintain functions necessary for realizing desired grasps. The developed robotic hand can choose three different opposed positions of the thumb to realize four different grasps. Experiments are conducted to confirm that the robotic hand moves fast and stably grasp objects.",

        "abstract": "Traditional coaxial helicopter micro air vehicles use a large propeller motor in conjunction with two small servomotors to control thrust, pitch, and roll forces and moments. Quadrotors similarly generate these necessary forces and moments through the coordinated control of multiple actuators. We present a novel propeller architecture which allows a single motor and rotor to express such control by modulating the torque applied to one passively hinged, underactuated propeller. Flight tests of a two-motor coaxial helicopter demonstrate that such a system can provide active stability and control in a real flight system.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an ungrounded, hand-held surgical device that incorporates active constraints and force-feedback. Optical tracking of the device and embedded actuation allow for real-time motion compensation of a surgical tool as an active constraint is encountered. The active constraints can be made soft, so that the surgical tool tip motion is scaled, or rigid, so as to altogether prevent the penetration of the active constraint. Force-feedback is also provided to the operator so as to indicate penetration of the active constraint boundary by the surgical tool. The device has been evaluated in detailed bench tests to quantify its motion scaling and force-feedback capabilities. The combined effects of force-feedback and motion compensation are demonstrated during palpation of an active constraint with rigid and soft boundaries. A user study evaluated the combined effect of motion compensation and force-feedback in preventing penetration of a rigid active constraint. The results have shown the potential of the device operating in an ungrounded setup that incorporates active constraints with force-feedback.",

The LuGre friction model was employed as a basis for the current study and the model was extended and analyzed to include the impact of high-frequency vibration on translational friction. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the role of insertion speed as well as vibration frequency on frictional effects. In the experiments conducted, an 18 GA brachytherapy needle was vibrated and inserted into an ex-vivo soft tissue sample using a pair of amplified piezoelectric actuators. Analysis demonstrates that the translational friction can be reduced by introducing a vibratory low-amplitude motion onto a regular insertion profile, which is usually performed at a constant rate.",

We introduce the model of an active rimless wheel (RW) as the simplest walker for analysis and linearize the equation of motion incorporating a simple control torque. Through mathematical investigations, we finally derive the analytical solution to the transition function of the state error for the stance phase as a function only of the control parameters. We discuss the accuracy of the solution obtained through comparison with the values numerically-integrated in the linearized and the nonlinear walking models.",

        "abstract": "One increasingly popular approach for creating robot controllers for complex tasks is to automatically synthesize a hybrid controller from a high-level task specification. Such an approach, in addition to reducing the time and expertise required for creating a controller, guarantees that the robot will satisfy all of the underlying specifications, given perfect sensing and actuation. This paper investigates the probabilistic guarantees that can be made about the behavior of the robot when the actuation of the robot is no longer assumed to be perfect, as well as the possible specification revisions that can be made to improve the behavior of the robot. The approach described in this paper composes probabilistic models of the environment behavior and the robot actuation error with the synthesized controller, and uses probabilistic model checking techniques to find the probability that the robot satisfies a set of high level specifications. This paper also presents a preliminary approach for analyzing the composed model and automatically generating revisions to improve the robot's high-level behavior.",

The SLIP model is fundamentally limited in its ability to accurately represent legged locomotion since it does not take into account the impulsive dynamics of foot ground interaction. In this paper we investigate the control of a four-link hopping robot based on the complete dynamics of the system. Using partial feedback linearization to control the configuration in continuous time, and discrete parameter variations the control object of apex height control of the robot is achieved. Simulation results are presented to show the efficacy of the control scheme.",

In a previous work [11], we addressed metric and topological representations thanks to a multi-cameras system which allows building of dense visual maps of large scale 3D environments. The map is a set of locally accurate spherical panoramas related by 6d of poses graph. The work presented here is a further step toward a semantic representation. We aim at detecting the changes in the structural properties of the scene during navigation. Structural properties are estimated online using a global descriptor relying on spherical harmonics which are particularly well-fitted to capture properties in spherical views. A change-point detection algorithm based on a statistical Neyman-Pearson test allows us to find optimal transitions between topological places. Results are presented and discussed both for indoors and outdoors experiments.",

        "abstract": "Biologically-inspired robotic (biorobotic) platforms have been successfully adapted for engineering use, but it is difficult to extend these platforms' locomotive gaits to meet optimization goals. The gait spaces of biorobotic platforms can be very large, with multiple local optima and intractable numerical models. Further, the time cost of empirical exploration is often prohibitive. Micro-genetic algorithms have been successful in developing inverse kinematics in simulation, optimizing in spaces with numerous local optima, and working quickly to optimize with low numbers of trials, but have not yet been evaluated for online robotic gait development. To address the problem of engineering gait development in a biorobotic space, a micro-genetic algorithm (\u03bcGA) is evaluated on a biorobotic pectoral fin platform. The \u03bcGA effectively optimizes in the gait space with low time costs, discovering new gaits that optimize thrust force production on the swimming fin. The \u03bcGA also reveals parameter tuning strategies for changing propulsive forces. Overall, the \u03bcGA framework is shown to be effective at online optimization in a large, complex biorobotic gait space.",

This paper presents a hybrid nonlinear model of the PAM system and then proposes a systematic parameter identification procedure that uses a game-theoretic learning algorithm to obtain the appropriate parameter values for the modeling. With a practical example, finally, we verify the proposed method by illustrating a process of searching for the parameter values together with figures of after-and-before learning. As a result, we see that the resulting parameters are better than ones obtained by our previously-proposed heuristic and trial-and-error-based algorithm.",

In particular, we demonstrate the usefulness of our method in the scenario of building abstract semantic maps for indoor environments. The product of our system is a parametric abstract model of the perceived environment that not only accurately represents the geometry of the environment but also provides valuable abstract information which benefits highlevel robotic applications. Based on predefined abstract terms, such as \u201ctype\u201d and \u201crelation\u201d, we define task-specific context knowledge as descriptive rules in Markov Logic Networks. The corresponding inference results are used to construct a prior distribution that aims to add reasonable constraints to the solution space of semantic maps. In addition, by applying a semantically annotated sensor model, we explicitly use context information to interpret the sensor data. Experiments on real world data show promising results and thus confirm the usefulness of our system.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Tumor motion during irradiation reduces target coverage and increases dose to healthy tissues. Prediction of respiratory motion has the potential to substantially improve cancer radiation therapy. The respiratory motion is complex and its prediction is not a simple task, especially that breathing is controlled by the independent action of the diaphragm muscles and thorax. The diaphragm is the principal muscle used in the process of respiration and its modeling is essential for assessing the respiratory motion. In this context, an accurate patient-specific Finite Element (FE) based biomechanical model can be used to predict diaphragm deformation. In this paper, we have developed a FE model of the respiratory system including the diaphragm behavior and the complete thorax with musculoskeletal structure. These incorporate the ribs kinematics extracted directly from the Computed Tomography (CT) scan images. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our biomechanical model, a qualitative and quantitative comparison between the FE simulations and the CT scan images were performed. Upon application of linear elastic models, our results show that a linear elastic model can accurately predict diaphragm deformations. These comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed physically-based model. The developed computational model could be a valuable tool for respiratory system deformation prediction in order to be controlled and monitored by external sensors during the treatment.",

Existing toolboxes ask users to capture images of a calibration target in positions of their choosing, after which the maximum-likelihood calibration is computed using all images in a batch optimization. We introduce a new interactive methodology that uses the current calibration state to suggest the position of the target in the next image and to verify that the final model parameters meet the accuracy requirements specified by the user. Suggesting target positions relies on the ability to score candidate suggestions and their effect on the calibration. We describe two methods for scoring target positions: one that computes the stability of the focal length estimates for initializing the calibration, and another that subsequently quantifies the model uncertainty in pixel space. We demonstrate that our resulting system, AprilCal, consistently yields more accurate camera calibrations than standard tools using results from a set of human trials. We also demonstrate that our approach is applicable for a variety of lenses.",

FPCA is a statistical technique of functional data analysis that has never been applied before for humanoid imitation. In functional data analysis data (e.g. gestures) are functions that can be considered as observations of a random variable on a functional space. FPCA is an extension of multivariate PCA that provides functional principal components which describe the modes of variation in the data. In the proposed approach FPCA is used for both unsupervised clustering of training data and gesture recognition. In this work we focus on arm gesture recognition. Human hand paths in Cartesian space are reconstructed from inertial sensors. Recognized gestures are reproduced by a small humanoid robot. The FPCA algorithm has also been compared to a state of the art algorithm for gesture classification based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Results indicate that, in this domain, the FPCA algorithm achieves a comparable recognition rate while it outperforms DTW in terms of efficiency in execution time.",

We propose a model based on Markov processes to evaluate the need for coordination in multi-robot systems during the exploration of unknown environments and determine possible gains achievable through coordination. The model is illustrated by exploration of an indoor office environment. We qualitatively identify characteristics of environments which make coordination necessary and allow to quantitatively include them in the model. The expected gain through coordination highly depends on the environment. We further investigate the impact of team sizes. In favorable environments explicit coordination is not needed at the cost of increased team sizes. This helps to raise understanding of factors having an impact on coordination functions and making it possible to approximate a possible gain through coordination.",

        "abstract": "We present kinematics, actuation, detailed design, characterization results and initial user evaluations of AssistOn-Knee, a novel self-aligning active exoskeleton for robot-assisted knee rehabilitation. AssistOn-Knee can, not only assist flexion/extension movements of the knee joint but also accommodate its translational movements in the sagittal plane. Automatically aligning its joint axes, AssistOn-Knee enables an ideal match between human knee axis and the exoskeleton axis, guaranteeing ergonomy and comfort throughout the therapy. Self-aligning feature significantly shortens the setup time required to attach the patient to the exoskeleton, allowing more effective time spent on exercises. The proposed exoskeleton actively controls the rotational degree of freedom of the knee through a Bowden cable-driven series elastic actuator, while the translational movements of the knee joints are passively accommodated through use of a 3 degrees of freedom planar parallel mechanism. AssistOn-Knee possesses a lightweight and compact design with significantly low apparent inertia, thanks to its Bowden cable based transmission that allows remote location of the actuator and reduction unit. Furthermore, thanks to its series-elastic actuation, AssistOn-Knee enables high-fidelity force control and active backdrive-ability within its control bandwidth, while featuring passive elasticity for excitations above this bandwidth, ensuring safety and robustness throughout the whole frequency spectrum.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the multi-robot motion coordination planning problem is addressed. Although a centralized prioritized planning strategy can be used to solve the problem, we rather consider a decentralized variant, which is a more suitable for a robotic system of cooperating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) due to communication limitations, privacy concerns, and a better exploitation of computational resources distributed among the individual robots. However, the existing decentralized prioritized planning algorithm contains synchronization points that all the agents must be able to pass synchronously, which is impractical and inefficient for a real-world deployment of the robotic systems. Therefore, we introduce a new asynchronous decentralized prioritized planning algorithm and show that the method can converge faster than both the synchronous decentralized and centralized algorithms. Further, we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method as a coordination mechanism within a complex mission planning for a real robotic system consisting of several autonomous UAVs.",

Adversities such as switching of network topologies, agents joining or leaving the network, and communication link creation or failure may arise in these systems. To address these difficulties, we propose an asynchronous implementation of a distributed average consensus algorithm that has the following properties: (1) unbiased average, (2) homogeneous implementation, (3) robustness to network adversities, (4) dynamic consensus, and (5) well-defined tuning parameters. We demonstrate an application of the implementation on a specific distributed embedded system, the Distributed Flight Array, where we solve two average consensus problems to estimate altitude and tilt of the vehicle from multiple distance measurements.",

        "abstract": "Recently many researches have been studied to run autonomous flying vehicles. Especially, quadrotor VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) has been a challenging subject. To stabilize the quadrotor system, many control algorithms and sensor systems have been developed. Most of them are based on the sensors like accelerometer, gyroscope, or IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) to measure the attitude of quadrotor. Instead of using these conventional sensors, we apply one vision sensor to stabilize the attitude of a quadrotor system. To achieve this, four laser diodes are evenly distributed in the bottom plane of quadrotor, and then they point downwards. The positions of projected laser markers depend on the attitude and height of the quadrotor. We develop a control algorithm to stabilize the attitude as well as to control the height of a quadrotor. We show that the visual tracking of the laser markers is sufficient to estimate the state of the quadrotor attitude and control the attitude into a desired state.",

        "abstract": "Recent research in HRI has emphasized the need to design affective interaction systems equipped with social intelligence. A robot's awareness of its social role encompasses the ability to behave in a socially acceptable manner, the ability to communicate appropriately according to the situation, and the ability to detect the feelings of interactive partners, as humans do with one another. In this paper, we propose an intelligent robotic method of attracting a target person's attention in a way congruent to satisfying these social requirements. If the robot needs to initiate communication urgently, such as in the case of reporting an emergency, it does not need to consider the current situation of the person it is addressing. Otherwise, the robot should observe the person to ascertain who or what s/he is looking at (VFOA), and how attentively s/he is doing so (VFOA level). Moreover, the robot must identify an appropriate time at which to attract the target person's attention so as to not interfere with his/her work. We have realized just such a robotic system by developing computer vision methods to detect a target person's VFOA and its level, and testing the system's effectiveness in a series of experiments.",

A Head Related Transfer Function approach is adopted to virtualize auditory stimuli. When virtualized audio is used, the user has to focus the attention both on the type and location of the stimulus, thus generating P300 signals whose amplitude is higher than that generated without audio virtualization. Classification is performed by Support Vector Machines in which gaussian radial basis functions are used as kernel functions. The system has been validated with 14 users, who were asked to choose one among five common spoken words, previously virtualized and transmitted to stereophonic headphones. Classification results prove that the proposed auditory BCI system performed similarly to common visual BCI P300 systems, representing then an alternative to visual BCI for users with visual impairments.",

        "abstract": "The majority of neuroprosthetic interfaces, linking amputee to prosthetic hand, utilise proportional-based control through electromyography (EMG). The clinical translation of these interfaces can be attributed to their relative simplicity, usually requiring only two EMG electrodes to be placed on the flexor and extensor of the forearm. This bi-electrode setup enables opening and closing of hand grasp with an additional manual input used to cycle through the various grip patterns. In recent literature, the main focus has been on higher degree-of-freedom control leading to more complicated interfaces which can be considered the main barrier preventing their clinical utility. As such, new methods for grip pattern switching have not been explored with this fieldable strategy lacking any serious attention. In this work, a novel input, augmenting neuroprosthetic hand control, is proposed. This interface is based on bioacoustic signals generated through prescribed tongue movements. We demonstrate that such an interface can provide comparable performance to existing proportional-based systems without requiring any additional movements of the upper extremities.",

        "abstract": "Operating in vegetated environments is a major challenge for autonomous robots. Obstacle detection based only on geometric features causes the robot to consider foliage, for example, small grass tussocks that could be easily driven through, as obstacles. Classifying vegetation does not solve this problem since there might be an obstacle hidden behind the vegetation. In addition, dense vegetation typically needs to be considered as an obstacle. This paper addresses this problem by augmenting probabilistic traversability map constructed from laser data with ultra-wideband radar measurements. An adaptive detection threshold and a probabilistic sensor model are developed to convert the radar data to occupancy probabilities. The resulting map captures the fine resolution of the laser map but clears areas from the traversability map that are induced by obstacle-free foliage. Experimental results validate that this method is able to improve the accuracy of traversability maps in vegetated environments.",

In this paper, we investigate techniques for automatically aligning symbolic task descriptions. We propose to adapt and extend established algorithms for sequence alignment that are commonly used in bioinformatics in order to make them applicable to robot action specifications. The extensions include methods for the comparison of complex sequence elements, for taking the semantic similarity of actions into account, and for aligning descriptions at different levels of granularity. We evaluate the algorithm on two large datasets of observations of human everyday tasks and show that they are able to align action sequences performed by different subjects in very different ways.",

        "abstract": "Microinjection and biopsy of oocytes and embryos in Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) require highly delicate handling of cells. In particular, efficient control of cell orientation is necessary to maintain their integrity during tool penetration, which currently remains challenging to accomplish by the existing method of repeated aspiration/release via micropipette. We present a microfluidic platform to automate the process of cell orientation control and trapping by means of hydrodyanmic force and vision-based position control. The device is accessible by conventional micropipettes via a cavity, allowing immobilized cells to be operated on. An orientation control algorithm based on the movement of the embryo within the microchannel is proposed. Visual tracking of the polar body is used to provide the information of cell orientation. Experimental results with mouse embryos indicate that cell orientation can be systematically controlled autonomously without human intervention and therefore provides a framework for further development of robotics approach to precise manipulation of microparticles within microfluidic devices.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents recent developments in data processing of multi-year repeat survey imagery and precision automatic registration for monitoring long-term changes in benthic marine habitats such as coral reefs and kelp forests. Three different methods are presented and compared for precision alignment of imagery maps collected over a range of time-scales from 12 hours to two years between dives. The first method uses Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features computed over imagery mosaics to compute the relative translational offset between repeat dives. The second method employs scan-optimisation using the bathymetry generated via structure-from-motion thus capturing more stable features in the environment, lending itself to larger timescale registration. The third method uses mutual information optimisation to register imagery maps, providing robustness to changes in the colour and brightness of objects in an underwater scene across multiple years. Results are presented from field data collected using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) in sites across the Australian coast between 2009 and 2011.",

Our calibration method is based on the comparative alignment of output gradients from two candidate sensors. The algorithm is applied to the calibration of the extrinsic parameters of several camera-lidar systems. In this calibration the lidar scan is projected onto the camera's image using a camera model. Particle swarm optimization is used to find the optimal parameters for this model. This method requires no markers to be placed in the scene. While the system can use a set of scans, unlike many existing techniques it can also automatically calibrate the system reliably using a single scan. The method presented is successfully validated on a variety of cameras, lidars and locations. It is also compared to three existing techniques and shown to give comparable or superior results on the datasets tested.",

To develop more effective driving assist systems, abstractive recognition of driving situation performed just like a human driver is important in order to achieve fully cooperative driving between the driver and vehicle. To achieve human-like annotation of driving behavioral data and image sequences, we first divided continuous driving behavioral data into discrete symbols that represent driving situations. Then, using multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation, latent driving topics laid on each driving situation were estimated as a relation model among driving behavioral data, image sequences, and human-annotated tags. Finally, automatic annotation of the behavioral data and image sequences can be achieved by calculating the predictive distribution of the annotations via estimated latent-driving topics. The proposed method intuitively annotated more than 50,000 pieces of frame data, including urban road and expressway data. The effectiveness of the estimated drive topics was also evaluated by analyzing the performances of driving-situation classification. The topics represented the drive context efficiently, i.e., the drive topics lead to a 95% lower-dimensional feature space and 6% higher accuracy compared with a high-dimensional raw-feature space. Moreover, the drive topics achieved performance almost equivalent performance to human annotators, especially in classifying traffic jams and the number of lanes.",

Piecewise Affine (PWA) models are used to approximate the observed nonlinear system dynamics of a hexapedal millirobot. The high dimension of the state space (16) and very large number of state observations (~100,000) motivated the use of statistical clustering methods to automatically choose the submodel regions. Comparisons of models with 1 to 50 PWA regions are analyzed with respect to state derivative prediction and forward simulation accuracy. Derivative prediction accuracy was shown to reduce average in-axis absolute error by up to 52% compared to a null estimator. Simulation results show tracking of state trajectories over one stride length, and the degradation of simulation prediction is analyzed across model complexity and time horizon. We describe metrics for comparing the performance of different model complexities across one-step and simulation predictions.",

The main challenge is to accurately align the robot axis with the pipe axis to enable the rotary motion of the maintenance tool. The tool system for cleaning and sealing is mounted on the maintenance unit of the robot consisting of six wheeled-legs. These legs extend to the irregular cast-iron pipe and set the robot structure eccentric to the pipe's center. In order to center the maintenance unit, distance sensors on the legs allow to adapt to the noncircular shape of the pipe. Correcting the leg extension allows to obtain better positioning of the cleaning tool.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increasing demand to digitize a huge number of books. A promising new approach for meeting this demand, called Book Flipping Scanning, has been proposed. This is a new style of scanning in which all pages of a book are captured while a user continuously flips through the pages without stopping at each page. Although this new technology has had a tremendous impact in the field of book digitization, page turning is still done manually, which acts as a bottleneck in the development of high-speed book digitization. Against this background, this paper proposes a newly designed high-speed, high-precision book page turner machine. Our machine turns the pages in a contactless manner by utilizing the elastic force of the paper and an air blast. This design enables high-speed performance that is ten times faster than conventional approaches and, in addition, causes no obstruction in the digitization process. This paper reports the evaluation of the proposed machine using various types of paper with different qualities. Our machine achieved almost 100% success rate when turning pages at around 300 pages/min, showing that it is a promising technology for turning pages at high-speed and with high precision.",

The main goal of our work is to provide advanced cognitive abilities for such robotic systems to make them more aware of the outcome of their actions. We describe how such symbolic relations are automatically extracted for configurations of box-shaped objects using notions from geometry and static equilibrium in classical mechanics. We also present extensive simulation results as well as some real-world experiments aimed at verifying the output of the proposed approach.",

These simple models have significantly fewer degrees of freedom than the full robot model. The design and choice of these simple models are based on the designer's intuition, and the reduced state mapping and the control input mapping are manually chosen. This paper presents an automatic model reduction procedure for humanoid robots, which is task-specific.

        "abstract": "We develop a method for the control of discrete-time nonlinear systems subject to temporal logic specifications. Our approach uses a coarse abstraction of the system and an automaton representing the temporal logic specification to guide the search for a feasible trajectory. This decomposes the search for a feasible trajectory into a series of constrained reachability problems. Thus, one can create controllers for any system for which techniques exist to compute (approximate) solutions to constrained reachability problems. Representative techniques include sampling-based methods for motion planning, reachable set computations for linear systems, and graph search for finite discrete systems. Our approach avoids the expensive computation of a discrete abstraction, and its implementation is amenable to parallel computing. We demonstrate our approach with numerical experiments on temporal logic motion planning problems with high-dimensional (10+ states) continuous systems.",

        "abstract": "A continuum manipulator, such as a multi-section trunk/tentacle robot, is promising for deft manipulation of a wide range of objects of different shapes and sizes. Given an object, a continuum manipulator tries to grasp it by wrapping tightly around it. Autonomous grasping requires realtime determination of whether an object can be grasped after it is identified, and if so, the feasible whole-arm wrapping around configurations of the robot to grasp it, which we call grasping configurations, as well as the path leading to a grasping configuration. In this paper, we describe the process for autonomous grasping from object detection to executing the grasping motion and achieving force-closure grasps, with a focus on a general analysis of all possible types of planar grasping configurations of a three-section continuum manipulator. We further provide conditions for existence of solutions and describe how to find a valid grasping configuration and the associated path automatically if one exists. Experimental results with the OctArm manipulator validate our approach, and shows that the entire process to determine an autonomous grasping operation, which includes automatic detection of the target object and determination of a grasping configuration and a path to the grasping configuration that avoids obstacles, can take just a small fraction of a second. Once a grasping configuration is reached, the manipulator can lift the object stably, i.e., a force-closure grasp can be achieved.",

Secondly, the application of learning by demonstration alleviates the complexity of robotic programming and allows extracting operator-specific knowledge in situ in a natural and intuitive way. The provision of incorporating force information can further improve the versatility of the system, allowing easy adaptation to different dynamic environments.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we focus on the problem of landing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in unknown and Global Navigation Satellite System(GNSS)-denied environments based on an infrared stereo vision system. This system is fixed on the ground and used to track the UAV's position during the landing process. In order to enlarge the search field of view (FOV), a pan-tilt unit (PTU) is employed to actuate the vision system. The infrared camera is chosen as the exteroceptive sensor for two main reasons: first, it can be used under all weather conditions and around the clock; second, infrared targets can be tracked based on infrared spectrum features at a lower computational cost compared to tracking texture features in visible spectrum. State-of-the-art active contour based algorithms and the mean shift algorithm have been evaluated with regard to detecting and tracking an infrared target. Field experiments have been carried out using an unmanned quadrotor and a fixed-wing unmanned aircraft, with both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The results demonstrate that our system can track UAVs without artificial markers and is sufficient to enhance or replace the GNSS-based localization in GNSS-denied environment or where its information is inaccurate.",

        "abstract": "Underwater acoustic communication channels display highly variable and stochastic performance, especially in multipath-limited shallow-water and harbor environments. A mobile acoustic node can, however, learn the channel's properties as it moves about. Maximizing the cumulative data transmission through adaptive node positioning is a clean exploitation vs. exploration scenario because learning about poorly characterized locations must be balanced against exploiting known ones. While this problem is well described with the stochastic multi-armed bandit formalism, the classical assumption of costless switching is untenable in the field, where slow-moving vehicles often cover large distances. We present a heuristic adaptation to the MAB Gittins index rule with limited policy enumeration to account for switching costs, and describe field experiments conducted in the Charles River (Boston MA). The field data establish that the MAB and its switching cost extension are tractable in this application, and that performance is consistently superior to that of \u03f5-greedy policies.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a method for autonomously tuning the threshold between learning and recognizing a place in the world, based on both how the rodent brain is thought to process and calibrate multisensory data and the pivoting movement behaviour that rodents perform in doing so. The approach makes no assumptions about the number and type of sensors, the robot platform, or the environment, relying only on the ability of a robot to perform two revolutions on the spot. In addition, it self-assesses the quality of the tuning process in order to identify situations in which tuning may have failed. We demonstrate the autonomous movement-driven threshold tuning on a Pioneer 3DX robot in eight locations spread over an office environment and a building car park, and then evaluate the mapping capability of the system on journeys through these environments. The system is able to pick a place recognition threshold that enables successful environment mapping in six of the eight locations while also autonomously flagging the tuning failure in the remaining two locations. We discuss how the method, in combination with parallel work on autonomous weighting of individual sensors, moves the parameter dependent RatSLAM system significantly closer to sensor, platform and environment agnostic operation.",

        "abstract": "Many intriguing science discoveries on planetary surfaces, such as the seasonal flows on crater walls and skylight entrances to lava tubes, are at sites that are currently inaccessible to state-of-the-art rovers. The in situ exploration of such sites is likely to require a tethered platform both for mechanical support and for providing power and communication. Mother/daughter architectures have been investigated where a mother deploys a tethered daughter into extreme terrains. Deploying and retracting a tethered daughter requires undocking and re-docking of the daughter to the mother, with the latter being the challenging part. In this paper, we describe a vision-based tether-assisted algorithm for the autonomous re-docking of a daughter to its mother following an extreme terrain excursion. The algorithm uses fiducials mounted on the mother to improve the reliability and accuracy of estimating the pose of the mother relative to the daughter. The tether that is anchored by the mother helps the docking process and increases the system's tolerance to pose uncertainties by mechanically aligning the mating parts in the final docking phase. A preliminary version of the algorithm was developed and field-tested on the Axel rover in the JPL Mars Yard. The algorithm achieved an 80% success rate in 40 experiments in both firm and loose soils and starting from up to 6 m away at up to 40\u00b0 radial angle and 20\u00b0 relative heading. The algorithm does not rely on an initial estimate of the relative pose. The preliminary results are promising and help retire the risk associated with the autonomous docking process enabling consideration in future martian and lunar missions.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (or drones) are very frequently used for servicing a geographic region in numerous applications. Given a geographic territory and a set of n fixed vehicle depots, we consider the problem of designing service districts so as to balance the workload of a collection of vehicles which service this region. We assume that the territory is a connected polygonal region, i.e. a simply connected polygon containing a set of simply connected obstacles. We give a fast algorithm, based on an infinite-dimensional optimization formulation, that divides the territory into compact, connected sub-regions, each of which contains a vehicle depot, such that all regions have equal area. We also show how we can use this algorithm to find better locations of the vehicle depots.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents non-field-of-view (NFOV) target estimation incorporating an acoustic sensor, which consists of two microphones. The proposed approach derives the interaural level difference (ILD) of observations from the two microphones for different target positions and stores the ILDs as database a priori. Given a new acoustic observation on a target, an acoustic observation likelihood is created by calculating the correlation of the ILD of the new observation to the stored ILDs. A joint observation likelihood is then developed by fusing the optical and acoustic observation likelihoods, and the recursive Bayesian estimation updates and maintains belief on the target using the joint observation likelihood. The proposed approach detects a target positively using an acoustic sensor even if it is outside the field of view of the optical sensor and localizes the target accurately by estimating it within the RBE. The efficacy of the proposed approach was first validated by experimental studies. Further numerical demonstrations then show the applicability of the proposed approach to the NFOV target estimation.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the application of a Bayesian nonparametric time-series model to process monitoring and fault classification for industrial robotic tasks. By means of an alignment task performed with a real robot, we show how the proposed approach allows to learn a set of sensor signature models encoding the spatial and temporal correlations among wrench measurements recorded during a number of successful task executions. Using these models, it is possible to detect continuously and on-line deviations from the expected sensor readings. Separate models are learned for a set of possible error scenarios involving a human modifying the workspace configuration. These non-nominal task executions are correctly detected and classified with an on-line algorithm, which opens the possibility for the development of error-specific recovery strategies. Our work is complementary to previous approaches in robotics, where process monitors based on probabilistic models, but limited to contact events, were developed for control purposes. Instead, in this paper we focus on capturing dynamic models of sensor signatures throughout the whole task, therefore allowing continuous monitoring and extending the system ability to interpret and react to errors.",

In order to construct its three-dimensional non-homogeneous structure, we took sequence of magnetic resonant images, which bring consecutive cross-sectional layers of the human fingertip with distribution of skin, tissue, bone, and nail. Simulation results show a twofold aspect. Firstly, it can generate not only normal force distribution caused by pushing, but also response of friction force during sliding. Secondly, and more interestingly, the model dynamically produces localized displacement phenomenon on the contact area during stick-to-slip phase, which indicates how slippage erodes the contact area before the total slippage of the fingertip occurs. Finally, we investigated role of sliding mechanism acting on human fingertips' contact area in stable lifting of an object, in order to show the potential of the model in studying tactile mechanism of human and apply to robotic systems.",

In addition, we propose a method to control the antagonistic exoskeleton based on the actuators kinematics. The developed twisted strings-driven elbow exoskeleton can be effectively used in a variety of haptics, teleoperation, and rehabilitation applications.",

        "abstract": "It is widely known that the problem of controlling a rigid bilateral teleoperator with time-delays has been effectively addressed since the late 80's. However, the control of flexible joint manipulators in a bilateral teleoperation scenario, with dynamic gravity compensation, remains an open problem. This work aims at filling this gap by presenting a new controller for bilateral teleoperators composed of a rigid local manipulator and a flexible-joint remote manipulator with dynamic gravity compensation and asymmetric variable time-delays in the communication channel. In order to dynamically compensate the gravity term, in the flexible joint manipulator, a change of coordinates which accounts for the joint and link gravity position drift is used. The rest of the controller is a simple PD scheme. Assuming that the human operator and the environment define passive maps from velocity to force, it is proved that velocities and local and remote position errors are bounded. Additionally, if the human operator and remote environment forces are zero then velocities asymptotically converge to zero and position tracking is established. Some simulations are presented in order to show the performance of the proposed controllers.",

        "abstract": "A new system for object detection in cluttered RGB-D images is presented. Our main contribution is a new method called Bingham Procrustean Alignment (BPA) to align models with the scene. BPA uses point correspondences between oriented features to derive a probability distribution over possible model poses. The orientation component of this distribution, conditioned on the position, is shown to be a Bingham distribution. This result also applies to the classic problem of least-squares alignment of point sets, when point features are orientation-less, and gives a principled, probabilistic way to measure pose uncertainty in the rigid alignment problem. Our detection system leverages BPA to achieve more reliable object detections in clutter.",

        "abstract": "Frictional influences in tendon-driven robotic systems are generally unwanted, with efforts towards minimizing them where possible. In the human hand however, the tendon-pulley system is found to be frictional with a difference between high-loaded static post-eccentric and post-concentric force production of 9-12% of the total output force. This difference can be directly attributed to tendon-pulley friction. Exploiting this phenomenon for robotic and prosthetic applications we can achieve a reduction of actuator size, weight and consequently energy consumption. In this study, we present the design of a bio-inspired friction switch. The adaptive pulley is designed to minimize the influence of frictional forces under low and medium-loading conditions and maximize it under high-loading conditions. This is achieved with a dual-material system that consists of a high-friction silicone substrate and low-friction polished steel pins. The system is described and its behavior experimentally validated with respect to the number and spacing of pins. The results validate its intended behavior, making it a viable choice for robotic tendon-driven systems.",

        "abstract": "Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) have been successful at finding feasible solutions for many types of problems. With motion planning becoming more computationally demanding, we turn to parallel motion planning for efficient solutions. Existing work on distributed RRTs has been limited by the overhead that global communication requires. A recent approach, Radial RRT, demonstrated a scalable algorithm that subdivides the space into regions to increase the computation locality. However, if an obstacle completely blocks RRT growth in a region, the planning space is not covered and is thus not probabilistically complete. We present a new algorithm, Blind RRT, which ignores obstacles during initial growth to efficiently explore the entire space. Because obstacles are ignored, free components of the tree become disconnected and fragmented. Blind RRT merges parts of the tree that have become disconnected from the root. We show how this algorithm can be applied to the Radial RRT framework allowing both scalability and effectiveness in motion planning. This method is a probabilistically complete approach to parallel RRTs. We show that our method not only scales but also overcomes the motion planning limitations that Radial RRT has in a series of difficult motion planning tasks.",

Our aim is to modularize applications by factoring out environment, task-, domain-, and robot-specific knowledge components and representing them explicitly in a formal knowledge base that is shared between the robots and service applications. Robot control decisions can then be formulated in terms of inference tasks that are evaluated based on this knowledge during task execution. The explicit and modular knowledge representation allows human operators with different areas of expertise to adapt the respective parts of the knowledge independently. We implemented this concept by integrating knowledge representation methods of the RoboEarth project with the distributed task execution capabilities of the Ubiquitous Network Robot Platform.",

        "abstract": "A widely used technique for constructing two dimensional maps employing range sensors is occupancy grid mapping assuming normal distributed sensor errors. An alternative to the grid map model with its fixed grid cell size are variable resolution grid maps, e.g. quadtrees. In this paper, the authors propose an approach for building occupancy quadtree maps assuming unknown but bounded sensor errors. Therefore, they examine possible types of sensor uncertainty when using laser rangefinders. They show that the majority of possible types of sensor errors can be covered much better by bounded error models than by probabilistic models. Hence, a novel inverse sensor model has been developed that incorporates measurement and pose uncertainty in a mathematical straightforward way using interval analysis. With this model, an approach for incrementally building occupancy quadtree maps is proposed. A first real world experiment has shown the applicability of the approach. Moreover, the authors compare the map with its probabilistic grid map counterpart. The bounded error quadtree has proved to be conservative but more reliable than the conventional probabilistic grid map.",

        "abstract": "We present an algorithm for providing a dynamic model of sensor measurements. Rather than depending on a model of the vehicle state and environment to capture the distribution of possible sensor measurements, we provide an approximation that allows the sensor model to depend on the measurement itself. Building on previous work, we show how the sensor model predictor can be learned from data without access to ground truth labels of the vehicle state or true underlying distribution, and we show our approach to be a generalization of non-parametric kernel regressors. Our algorithm is demonstrated in simulation and on real world data for both laser-based scan matching odometry and RGB-D camera odometry in an unknown map. The performance of our algorithm is shown to quantitatively improve estimation, both in terms of consistency and absolute accuracy, relative to other algorithms and to fixed covariance models.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach for the synthesis of grasps of objects whose geometry can be observed only in the presence of noise. We focus in particular on the problem of generating caging grasps with a realistic robot hand simulation and show that our method can generate such grasps even on complex objects. We introduce the idea of using geodesic balls on the object's surface in order to approximate the maximal contact surface between a robotic hand and an object. We define two types of heuristics which extract information from approximate geodesic balls in order to identify areas on an object that can likely be used to generate a caging grasp. Our heuristics are based on two scoring functions. The first uses winding angles measuring how much a geodesic ball on the surface winds around a dominant axis, while the second explores using the total discrete Gaussian curvature of a geodesic ball to rank potential caging postures. We evaluate our approach with respect to variations in hand kinematics, for a selection of complex real-world objects and with respect to its robustness to noise.",

While the single dot laser range finder can only provide depth for a single pixel in the observed image, it's cost and size can be useful for handheld devices or very lightweight robotic platforms. In this work, we propose two accurate calibration methods for determining the position and direction of the laser range finder with respect to the camera. Notably, we can determine the full calibration, even without observing the laser range finder observation point in the camera image. We evaluate both methods on synthetic and real data demonstrating their efficiency and good behavior under noise.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Multiple cameras are increasingly prevalent on robotic and human-driven vehicles. These cameras come in a variety of wide-angle, fish-eye, and catadioptric models. Furthermore, wheel odometry is generally available on the vehicles on which the cameras are mounted. For robustness, vision applications tend to use wheel odometry as a strong prior for camera pose estimation, and in these cases, an accurate extrinsic calibration is required in addition to an accurate intrinsic calibration. To date, there is no known work on automatic intrinsic calibration of generic cameras, and more importantly, automatic extrinsic calibration of a rig with multiple generic cameras and odometry. We propose an easy-to-use automated pipeline that handles both intrinsic and extrinsic calibration; we do not assume that there are overlapping fields of view. At the begining, we run an intrinsic calibration for each generic camera. The intrinsic calibration is automatic and requires a chessboard. Subsequently, we run an extrinsic calibration which finds all camera-odometry transforms. The extrinsic calibration is unsupervised, uses natural features, and only requires the vehicle to be driven around for a short time. The intrinsic parameters are optimized in a final bundle adjustment step in the extrinsic calibration. In addition, the pipeline produces a globally-consistent sparse map of landmarks which can be used for visual localization. The pipeline is publicly available as a standalone C++ package.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with dense visual tracking robust towards scene perturbations using 3D information to provide a space-time coherency. The proposed method is based on an piecewise-planar scenes visual tracking algorithm which aims to minimize an error between an observed image and a reference template by estimating the parameters of a rigid 3D transformation taking into acount the relative positions of the planes in the scene. The major drawback of this approch stems from the registration function used to perform the minimization (the sum of squared differences) as it is very poorly robust towards scene variations. In this paper, the tracking process is adapted to take into account two more complex registration functions. First, the sum of conditional variance. Since it is invariant to global illumination variations, the proposed algorithm is robust with relation to those conditions whilst keeping a low computation complexity. Then, the mutual information is considered. In that case the complexity is greater but so is the robustness towards non global illumination variations, specularities or occlusions. The proposed approaches, after being described, are tested on different scenes under varying illumination conditions to assess their respective efficiency.",

We first give a brief review of its kineto-statics and derive its reduced Cartesian stiffness model. To illustrate the stiffness enhancement of OW5 under redundant and antagonistic actuation, its Cartesian stiffness is measured and evaluated under four control schemes: the non-redundant control, the minimum 2-norm torque control without or with redundant encoder, and the antagonistic actuation control. Measurement data are represented using stiffness matrices and stiffness ellipses. Our study offers a quick quantitative evaluation of stiffness enhancement of OW5 under redundant and antagonistic actuation.",

The characteristic features are weakness, spasticity, muscle contractures, and poor motor coordination. The gait patterns of children with CP are slow, uncoordinated, and unstable. Our hypothesis is that these impaired children will benefit from robot enhanced walkers to improve their balance, coordination, and speed during gait. In addition, this experience will also impact their clinical scores that relate to their functional performance and caregiver assistance. In this study, we used a specially-designed robotic walker which children used to perform a series of walking tasks, in increasing order of difficulty. This study was performed in 30 training sessions over a period of 3 months. Each training session lasted for 20 minutes. The outcome measures were variables recorded by the robot such as travel distance, average speed, and clinical measured variables that characterize their disability profiles.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a fast computation method of hydraulic robot dynamics and shows the effectiveness in design optimization that needs a lot of repetitive simulation. First, an exact simplification of the conventional representation of hydraulic robots with external forces is presented based on the Casimir functions. Second, a further exact simplification is given via an integration by parts of the Hamiltonian function as a structural property and a new representation of the hydraulic robots is proposed. The new representation allows us to define a back fluidmotive force (back-FMF) as a hydraulic version of the well-known back electromotive force (back-EMF). Third, the proposed representation and the conventional representation are compared with each other with respect to computational cost and the effectiveness of the proposed representation is confirmed.",

This paper evaluates controllable adhesion using magneto-rheological fluid (MRF) as a technique to stick to non-magnetic materials and rough/dusty surfaces. This technique is both simple to use and robust to uncertain surface conditions, as it involves applying MRF on a surface and activating it with a magnetic field. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate yield stresses in both normal and shear directions with respect to MRF layer thickness, magnetic flux density and surface type. Based on these results, a four-legged climbing robot is designed to demonstrate scaling vertical walls and shows effectiveness of the controllable adhesion using MRF for rough surface.",

Nowadays, new generation of pneumatic actuator made out of highly compliant elastomers, which we call soft pneumatic actuators (SPA), are drawing increasing attention due to their ease of fabrication, high customizability and innately softness. However, there is no effective method presented to characterize and understand these actuators, such as to measure the force and torque output, range of motion and the speed of actuation. In this work, we present two types of SPAs: bending and rotary actuators. In addition, we have developed two measurement setups to characterize actuators of different geometries. The measured force/torque outputs of different actuators are presented and analyzed. Step responses to certain pressure input are presented and discussed. A simple model is presented to provide physical insight to the observed behavior of the soft actuators. This work provides the basis for designing customized SPAs with application-specific requirements.",

        "abstract": "The algorithm for finding the time-optimal parameterization of a given path subject to dynamics constraints developed mostly in the 80's and 90's plays a central role in a number of important robotic theories and applications. A critical issue in its implementation is associated with the so-called dynamic singularities, i.e. the points where the maximum velocity curve is continuous but undifferentiable and where the minimum and maximum accelerations are not naturally defined. Since such singularities arise in most real-world problem instances, characterizing and addressing them appropriately is of particular interest. Yet, from original articles to reference textbooks, this has not yet been done completely correctly. The contribution of the present article is two-fold. First, we derive a complete characterization of dynamic singularities. In particular, we show that not all zero-inertia points are dynamically singular. Second, we suggest how to appropriately address these singularities. In particular, we derive the analytic expressions of the correct optimal backward and forward accelerations from such points.",

We prove the Lipschitz continuity of Q and provide an explicit Lipschitz bound that can be used to infer the stability of grasps lying in a neighbourhood of a known grasp. We think of Q\u2212l as a lower bound estimate to Q and describe an algorithm for computing an upper bound Q+. We provide worst-case error bounds relating Q and Q\u2212l. Furthermore, we develop a novel grasp hypothesis rejection algorithm which can exclude unstable grasps much faster than current implementations. Our algorithm is based on a formulation of the grasp quality evaluation problem as an optimization problem, and we show how our algorithm can be used to improve the efficiency of sampling based grasp hypotheses generation methods.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, a new enhanced CRF for discriminating between different materials in natural scenes using terrestrial multi spectral imaging is established. Most of the existing formulations of the CRF often suffer from over smoothing and loss of small detail, thereby deteriorating the information from the underlying unary classifier in areas with a high spatial frequency. This work specifically addresses this issue by incorporating a new pairwise potential that is better at taking local context into account. Certain materials are very unlikely to appear next to each other in the scene and such configurations are penalised by employing the confusion matrix of the unary classifier. Similarly, horizontal as well as vertical configurations, which may be more or less likely for certain combinations of materials, are regarded in this formulation. Furthermore, the proposed pairwise potential also considers the length of boundaries between regions to account for the segmentation granularity issues and also uses class probabilities of the neighbouring regions to make up for the uncertainty of the unary classifier results. Seven band terrestrial multi spectral imaging were used due to its potential in distinguishing between different materials and objects. The proposed approach was evaluated using cross-validation, resulting in an average accuracy of 88.9% which is about 17% more than the accuracy of a standard CRF, which demonstrates the superiority of our approach in preserving local details.",

The control method consists of the tracking controller, the shifting method of the robot's part connecting between the planes, and the active lifting for controlling the shape of the robot. Simulations and experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed controller and the shifting method of the connecting part of the robot's body.",

A closed loop control of the CoP position based on somatosensory feedback is developed. This control strategy allows both setpoint tracking and path following of the CoP. The effectiveness of the proposed somatosensory feedback is assessed through experiments involving 11 naive subjects.",

Micromachined tweezers have already been used for the characterization of mechanical properties of DNA molecules [1] as well as for the sensing of enzymatic reactions on DNA bundle [2], [3]. However the resolution of the experiments does not allow the sensing on single molecules. Hereafter we show theoretically and experimentally that, reducing the resonance frequency of the system by the implementation of a state feedback, the sensitivity to stiffness variation is enhanced. Such improvement leads to better resolution for detection of enzymatic reactions on DNA [4].",

        "abstract": "Manipulation and transport of objects using mobile robotic platforms is a well studied field with several successful approaches. The main difficulty while using such platforms is the lack of adaptation capabilities to changes in the environment and the restriction to flat working areas. In this paper, we present a novel manipulation and transport framework using the self-reconfigurable modular robots Roombots to collaboratively carry arbitrarily shaped passive elements in a non-regular 3D environment equipped with passive connectors. A hierarchical planner based on the notion of virtual kinematic chain is used to generate collision-free and hardware-friendly paths as well as sequences of collaborative manipulations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of manipulation of fully passive elements in an arbitrary 3D environment using mobile self-reconfigurable robots. The simulated results show that the planner is robust to arbitrary complex environments with randomly distributed connectors. In addition to simulation results, a proof of concept of the manipulation of one passive element with two real Roombots meta-modules is described.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a framework for collaborative localization and mapping with multiple Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in unknown environments. Each MAV estimates its motion individually using an onboard, monocular visual odometry algorithm. The system of MAVs acts as a distributed preprocessor that streams only features of selected keyframes and relative-pose estimates to a centralized ground station. The ground station creates an individual map for each MAV and merges them together whenever it detects overlaps. This allows the MAVs to express their position in a common, global coordinate frame. The key to real-time performance is the design of data-structures and processes that allow multiple threads to concurrently read and modify the same map. The presented framework is tested in both indoor and outdoor environments with up to three MAVs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on real-time collaborative monocular SLAM, which has also been applied to MAVs.",

In this work, recognition, exploration, and planning methods are extended and combined in a single scene exploration system, enabling advanced techniques such as multi-view recognition from planned view positions and iterative recognition by integration of new objects from a scene. Here, a geometry based approach is used for recognition, i.e. matching objects from a database. Unknown objects are autonomously modeled and added to the recognition database. Next-Best-View planning is performed both for recognition and modeling. Moreover, 3D measurements are merged in a Probabilistic Voxel Space, which is utilized for planning collision free paths, minimal occlusion views, and verifying the poses of the recognized objects against all previous information. Experiments on an industrial robot with attached 3D sensors are shown for scenes with household and industrial objects.",

        "abstract": "Robot grasping and manipulation relies mainly on two types of sensory data: vision and tactile sensing. Localisation and recognition of the object is typically done through vision alone, while tactile sensors are commonly used for grasp control. Vision performs reliably in uncluttered environments, but its performance may deteriorate when the object is occluded, which is often the case during a manipulation task, when the object is in-hand and the robot fingers stand between the camera and the object. This paper presents a method to use the robot's sense of touch to refine the knowledge of a manipulated object's pose from an initial estimate provided by vision. The objective is to find a transformation on the object's location that is coherent with the current proprioceptive and tactile sensory data. The method was tested with different object geometries and proposes applications where this method can be used to improve the overall performance of a robotic system. Experimental results show an improvement of around 70% on the estimate of the object's location when compared to using only vision.",

Cameras are used both for data acquisition and navigation. Additional sensors also play a role in the SLAM tasks (Simultaneously Localization and Mapping). The independent mobility of the robots/cameras leads to a situation in which the common field-of-view (FOV) of cameras changes continuously. The present paper addresses the task of acquiring and tracking the cameras FOVs. State-of-the-art FOV characterization techniques count feature points or do image segmentation. These methods are often not accurate or complex. We propose an adaptive common FOV detection method based on fuzzy plane clustering. The performance of the method is shown to be invariant under baseline scaling. An autonomous grouping algorithm is further proposed with respect to both distance of robots and overlapping FOV of cameras.",

Thus, using the conventional approach based on the straight endoscope and surgical tools, there are some limitations in inspection and treatment of the target legion of the maxillary sinus. To cope with such problems, a dual master-slave system is investigated in this work for general maxillary sinus surgery. Initially, the need for dual arm operation is explained. A compact design of two 4-DOF end-effector mechanisms for acquiring the endoscopic image and performing biopsy is introduced. Next, a dual master device to control the motions of the two end-effector mechanisms is employed and a motion scheduling algorithm for a proper master-slave control is also developed.

        "abstract": "Robot-assisted surgical procedures, such as Laser Phonomicrosurgery (LP), suffer from susceptibility to variation in surgeon skill and equipment characteristics. Ergonomic and human-centered approaches acquire increased importance in the design of surgeon-machine interfaces. This paper proposes a protocol for comparative evaluation of surgeon-machine interfaces based on two criteria: (i) the subjective evaluation of their usability using questionnaires, and (ii) the objective evaluation of their performance using an imaging-based feature extraction method. Two interfaces in LP, the traditional (\u201cAcuBlade\u201d) interface and the novel (\u201cVirtual Scalpel\u201d) interface, were evaluated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. A series of experimental trials were conducted using the interfaces in surgery-like tasks in a controlled environment. The subjective evaluation pointed to the superiority of the Virtual Scalpel interface (score: 83.06) in terms of confidence and ease of use, and learnability, over the AcuBlade interface (score: 65.56). The objective evaluation showed the Virtual Scalpel interface having an overall score (55.96) significantly superior to the AcuBlade (51.37). It is thus shown that the multidimensional evaluation approach allowed to clearly distinguish between levels of perceived usability and effective performance of surgeon-machine interfaces from a user-centered perspective.",

Two central counter-rotating coaxial propellers provide a major part of lift force, and three perimeter-mounted tiltable ducted fans are used to supplement the lift force, provide lateral forces and adjust its attitude. Different from traditional underactuated MAVs, the presence of the tilt-rotor mechanism, composed of three ducted fans and three servo motors, on the Omnicopter makes it over-actuated. The characteristic of over-actuation enables the Omnicopter's position dynamics to be decoupled from its attitude dynamics. Based on a complete description of its dynamic model derived using the Newton-Euler motion equations, we propose attitude and position controllers and control allocation for the Omnicopter MAV. Simulation and experimental results are shown to demonstrate its performance.",

        "abstract": "Bouncing, balancing and swinging the leg forward can be considered as three basic control tasks for bipedal locomotion. Defining the trunk by an unstable inverted pendulum, balancing as being translated to trunk stabilization is the main focus of this paper. The control strategy is to generate a hip torque to have upright trunk to achieve robust hopping and running. It relies on the Virtual Pendulum (VP) concept which is recently proposed for trunk stabilization, based on human/animal locomotion analysis. Based on this concept, a control approach, named Virtual Pendulum Posture control (VPPC) is presented, in which the trunk is stabilized by redirecting the ground reaction force to a virtual support point. The required torques patterns generated by the controller, could partially be exerted by elastic structures like hip springs. Hybrid Zero Dynamics (HZD) control approach is also applied as an exact method of keeping the trunk upright. Stability of the motion which is investigated by Poincar\u00e9 map analysis could be achieved by hip springs, VPPC and HZD. The results show that hip springs, revealing muscle properties, could facilitate trunk stabilization. Compliance in hip produces acceptable performance and robustness compared with VPPC and HZD, while it is a passive structure.",

Representations of dynamic environments have recently received an increasing amount of attention in the research community. Understanding dynamic environments is seen as one of the key challenges in order to enable autonomous navigation in real-world scenarios. However, representing the temporal dimension is a challenge yet to be solved. In this paper we introduce a spatial representation, which encapsulates the statistical dynamic behavior observed in the environment. The proposed Conditional Transition Map (CTMap) is a grid-based representation that associates a probability distribution for an object exiting the cell, given its entry direction. The transition parameters are learned from a temporal signal of occupancy on cells by using a local-neighborhood cross-correlation method. In this paper, we introduce the CTMap, the learning approach and present a proof-of-concept method for estimating future paths of dynamic objects, called Conditional Probability Propagation Tree (CPPTree). The evaluation is done using a real-world dataset collected at a busy roundabout.",

The mechanism, which has two revolute joints and one prismatic joint, is designed to maintain a stationary point at the apex of the conical shape. By aligning the stationary point with the incision area, the mechanism allows a surgical instrument to explore the abdominal area through a small incision point. We have previously analyzed the reachable workspace of this mechanism. Here, we arrange two RCM mechanisms on a single conical structure but separated in space to avoid mutual interference, so as to enable the entire system to manipulate two surgical instruments through a single incision point without colliding. We describe the operational principle of this system, in addition to comparisons of various RCM mechanisms and the kinematics for parameter design and motion control. Finally, we describe preliminary experiments on peg transfer and suture motion by using the proposed RCM mechanism.",

A link may be deleted if distributed decision making determines that the edge is not a cut-bridge. A controller is presented which allows edges to be broken in a continuous manner without higher-level decision making. The controller is based on maximization of the second smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian. The controllers are designed for holonomic robots, and are extended for implementation on non-holonomic wheeled mobile robots. Finally, the performance of the extended controllers are demonstrated experimentally.",

        "abstract": "Probabilistic Roadmap Methods (PRMs) have been shown to work well at solving high Degree of Freedom (DoF) motion planning problems. They work by constructing a roadmap that approximates the topology of collision-free configuration space. However, this requires an accurate model of the robot's workspace in order to test if a sampled configuration is in collision or not. In this paper, we present a method for roadmap construction that can be used in workspaces with uncertainties in the model. For example, these can be inaccuracies that are caused by sensor error when an environment model was constructed. The uncertainty is encoded into the roadmap directly through the incorporation of non-binary collision detection values, e.g., a probability of collision. We refer to this new roadmap as a Safety-PRM because it allows tunability between the expected safety of the robot and the distance along a path. We compare the computational cost of Safety-PRM against two planning methods for environments without modeling errors, basic PRM and Medial Axis PRM (MAPRM), known for low computational cost and maximizing clearance, respectively. We demonstrate that in most cases, Safety-PRM produces high quality paths maximized for clearance and safety with the least amount of computational cost. We show that these paths are tunable for both robot safety and clearance. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of Safety-PRM on an experimental system, a Barrett Whole Arm Manipulator (WAM). On the WAM, we demonstrate the mapping of expected collision to robot speeds to enable the robot to physically test the safety of the roadmap and use torque estimation to make roadmap modifications.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Autonomous navigation in obstacle-dense indoor environments is very challenging for flying robots due to the high risk of collisions, which may lead to mechanical damage of the platform and eventual failure of the mission. While conventional approaches in autonomous navigation favor obstacle avoidance strategies, recent work showed that collision-robust flying robots could hit obstacles without breaking and even self-recover after a crash to the ground. This approach is particularly interesting for autonomous navigation in complex environments where collisions are unavoidable, or for reducing the sensing and control complexity involved in obstacle avoidance. This paper aims at showing that collision-robust platforms can go a step further and exploit contacts with the environment to achieve useful navigation tasks based on the sense of touch. This approach is typically useful when weight restrictions prevent the use of heavier sensors, or as a low-level detection mechanism supplementing other sensing modalities. In this paper, a solution based on force and inertial sensors used to detect obstacles all around the robot is presented. Eight miniature force sensors, weighting 0.9g each, are integrated in the structure of a collision-robust flying platform without affecting its robustness. A proof-of-concept experiment demonstrates the use of contact sensing for exploring autonomously a room in 3D, showing significant advantages compared to a previous strategy. To our knowledge this is the first fully autonomous flying robot using touch sensors as only exteroceptive sensors.",

We take advantage of the semantic knowledge of a human co-worker who provides additional context information and interacts with the robot through a user interface. A Bayesian Network encodes the dependencies between this information provided by the user. The output of this model generates a ranked list of grasp poses best suitable for a given task which is then passed to the motion planner. Our system was implemented in ROS and tested on a PR2 robot. We compared the system to state-of-the-art implementations using quantitative (e.g. success rate, execution times) as well as qualitative (e.g. user convenience, cognitive load) metrics. We conducted a user study in which eight subjects were asked to perform a generic manipulation task, for instance to pour a bottle or move a cereal box, with a set of state-of-the-art shared autonomy interfaces. Our results indicate that an interface which is aware of the context provides benefits not currently provided by other state-of-the-art implementations.",

        "abstract": "A major problem for the application of sensori-motor approaches to robot control is the classification of states. The typically immense sizes of sensorimotor state spaces render it very unlikely that exactly the same states are visited by the robot several times. In order to learn about the consequences of alternative behaviors in these states, a classification of similar or related states is necessary. This requires a metric to measure similarity between states. Under the premise that the robot should maximize its fitness, we studied the correlations between sensory data in different modalities and fitness values. We found that this correlation structure can serve as a context-dependent weighting of the importance of individual sensory channels that allows to define such a metric. In a collision-avoidance scenario we demonstrate that this results in (i) faster learning of successful actions, (ii) an acquired differentiation between sensory modalities, (iii) the possibility to use the full sensors resolution without quantization or compression, and (iv) a means to enhance sensor failure resilience.",

To achieve such capabilities, we propose a Labeled Multi-modal Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LM-LDA), which is a generative classifier trained with two different data cues, for instance, one cue can be traditional visual observation and another cue can be contextual information. The novel aspects of the LM-LDA classifier, compared to other methods for encoding contextual information are that, I) even with only one of the cues present at execution time, the classification will be better than single cue classification since cue correlations are encoded in the model, II) one of the cues (e.g., common grasps for the observed object class) can be inferred from the other cue (e.g., the appearance of the observed object). This makes the method suitable for robot online and transfer learning; a capability highly desirable in cognitive robotic applications. Our experiments show a clear improvement for classification and a reasonable inference of the missing data.",

Although Gaussian processes have been successfully applied to map building, the applications are limited to small-scale environments due to the high computational complexity. To improve the scalability, we adopt a divide and conquer strategy where data are partitioned into manageable size of clusters and local Gaussian processes are applied to each cluster. Particularly, we propose overlapping clusters to mitigate the discontinuity problem that predictions of local estimators do not match along the boundaries. The results are consistent and continuous occupancy voxel maps in a fully Bayesian framework. We evaluate our method with simulated data and compare map accuracy and computational time with previous work. We also demonstrate our method with real data acquired from a laser range finder.",

Based on our previous work with tetraplegic individuals, we investigate the use of low-cost yet stable surface Electromyography (sEMG) interfaces for individuals with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), a disease leading to the death of neuronal cells in the anterior horn of the spinal cord; with sEMG, we can record remaining active muscle fibers. We show the ability of two individuals with SMA to actively control a robot in 3.5D continuously decoded through sEMG after a few minutes of training, allowing them to regain some independence in daily life. Although movement is not nearly as fast as natural, unimpaired movement, reach and grasp success rates are near 100% after 50s of movement.",

        "abstract": "This paper is about estimating a smooth, continuous-time trajectory of a vehicle relative to a prior 3D laser map. We pose the estimation problem as that of finding a sequence of Catmull-Rom splines which optimise the Kernelised R\u00e9nyi Distance (KRD) between the prior map and live measurements from a 3D laser sensor. Our approach treats the laser measurements as a continual stream of data from a smoothly moving vehicle. We side-step entirely the segmentation and feature matching problems incumbent in traditional point cloud matching algorithms, relying instead on a smooth and well behaved objective function. Importantly our approach admits the exploitation of sensors with modest sampling rates - sensors that take seconds to densely sample the workspace. We show how by appropriate use of the Improved Fast Gauss Transform we can reduce the order of the estimation problem from quadratic (straight forward application of the KRD) to linear. Although in this paper we use 3D laser, our approach is also applicable to vehicles using 2D laser sensing or dense stereo. We demonstrate and evaluate the performance of our approach when estimating the full 6DOF continuous time pose of a road vehicle undertaking over 2.7km of outdoor travel.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new set of approaches for teleoperation of mobile manipulators with on-board cameras. Mobile manipulators consist of a robotic arm which provides for interaction and manipulation, and a mobile base which extends the workspace of the arm. While the position of the onboard camera is determined by the base motion, the principal control objective is the motion of the manipulator arm. This calls for intelligent control allocation between the base and the manipulator arm in order to obtain intuitive control of both the camera and the arm. We implement virtual mass-spring-damper forces between the end-effector and the camera so that the camera follows the end-effector with an overdamped characteristics. The operator therefore only needs to control the end-effector motion, while the vehicle with the camera will follow naturally. The operator is thus able to control the more than six degrees of freedom of the vehicle and manipulator through a standard haptic device. The control allocation problem, i.e., whether the vehicle or manipulator arm actuation is applied, is then performed automatically so that the operator can concentrate on the manipulator motion.",

        "abstract": "This paper offers a method to compute the control inputs for an all-wheel drive vehicle that moves along a specified path on rough terrain. The focus of this paper is on longitudinal motion only, using a half-car model with no suspensions. For a given path, we first compute the range of the admissible speeds and accelerations at every point along the path, subject to vehicle dynamics and constraints on the wheel/ground forces. A feasible velocity profile along the path is then computed to respect the admissible speeds and accelerations and satisfy given boundary conditions. While the velocity profile represents the accelerations of the center of mass, it remains to determine the control inputs (torques) for the two independent wheels. The challenge stems from the longitudinal model being an indeterminate system, having two control inputs but only one degree-of-freedom along the specified path. This inherent indeterminacy is resolved by adding a virtual suspension to the rigid vehicle model, which allows to explicitly compute the two individual wheel torques. The method is demonstrated for a vehicle moving at the time optimal speeds over a bump. A dynamic simulation of the vehicle with a stiff suspension shows that the two wheels maintain contact with the ground at all times, despite moving at the ultimate speeds. It is also shown that the all-wheel-drive model produces a larger set of admissible speeds and accelerations, and hence results in faster speeds and shorter motion times than the single drive (front or rear) model.",

Unit quaternions are used to describe the end-effectors' orientation since they exhibit the well known property of being a singularity-free representation. The proposed controller does not need the measurement of the velocities, instead a passivity-based filter is used. Under the reasonable assumptions that the human operator and the environment define passive maps from force to velocity, it is proved that velocities and pose (position and orientation) errors between the local and the remote manipulators are bounded. Moreover, in the case that the human and the environment forces are zero, the velocities and pose errors converge asymptotically to zero. Finally, experimental validation using two robots of 6-Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) shows the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.",

Magnetic nanoparticles is added into the alginic acid sodium solution to append magnetic material inside the fibers. The magnetic material inside the hydrogel fiber is regulated by the microfluidic device. Magnetic tweezers system based on solenoid electromagnet is utilized to evaluate the magnetic response of the magnetic hydrogel fiber.

Contact surface engineering has been recently proposed as a possible mean to introduce dexterity in simple grippers, as in the Velvet Fingers smart gripper, a novel concept of end-effector combining simple under-actuated mechanics and high manipulation possibilities, thanks to conveyors which are built in the finger pads. This paper undergoes the modeling and control of the active conveyors of the Velvet Fingers gripper which are rendered able to emulate different levels of friction and to apply tangential thrusts to the contacted objects. Through the paper particular attention is dedicated to the mechanical implementation, sense drive and control electronics of the device. The capabilities of the prototype are showed in some grasping and manipulation experiments.",

        "abstract": "Cooperation1 is at the core of human social life. In this context, two major challenges face research on humanrobot interaction: the first is to understand the underlying structure of cooperation, and the second is to build, based on this understanding, artificial agents that can successfully and safely interact with humans. Here we take a psychologically grounded and human-centered approach that addresses these two challenges. We test the hypothesis that optimal cooperation between a na\u00efve human and a robot requires that the robot can acquire and execute a joint plan, and that it communicates this joint plan through ecologically valid modalities including spoken language, gesture and gaze. We developed a cognitive system that comprises the human-like control of social actions, the ability to acquire and express shared plans and a spoken language stage. In order to test the psychological validity of our approach we tested 12 na\u00efve subjects in a cooperative task with the robot. We experimentally manipulated the presence of a joint plan (vs. a solo plan), the use of task-oriented gaze and gestures, and the use of language accompanying the unfolding plan. The quality of cooperation was analyzed in terms of proper turn taking, collisions and cognitive errors. Results showed that while successful turn taking could take place in the absence of the explicit use of a joint plan, its presence yielded significantly greater success. One advantage of the solo plan was that the robot would always be ready to generate actions, and could thus adapt if the human intervened at the wrong time, whereas in the joint plan the robot expected the human to take his/her turn. Interestingly, when the robot represented the action as involving a joint plan, gaze provided a highly potent nonverbal cue that facilitated successful collaboration and reduced errors in the absence of verbal communication. These results support the cooperative stance in human social cognition, and suggest that cooper... Show More",

        "abstract": "In this paper we consider the problem of coordinating the motion of the manipulator and the vehicle to produce stable trajectories for the combined mobile manipulator system on uneven terrain. These kinds of situations often arise in planetary exploration, where rovers equipped with a manipulator are required to navigate over general uneven terrain. Moreover the framework can also be used in situations where the mobile manipulator is required to transport objects on uneven terrain. We generate feasible trajectories for the vehicle between a given start and a goal point considering the dynamics of the manipulator. The framework proposed in the paper plans such motion profile of the manipulator that maximizes vehicle stability which is measured by a novel concept called Feasible Acceleration Count (FAC). We show that, from the point of view of motion planning of mobile manipulator on uneven terrains, FAC gives a better estimate of vehicle stability than more popular metrics like Tip-Over Stability. The trajectory planner closely resembles motion primitive based graph based planning and is combined with a novel cost function derived from FAC. The efficacy of the approach is shown through simulations of a mobile manipulator system on a 2.5D uneven terrain.",

We focus on a corridor following task where no prior knowledge of the environment is required. Our approach embeds an image-based controller, thus avoiding to estimate the pose of the wheelchair. The servoing process matches the non holonomous constraints of the wheelchair and relies on two visual features, namely the vanishing point location and the orientation of the median line formed by the straight lines related to the bottom of the walls. This overcomes the process initialization issue typically raised in the literature. The control scheme has been implemented onto a robotized wheelchair and results show that it can follow a corridor with an accuracy of \u00b13cm.",

The sound intensities radiated by the objects are estimated by combining the sound intensity at the platform's position (estimated with a steered response power algorithm) and the distances to the objects (estimated using laser range finders). By combining the estimated sound intensity at the platform's position with the platform's pose obtained from a particle filter based localization algorithm, the sound intensity radiated from the objects is registered in the cells of a grid map covering the environment. This procedure creates a map of the radiated sound intensity that contains information about the sound directivity. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a map of radiated sound intensity is created for a test environment. Then the position and the directivity of the sound sources in the test environment are estimated from this map.",

        "abstract": "Finding an optimal path for a redundant robotic system to visit a sequence of several goal placements poses two technical challenges. First, while searching for an optimal sequence, infinitely many feasible configurations can be used to reach each goal placement. Second, obstacle avoidance has to be considered while optimizing the path from one goal placement to the next. Previous works focused on solving a discrete formulation of this optimization problem where only few configurations are used to represent each goal placement. We instead model it as a Traveling Salesman Problem with Neighborhoods (TSPN), where each neighborhood is defined as the set of the infinitely many configurations corresponding to the same goal placement. A solution procedure based on a Hybrid Random-key Genetic Algorithm (HRKGA) and bidirectional Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (biRRTs) is then proposed. Finally, experimental tests performed on a 7-Degree Of Freedom (DOF) industrial vision inspection system show that the proposed method is able to drastically reduce the cycle time currently required by the system.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A novel technique of dead reckoning for biped robots, which could be utilized for agile motion controls, is proposed. A complementary filter combines the estimations of the position of robot body from both the kinematic computation and the acceleration information, where the former is relied on in the lower frequency domain and the latter is done on in the higher domain. Even though the supporting foot of the robot happens to roll and rotate on the terrain, the estimation accuracy of the kinematics is improved by taking such movements into consideration. We suppose that the contact point moves with respect to the ground at the instantaneously minimum velocity, and thus name it the instantaneous minimum velocity point (IMVP), which is estimated by an optimization. IMVP can be computed for each foot, so that the weighted sum of them by the magnitude of reaction forces on each foot is adopted as a candidate of the contact point under an assumption that the contact condition is more steady when a larger reaction force is applied. Finally, it is merged with the twice-integrated acceleration through the complementary filter, where the crossover frequency is also determined by the reaction forces. Hence, it is robust against the change of contact conditions. Results of computer simulations will show that the proposed method reduces the estimation error comparing with the conventional methods.",

These typically strong visual features cause considerable change in the appearance of a place, and therefore confound vision-based localisation approaches. In this paper we describe how to convert a colour image of the scene to a greyscale invariant image where pixel values are a function of underlying material property not lighting. We summarise the theory of shadow invariant images and discuss the modelling and calibration issues which are important for non-ideal off-the-shelf colour cameras. We evaluate the technique with a commonly used robotic camera and an autonomous car operating in an outdoor environment, and show that it can outperform the use of ordinary greyscale images for the task of visual localisation.",

In this paper we consider the possibility of injecting external inputs into the networked system, in order to obtain more complex cooperative behaviors. Specifically, we introduce a strategy that makes it possible to control the overall state of the networked system by directly controlling only a subset of the networked agents, namely the leaders. Exploiting local interaction rules, it is possible to define the inputs for the leaders in such a way that each follower is forced to track a desired periodic setpoint.",

We propose the decentralization of the pebble game algorithm of Jacobs et. al., an O(n2) method that determines the generic rigidity of a planar network. Our decentralization is based on asynchronous inter-agent message-passing and a distributed memory architecture, coupled with consensus-based auctions for electing leaders in the system. We provide analysis of the asynchronous messaging structure and its interaction with leader election, and Monte Carlo simulations demonstrating complexity and correctness. Finally, a novel rigidity evaluation and control scenario in the accompanying media illustrates the applicability of our proposed algorithm.",

In this paper we introduce a new algorithm that extends our prior result to incorporate the duration of each assembly operation. We also extend the algorithm to be adaptive to the availability of parts. When a part is not available, the assembly sequence is recomputed. The algorithms are provably convergent and their execution does not depend on the size of the robot team. We implement the algorithms using a team of four youBot robots that can (1) locate and identify parts; (2) use communication to achieve coordinated hand-off of parts; and (3) create complex log-cabin style structures.",

In this paper, we present a system that enables robots to use CAD models of objects as a knowledge source and to perform logical inference about object components that have automatically been identified in these models. The system includes several algorithms for mesh segmentation and geometric primitive fitting which are integrated into the robot's knowledge base as procedural attachments to the semantic representation. Bottom-up segmentation methods are complemented by top-down, knowledge-based analysis of the identified components. The evaluation on a diverse set of object models, downloaded from the Internet, shows that the algorithms are able to reliably detect several kinds of object parts.",

Direct methods refer to intensity-based nonmetric techniques to perform that stabilization. Intensity-based strategies provide for higher accuracy, whereas not requiring any metric information improves their versatility. However, existing direct techniques either have a coupled error dynamics, or are designed for planar objects only. This paper proposes a new direct technique that decouples the translational motion from the rotational one for the general case of both planar and nonplanar targets under general translational and rotational displacements. Furthermore, for the important case of a fronto-parallel planar object, the proposed technique leads to a fully diagonal interaction matrix. The equilibrium state is made locally exponentially stable for all those cases. These improvements are theoretically proven and experimentally demonstrated using a 6-DoF robotic arm.",

Central to this work is the use of an \u201cas-rigid-as-possible\u201d space deformation for efficient dense map correction in a pose graph optimisation framework. By combining pose graph optimisation with non-rigid deformation of a dense map we are able to obtain highly accurate dense maps over large scale trajectories that are both locally and globally consistent. With low latency in mind we derive an incremental method for deformation graph construction, allowing multi-million point maps to be captured over hundreds of metres in real-time. We provide benchmark results on a well established RGB-D SLAM dataset demonstrating the accuracy of the system and also provide a number of our own datasets which cover a wide range of environments, both indoors, outdoors and across multiple floors.",

        "abstract": "A deformation-tracking impedance control strategy is discussed for applications where a manipulator interacts with environments of unknown geometrical and mechanical properties, especially with stiffness comparable to a controlled robot stiffness. Based on force-tracking impedance controls, the deformation-tracking strategy allows the control of a desired deformation of the target environment, requiring the on-line estimation of the environment stiffness. An Extended Kalman Filter is used for the estimation of the environment because of measurement uncertainties and errors in compound interaction model. The tasks presented involve full body spatial interactions with a time-varying environment stiffness. The Extended Kalman Filter and the deformation-tracking impedance control are validated in simulation and with experiments. In particular, a cooperative assembly task is also performed with a human operator acting as varying environment, i.e. unpredictably changing the handling arm stiffness.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a gripper with fingertips constructed from incompressible fluid covered by rubber with the aim of grasping very fragile objects. Owing to the incom-pressibility, simply closing the gripper allows the fingertips to approach the target object with low stiffness; after contact, the contact stiffness increases with increasing fingertip deformation, and grasping with high stiffness can be realized. The adaptation of the fingertips to the object shape and a uniform contact pressure are further benefits of the proposed system. Fragile and brittle objects can be grasped by controlling the contact pressure so that it does not exceed the fracture stress/pressure. We found that the initial sign of fracture appears before total fracture when soft and ductile objects are grasped. Based on this phenomenon, we developed a strategy for grasping ductile objects without any advance knowledge of fracture. The proposed fingertips have a rigid layer inside the fluid to grasp objects with normal rigidity. The effectiveness of the fingertips was confirmed experimentally.",

In contrast to sparse, feature-based methods, this allows us to better exploit the available information in the image data which leads to higher pose accuracy. Furthermore, we propose an entropy-based similarity measure for keyframe selection and loop closure detection. From all successful matches, we build up a graph that we optimize using the g2o framework. We evaluated our approach extensively on publicly available benchmark datasets, and found that it performs well in scenes with low texture as well as low structure. In direct comparison to several state-of-the-art methods, our approach yields a significantly lower trajectory error. We release our software as open-source.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The acoustical dynamics of reverberation in an enclosed environment poses a problem to human-robot communication. Any change in the azimuthal orientation of the speaker contributes to unpredictable acoustical activity resulting in a degradation in the performance of the automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. Thus, dereverberation techniques need to address this issue prior to ASR. Dereverberation in multi-channel applications primarily evolves in the adoption of a suitable reverberant model that results to a computationally feasible solution and at the same time yields an accurate estimate of the harmful reflections (i.e., late reflection) for effective suppression. In this paper we address this problem by introducing a hybrid method based on multi-channel processing on a singlechannel reverberant model platform. The proposed method is capable of accurate signal estimation, a property inherent to a multi-channel system, and at the same time bears the computational efficiency derived from single-channel reverberant model approach. The proposed method is summarized as follows; First, multi-channel sound-source processing is employed to obtain the full reverberant and the late reflection signal estimates. Then, equalization is employed to update the late reflection estimate reflective of the change in azimuth prior to dereverberation. The equalization parameters for azimuthal change are obtained through an offline optimization procedure. Experimental evaluation in an actual human-robot communication environment shows that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness in the ASR performance.",

We propose a method to describe and uniformly execute various object manipulations by a humanoid robot. In description, we focus on the contact states and define manipulation phases according to the contact states. In execution, the humanoid's controller autonomously switches manipulation phases and substantiates the contact-force controller. According to switching of the manipulation phases, the humanoid's manipulation system switches the inputs for the contact-force controller, which includes the estimation of object's information and motion generation. We evaluated our proposed system through experiments in which the HRP-2 robot manipulates four objects without information about the objects' masses and necessary operational forces.",

Four tetrahedrally-arranged actuation units (AU) are mounted on the hull for locomotion, with each AU having a thruster which can be rotated around a radial axis through the sphere center. This design provides redundant control in the six degrees of freedom of motion, and Skye is able to move omnidirectionally and to rotate around any axis. A multi-camera module is also mounted on the hull for capture of aerial imagery or live video stream according to an \u2018eyeball\u2019 concept \u2014 the camera module is not itself actuated, but the whole blimp is rotated in order to obtain a desired camera view. Skye is safe for use near people \u2014 the double hull minimizes the likelihood of rupture on an unwanted collision; the propellers are covered by grills to prevent accidental contact; and the blimp is near neutral buoyancy so that it makes only a light impact on contact and can be readily nudged away. The system is portable and deployable by a single operator \u2014 the electronics, AUs, and camera unit are mounted externally and are detachable from the hull during transport; operator control is via an intuitive touchpad interface. The motivating application is in entertainment robotics. Skye has a varied motion vocabulary such as swooping and bobbing, plus internal LEDs for visual effect. Computer vision enables interaction with an audience. Experimental results show dexterous maneuvers in indoor and outdoor environments, and non-dangerous impacts between the blimp and humans.",

Due to their series elasticity, the integrated joints may minimize large forces which occur during accidental impacts and, further, may offer more accurate and stable force control and a capacity for energy storage. Then, human expert's fingertip force curve in the process of massage therapy is acquired in vivo by a dedicated measurement device. Three massage techniques, pressing, kneading and plucking, are implemented by the soft arm, respectively, on torso model in vitro and on human body in vivo. Experimental results show that the developed robotic arm can effectively imitates the TCM remedial massage techniques.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel and mechanically decoupled leg and wheel hybrid transformable robot called HyTRo-I that combines two mobility concepts. For example, while wheeled vehicles shares higher speed than legged and tracked machines on a flat ground, they have relatively lower degree of flexibility than the other two on irregular terrain. The HyTRo-I robot evolves three motion modes: wheeled rolling, quadrupedal walking and leg-wheel hybrid mode. Despite the over-whelming complexity of obstacles, only several typical obstacles are selected for the study, which are stairs, large protrusions and ditches. Firstly, the transition locomotion mechanism between wheeled rolling mode and quadrupedal walking mode should be studied in detail. In the course of reciprocal transition locomotion, the static and reversible transformation gait not only guarantees the shifting stability and a small number of transition steps, but also the relatively balanced torque of joints. Secondly, after HyTRo-I converting to effective locomotion mode, the adaptive gait control strategies are proposed to traverse three types of obstacles. Finally, a serial of experiments were performed to verify the validity of the proposed transformation gait and adaptive step-up gaits.",

        "abstract": "Insect-scale legged robots have the potential to locomote on rough terrain, crawl through confined spaces, and scale vertical and inverted surfaces. However, small scale implies that such robots are unable to carry large payloads. Limited payload capacity forces miniature robots to utilize simple control methods that can be implemented on a simple onboard microprocessor. In this study, the design of a new version of the biologically-inspired Harvard Ambulatory MicroRobot (HAMR) is presented. In order to find the most suitable control inputs for HAMR, maneuverability experiments are conducted for several drive parameters. Ideal input candidates for orientation and lateral velocity control are identified as a result of the maneuverability experiments. Using these control inputs, two simple feedback controllers are implemented to control the orientation and the lateral velocity of the robot. The controllers are used to force the robot to track trajectories with a minimum turning radius of 55 mm and a maximum lateral to normal velocity ratio of 0.8. Due to their simplicity, the controllers presented in this work are ideal for implementation with on-board computation for future HAMR prototypes.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Nonlinear elasticity of transmission is indispensable in any passively variable stiffness mechanism. However, it remains obscure how to decide a desired nonlinear force-displacement function. On the other hand biological muscular actions are associated with stiffness/impedance variation in a wide range as demanded by everyday tasks. This paper addresses the issue of designing a nonlinear elastic transmission, where the elastic behaviour is obtained from the passive properties of biological muscle, which happens to be an exponential one, leading to existence of linearity between stiffness and force. In general, with passive damping, the transmission behaves as a mechanical impedance element, to be used in variable impedance actuation. Knowledge of the varying impedance is required to operate the transmission reliably. An off-line calibrated model can only be approximate and erroneous with noisy sensors and changing characteristics of the passive elements with time and environmental condition. This article implements an Extended Kalman Filter algorithm for on-line estimation of stiffness and impedance of such a damped series-elastic transmission. The underlined principle in stiffness-force affine relation is exploited favourably in stiffness estimation with reduced complexity. The effectiveness of the proposed estimator is examined through experiments on the mechanical transmission designed using the biological principle.",

In this paper, we extend the feedback excitation control to systems that are affected by gravity, and we analyze the feedback excitation control system from the viewpoint of linear vibration mode. Validity of the proposed `coordinate or opposite phase controller' is suggested by the modal analysis.

Retinal cannulation appears to be the most effective treatment, but given the small diameter of a retinal vein, it is too difficult and risky for a surgeon to perform this procedure manually. This work reports on the development of an innovative robotic manipulator to assist vitreoretinal surgeons during this procedure using a co-manipulation control strategy. The robotic manipulator features a new Remote-Center-of-Motion mechanism with four degrees of freedom. This mechanism is particularly interesting for applications in minimally invasive surgery where an instrument needs to be manoeuvred in a highly confined space around a fixed incision point. The developed manipulator is shown to be a great asset in improving the quality of retinal cannulations compared to the manual procedure. This is shown by cannulation experiments performed on a custom made eye model and an injectable retina model that effectively simulate real retinal cannulations.",

        "abstract": "MRI-guided percutaneous liver interventions have been investigated by researchers as an alternative to CT-guided procedures as it is non-invasive and provides greater soft tissue details. In practice, however, repeated needle insertion is still required to reach desired positions on trial-and-error basis. To minimize the needle attempt and procedural time, we designed a robotic needle guidance device that provides needle insertion angle guidance at skin entry using two rotational joints structured for remote-center-of-motion manipulation. To evaluate the mechanism and clinical feasibility, we fabricated a proof-of-concept prototype that can be manually operated. As preliminary design evaluation, we conducted a retrospective clinical study of 13 MRI-guided abdominal biopsies to determine if the proposed mechanism and device can provide necessary needle insertion angles in MRI-guided liver biopsy procedures. The number of needle insertion attempts per biopsy was also measured. To confirm the kinematic design of the double ring remote-center-of-motion mechanism and to identify any procedural difficulties, we conducted a phantom targeting experiment. The retrospective clinical study showed that the 80 degree insertion angle coverage of the device is sufficient for clinical cases, and an average of five needle insertion attempts per biopsy in conventional MRI-guided biopsy can be reduced by the proposed device. A phantom targeting experiment confirmed that the unique kinematic design was successfully implementation in the targeting.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel compliant differential (CD) Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuator with improved performance compared to traditional SMA actuators. This actuator is composed of two antagonistic SMA wires and a mechanical joint coupled with a torsion spring. The torsion spring is employed to reduce the total stiffness of SMA actuator and improve the range of motion. The antagonistic wires increase the response time as one wire can be heated up while the other wire is still in the cooling process. Dynamic model of this actuator was established for control design. Experimental results proved that this new actuator can provide larger output range of motion and faster response speed than traditional SMA actuators under the same conditions. Sine wave tracking with 0.05 Hz, 0.08 Hz and 0.1 Hz were performed and our results demonstrated that this compliant actuator has good tracking performance under simple PID control.",

A Linear Delta manipulator is a suitable tremor suppression device due to the simple structure and high stiffness with the vertical direction in the application of micro manipulation such as microsurgery and cell manipulation. In order to implement the mechanism of the Linear Delta manipulator to the device, three voice coil motors and three linear encoders with high resolution were used. The flexure mechanism was applied to the device to avoid the friction effect of the small ball joint. Finally, the experiments for the validation of the proposed device were performed as follows: (1) position control in each axis for accuracy, and (2) sine wave tracking (500 \u03bcm, 12Hz) for bandwidth of the system.",

The open-loop stability is crucial especially in passively counter-balanced mechanisms where no actuators are involved. Passive hands-on device is such an example. A general stiffness model is derived for general closed-chain mechanism including counter-weight model. As a measure of the open-loop stability, we employ the determinant of the stiffness matrix. A parallel mechanism having 3 translational DOF (degree of freedom) is employed as an exemplary device. An antagonistically counter-balancing is found the most stable method.

The robot has a total of 14 joints; among them six flexion/extension joints are powered. Pneumatic artificial muscles are combined with small high-response servo motors for the hip and knee joints, and arranged antagonistically at the hip and ankle joints to provide passive stability and variable stiffness. The preliminary experimental results on position and torque control demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms, sensors and control systems are effective, and hybrid drive is promising for torque-controllable, high-speed, backdrivable, mobile (but non-power-autonomous) exoskeleton robots.",

Moreover, it is shown that the proposed method preserves the passivity of the impedance controllers. The proposed method can be applied to various types of impedance controllers in a unified way.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study the design of omnidirectional mobile robots with Active-Caster RObotic drive with BAll Transmission (ACROBAT). ACROBAT system has been developed by the authors group which realizes mechanical coordination of wheel and steering motions for creating caster behaviors without computer calculations. A motion in the specific direction relative to a robot body is fully depends on the motion of a specific motor. This feature gives a robot designer to build an omnidirectional mobile robot propelled by active-casters with no redundant actuation with a simple control. A controller of the robot becomes as simple as that for omni-wheeled robotic bases. Namely 3DOF of the omnidirectional robot is controlled by three motors using a simple and constant kinematics. ACROBAT includes a unique dual-ball transmission to transmit traction power to rotate and orient a drive wheel with distributing velocity components to wheel and steering axes in an appropriate ratio. Therefore a sensor for measuring a wheel orientation and calculations for velocity distributions are totally removed from a conventional control system. To build an omnidirectional vehicle by ACROBAT, the significant feature is some multiple drive shafts can be driven by a common motor which realizes non-redundant actuation of the robotic platform. A kinematic model of the proposed robot with ACROBAT is analyzed and a mechanical condition for realizing a non-redundant actuation is derived. Based on the kinematic model and the mechanical condition, computer simulations of the mechanism are performed. A prototype two-wheeled robot with two ACROBATs is designed and built to verify the availability of the proposed system. In the experiments, the prototype robot shows successful omnidirectional motions with a simple and constant kinematics based control.",

We examine the system's unobservable directions for two common hovering conditions (with and without rotational motion) and propose a robust motion-classification algorithm, based on both visual and inertial measurements. By leveraging our observability analysis and the proposed motion classifier, we modify existing state-of-the-art filtering algorithms, so as to ensure that the number of the system's unobservable directions is minimized. Finally, we validate experimentally the proposed modified sliding window filter, by demonstrating its robustness on a quadrotor with rapid transitions between hovering and forward motions, within an indoor environment.",

The proposed approach utilities optimization to extract a model from joint trajectories under normal operation and seek to identify anomalous behaviors that deviates significantly from the known model. Compared to previously proposed approaches in humanoid anomaly detection that identified only high-level faults, our approach can detect subtle defects in the robot and at the same time, is capable of generalizing to higher-level behaviors. The system is demonstrated on a simulated model of the Atlas humanoid robot, with several experimental scenarios demonstrating detection of both joint-level anomalies and behaviors such as falling.",

        "abstract": "Monitoring and estimation of marine populations is of paramount importance for the conservation and management of sea species. Regular surveys are used to this purpose followed often by a manual counting process. This paper proposes an algorithm for automatic detection of dugongs from imagery taken in aerial surveys. Our algorithm exploits the fact that dugongs are rare in most images, therefore we determine regions of interest partially based on color rarity. This simple observation makes the system robust to changes in illumination. We also show that by applying the extended-maxima transform on red-ratio images, submerged dugongs with very fuzzy edges can be detected. Performance figures obtained here are promising in terms of degree of confidence in the detection of marine species, but more importantly our approach represents a significant step in automating this type of surveys.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a new method to detumble a malfunctioning satellite. Large space debris such as malfunctioning satellites generally rotates with nutational motion. Thus several researches have proposed the methods to use a space robot for capturing and deorbiting these debris. The most of the past studies considered the method to detumble an uncontrollable satellite and then capture a single spinning satellite. However these methods require physical contact with malfunctioning satellites, which has a risk of accident. Therefore, we propose a method with an eddy current brake [1]. The eddy current brake system can produce braking force to the target without any physical contact. Thus, we can reduce the risk of critical collision between the space robot and the target object. This paper firstly reviews dynamics of a tumbling satellite and proposes a detumbling strategy with the eddy current brake. We carry out a fundamental experiment to evaluate the performance of the braking force of the developed eddy current brake system, and then we simulate detumbling operation by using the experimental data and show an effectiveness of the proposed detumbling method.",

They are used to perform tests of algorithms, for optimization and to analyze the system behavior in situations, which would be hazardous or difficult for the real robot. This paper addresses a simulation framework related to a wall-climbing robot using negative pressure adhesion in combination with an omnidirectional drive system. The key aspect of this simulation is the adhesion system consisting of simulated pressure sensors, valves between adhesion chambers and vacuum reservoir and a simulated adaptive sealing proofing the vacuum chambers towards ambient air. The interaction of environmental features (e. g. surface characteristics like roughness or special geometries) and the vacuum chambers of the robot is handled by a thermodynamic model providing the basis for airflow simulation between the virtual surface and the robot. These features facilitate the validation of control algorithms and closed-loop controllers in realtime.",

To develop long legs relative to body, special parallel link mechanism to drive leg joints powerfully and effectively is introduced to leg mechanism of ASURA I. First, we discuss design problems of leg mechanism in detail: leg length, DOF configuration, actuator selection and leg driving system. Then, analysis of kinematics, singularity and static characteristic of leg mechanism are reported. Finally, the prototype leg, which is 1.3 m in length and 3.2 kg in weight, has been developed and tested on some basic performance. The prototype successfully have demonstrated very basic motion.",

Then, we developed the new hand which paid its attention to the structure of human being's hand which realize operation in human-like manipulation (called TUAT/Karlsruhe Humanoid Hand). Since this humanoid hand has the structure of adjusting grasp shape and grasp force automatically, it does not need a touch sensor and feedback control. It is designed for the humanoid robot which has to work autonomously or interactively in cooperation with humans and for an artificial arm for handicapped persons. The ideal end-effectors for such an artificial arm or a humanoid would be able to use the tools and objects that a person uses when working in the same environment. If this humanoid hand can operate the same tools, a machine and furniture, it may be possible to work under the same environment as human beings. As a result of adopting a new function of a palm and the thumb, the robot hand could do the operation which was impossible until now. The humanoid hand realized operations which hold a kitchen knife, grasping a fan, a stick, uses the scissors and uses chopsticks.",

        "abstract": "Voice-coil actuators are the simplest form of electric motor consisting of a non-commutated single coil or winding moving through a fixed magnetic field produced by stationary permanent magnets. From a system design point of view, however, it is generally the end user's responsibility to couple the voice-coil actuator with a linear bearing system, position feedback device, switch-mode or linear servo amplifier, and motion controller. The integration of multiple discrete components adversely affects system reliability and renders minimization and packaging difficult particularly when multiple actuators are required. In response to this demand, a novel, low-inertia voice coil actuator has been developed whereby the traditional moving coil is replaced with a printed circuit board (PCB) that incorporates the necessary windings as conductive traces on one or more layers of the board. The result is a compact, highly integrated, highly reliable design that is simple to mass-produce using conventional PCB manufacturing and assembly techniques.",

Thus, we proposed a novel control strategy for gait rehabilitation of hemiplegic patients. The whole system consists of a Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) device and Treadmill-Walk system. FES contributes to improve the quality of the gait based on real-time adjustment of gait pattern. During gait, the electrical stimuli from separate output channels of an FES device are launched to stimulate two lower extremity muscles (Tibialis Anterior (TA) and Hamstrings). Stimulus launching procedure is based on identifying subject's gait state (stance and swing phases). According to the current variation of treadmill motor, gait phase and muscle activation of lower limbs can be determined during walking on Treadmill-Walk. Three able-bodied subjects simulated hemiplegic patients in the experiment. The results indicated that the proposed method is a safe, feasible and promising intervention.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the development of an inspection robot for use in 1-inch gas pipes. These pipes are commonly used in residences and between gas meters and a main pipe that is buried under the road, and they require regular inspection. However, appropriately advanced inspection technologies have not yet been developed. An endoscope, which is the current inspection method, can only be utilized in a limited inspection scenarios. As for robot inspection, current in-pipe robots cannot pass through a 90-degree elbow, which has a radius of curvature equal to its inside diameter (Rc = 1.0 ID). However these elbows are frequently encountered in real-life environments. In this study, to solve these problems, we developed a peristaltic crawling robot with pneumatic artificial muscles for use in 1-inch gas pipes. This robot can pass through a 90-degree elbow (Rc = 1.0 ID) in the horizontal and vertical planes. In addition, this robot can be equipped with an endoscope and take videos inside a pipe. However, has been unable to pass through continuous elbows, which are occasionally encountered. For use in real-life environments, a robot is needed that can pass through continuous elbows. In this paper, we report the development of a robot that can pass through continuous elbows.",

The safety devices consist of only mechanical components without actuators, controllers, or batteries. The safety device is attached to each drive-shaft of the robot. If the safety device detects an unexpected angular velocity of the drive-shaft, the safety device can switch off all motors of the robot and lock the drive-shaft. The safety devices can work even if the robot's controller does not work. Firstly, we describe the characteristics of the safety device. Secondly, we explain the walking support robot and the structure and mechanism of the safety device. Thirdly, we show the walking support robot which we developed. Finally, we experimentally verify the effectiveness of the safety device.",

As a tradeoff of rapidity and accuracy, the combined joint control algorism was implemented on the robot system. The algorism could tune the stiffness of the joint automatically to fit the compliance need for joint control. The experiments on our robot showed that the joint control algorism could operate the robot with a fast and accurate response.

Our robot provides frequent hair washing and a higher Quality Of Life (QOL) to patients and others who need such nursing care. Its elemental technologies include the following: a cylindrical rack mechanism for self-aligning and a drive-force transmission from an electric motor to multiple fingers, a five-bar closed link mechanism to expand the area of the head that can be washed by extension motion, and rear pressure force control by a coordinated double arm motion to switch between supporting and washing the head. In addition, we introduce an orientation correction mechanism into our five-bar closed link mechanism to keep the end effector's contact face aligned along the head's surface. This paper presents several elemental technologies and the kinematics of a five-bar closed link mechanism and discusses the improvement of the head shape following capability using an orientation correction mechanism.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss the development of the sprawling-type quadruped robot named \u201cTITAN-XIII\u201d and its dynamic walking algorithm. We develop an experimental quadruped robot especially designed for dynamic walking. Unlike dog-like robots, the prototype robot looks like a four-legged spider. As an experimental robot, we focus on the three basic concepts: lightweight, wide range of motion and ease of maintenance. To achieve these goals, we introduce a wire-driven mechanism using a synthetic fiber to transmit power to each axis making use of this wire-driven mechanism, we can locate the motors at the base of the leg, reducing, consequently, its inertia. Additionally, each part of the robot is unitized, and can be easily disassembled. As a dynamic walking algorithm, we proposed what we call \u201clongitudinal acceleration trajectory\u201d. This trajectory was applied to intermittent trot gait. The algorithm was tested with the developed robot, and its performance was confirmed through experiments.",

However, the previous microhand has problems about workspace and vibration. In this paper, the development of a new microhand which solves problems of previous microhand. The characteristic of new microhand is to enlarge the workspace utilizing the singularity of the parallel mechanisms. Inverse kinematics and structural analysis are used to analyze the workspace, and we show that results of two analyses match. Vibration analysis simulates transportation task and grasping task for manipulation. The new microhand has a potential to reduce the vibration by vibration analysis results.",

        "abstract": "During a volcanic activity, it is very dangerous to approach a restricted area. For this reason, robotic remote observation system would be quite useful, and it is particularly urgent for a country with a high degree of volcanic activity, such as Japan. In response to this need, our research group developed a novel multi-D.O.F. tracked vehicle, called ELF, which can conduct observation in a restricted volcanic area. The robot essentially consists of six tracks, and it has eleven actuators that change its configuration. These actuators enable the robot to assume various configurations, which increase its ability to traverse weak and rough terrains in the area around a volcano. In this research, we propose one configuration of the robot, in which the surface of the contact plane at the bottom of the track is horizontal, which is advantageous for traversing a weak slope. The feasibility of this design was verified in a field experiment on Mt. Kushigata, on the island of Izu-Oshima, and in a simulated volcanic field that was filled with pumice stones.",

In contrast, dry contact electrodes and noncontact capacitive coupling electrodes have been developed. However, their use has several limitations. In this research, we developed a hybrid electrode that is capable of both capacitive and resistive recordings by optimizing the sensor input impedance value using a new electrode noise model that contained noise sources. We extend this design so that noise originated during real usage, such as motion artifacts and noise from electric motors is also measured and removed from the sensor output. In experiments, noise analysis and experiments were performed by measuring myoelectrical signals from both upper and lower limbs in realistic situations, including weight lifting, robot arm control, and walking on a treadmill. As the results, we verified that our electrodes were capable of bioelectrical measurements at noise levels comparable to wet electrodes in realistic situations and with high correlation coefficients between both types of sensors.",

The suction mechanism at the fingertips enhances grasp stability, and enables the hand to hold large objects. In addition, the combination of the grasp mechanism and the suction system make it possible to perform some dexterous manipulations. Examples of the manipulations include the picking up a thin object and the packaging an object in a bag. These manipulations generally require hands with many degrees of freedom and intricate control.

        "abstract": "In a previous study we developed an expansion and contraction actuator using PVC gel. We investigated the characteristics of the PVC gel actuator and found that its stiffness changed noticeably with a variation in the applied DC field. In this study, we designed new variable stiffness spats for walking assistance by incorporating the variable stiffness PVC gel actuator in generally used spats. The stiffness of the spats can be varied with the on and off switching of an electric field. We believe that the spats can assist walking by restraining and releasing body motion with different stiffness while walking, and conducted experiments to evaluate their effectiveness. It was found that the integrated electromyogram (IEMG) and maximal voluntary contraction (%MVC) of the rectus femoris muscle decreased during walking when wearing them which indicated that the gel spats designed in this study were effective in assisting walking.",

Considering the friction lag as a first order time delay element behind the static friction nonlinearity a reasonable approximation of friction dynamics in sliding is proposed. The regression signal model is derived based on a discrete-time transformation of motion dynamics with nonlinear friction. A robust identification scheme is formulated in the Least-Squares (LS) sense by using an appropriate set of model-related regressors. Further, the related Recursive-Least-Squares (RLS) formulation is provided. The proposed modeling and identification are evaluated experimentally by the offline and online parameter estimation. For these purposes the first vertical rotary joint of the base of a standard industrial robotic manipulator has been used in laboratory environment.",

The control system has been modeled as a classical inner-loop/outer-loop architecture, adopted in several industrial robotic systems. The inner-loop is composed of a servo-level joint controller, and higher level kinematic feedback is performed in the outer-loop. Heterogeneous dynamics is considered in the inner-loop, which can for instance describe redundant coordination/synchronization control systems with cooperative robots with non-identical dynamical responses. There are surprisingly few discrete-time stability results in the current state-of-the-art for this popular control architecture. The qualitative effects of the inner-loop dynamics on the overall stability of the system is investigated, and improved outer-loop feedback gain margins are derived.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We present a provably-good distributed algorithm for generalized task assignment problem in the context of multirobot systems, where robots cooperate to complete a set of given tasks. In multi-robot generalized assignment problem (MR-GAP), each robot has its own resource constraint (e.g., energy constraint), and needs to consume a certain amount of resource to obtain a payoff for each task. The objective is to find a maximum payoff assignment of tasks to robots such that each task is assigned to at most one robot while respecting robots' resource constraints. MR-GAP is a NP-hard problem. It is an extension of multi-robot linear assignment problem since different robots can use different amount of resource for doing a task (due to the heterogeneity of robots and tasks). We first present an auction-based iterative algorithm for MR-GAP assuming the presence of a shared memory (or centralized auctioneer), where each robot uses a knapsack algorithm as a subroutine to iteratively maximize its own objective (using a modified payoff function based on an auxiliary variable, called price of a task). Our iterative algorithm can be viewed as (an approximation of) best response assignment update rule of each robot to the assignment of other robots at that iteration. We prove that our algorithm converges to an assignment (approximately) at equilibrium under the assignment update rule, with an approximation ratio of 1+\u03b1 (where \u03b1 is the approximation ratio for the Knapsack problem). We also combine our algorithm with a message passing mechanism to remove the requirement of a shared memory and make our algorithm totally distributed assuming the robots' communication network is connected. Finally, we present simulation results to depict our algorithm's performance.",

        "abstract": "Cable-driven parallel robots (CDPR) are efficient manipulators able to carry heavy payloads across large workspaces. Therefore, the dynamic parameters such as the mobile platform mass and center of mass location may considerably vary. Without any adaption, the erroneous parametric estimate results in mismatch terms added to the closed-loop system, which may decrease the robot performances. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive dual-space motion control scheme for CDPR. The proposed method aims at increasing the robot tracking performances, while keeping all the cable tensed despite uncertainties and changes in the robot dynamic parameters. Reel-time experimental tests, performed on a large redundantly actuated CDPR prototype, validate the efficiency of the proposed control scheme. These results are compared to those obtained with a non-adaptive dual-space feedforward control scheme.",

The manipulator control is based on the Dynamic Movement Primitives model, specialized for the object hand-over context. The proposed modifications enable finer control of the dynamic of the DMP to align it to human control strategies, where the contributions of the feedforward and feedback parts of the control are different to the original DMP formulation. Furthermore, the proposed scheme handles moving goals. With these two modifications, the model no longer requires an explicit estimation of the exchange position and it can generate motion purely reactively to the instantaneous position of the human hand. The quality of the control system is evaluated through an extensive comparison with ground truth data related to the object interaction between two humans acquired in the context of the European project CogLaboration which envisages an application in an industrial setting.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel dynamic kinesthetic boundary to aid a pilot to navigate an aerial robotic vehicle through a cluttered environment. Classical haptic teleoperation interfaces for aerial vehicles utilize force feedback to provide the pilot with a haptic feel of the robot's interaction with an environment. The proposed approach constructs a dynamic kinesthetic boundary on the master device that provides the pilot with hard boundaries in the haptic workspace to indicate approaching obstacles. An advantage of the proposed approach is that when the vehicle is flying free of obstacles, then the haptic feedback of the joystick can be used to provide a more natural feel of the vehicle dynamics. Furthermore, rather than a gradual onset of virtual potential forces that are felt in the classical approaches, a pilot encountering the dynamic kinesthetic boundary is immediately aware of the presence of the obstacle and can act accordingly. The approach is implemented on an admittance haptic joystick to ensure that the haptic boundaries are faithfully rendered. We prove that in the case of perfect velocity tracking, the proposed algorithm will ensure the vehicle never colliding with the environment. Experiments were conducted on a robotic platform and the results provide verification of the novel approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the dynamic modeling and analysis of a three-wheeled omnidirectional mobile robot with MY wheels-II, whose dynamics is nonlinear and piecewise-smooth. Firstly, the detailed dynamic model of the robot is derived, which shows that the robot is actually a switched nonlinear system. Analysis of the robot dynamic properties based on the detailed dynamic model is presented in detail. Then to facilitate the controller design for the switched nonlinear system, based on the detailed dynamic model, an average dynamic model is proposed by simply averaging the wheel contact radius. The resulting average dynamic model is nonlinear and smooth, which may then be used as one solution for the model-based control design. Open-loop simulation results show the dynamic properties of the mobile robot. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed average model in predicting characteristics of the detailed dynamic model is also illustrated through open-loop simulations.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Elastic robots have a distinct feature that makes them especially interesting to optimal control: their ability to mechanically store and release potential energy. However, solving any kind of optimal control problem for such highly nonlinear dynamics is feasible only numerically, i.e. offline. In turn, optimal solutions would only contribute a clear benefit for dynamic environments/tasks (apart from rather general insights), if they would be accessible/generalizable in real-time. In this paper, we propose a framework for executing near-optimal motions for elastic arms in real-time. We approach the problem as follows. First, we define a set of prototypical optimal control problems. These represent a reasonable set of motions that an intrinsically elastic robot arm is sought to execute. Exemplary, we solve the optimal control problem for some of these prototypes in a roughly covered task space. Then, we encode the resulting optimal trajectories in a dynamical system via Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs). Finally, a distance and cost function based metric forms the basis to generalize from the learned parameterizations to a new unsolved optimal control problem in real-time. In short, we intend to overcome the well known problems of optimal control and learning with associated generalization: being offline and being suboptimal, respectively.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Off-line robot dynamic identification methods are generally based on the use of the Inverse Dynamic Identification Model (IDIM), which calculates the joint forces/torques (estimated as the product of the known control signal - the input reference of the motor current loop - by the joint drive gains) that are linear in relation to the dynamic parameters, and on the use of linear least squares technique to calculate the parameters (IDIM-LS technique). However, as actuation redundant parallel robot are overconstrained, their IDIM has infinity of solutions for the force/torque prediction, depending of the value of the desired overconstraint that is a priori unknown in the identification process. As a result, the IDIM cannot be used for the identification procedure. On the contrary the Power Identification Model (PIM) of any types of robot manipulator has a unique formulation and contains the same dynamic parameters as the IDIM. This paper proposes to use the PIM of actuation redundant robots for identification purpose. The identification of the inertial parameters of a planar parallel robot with actuation redundancy, the DualV, is then carried out using its PIM. Experimental results show the validity of the method.",

Often times, it is necessary to sacrifice optimality to find a feasible plan given a time constraint due to the search complexity. Dynamic environments may further invalidate current computed plans, requiring an efficient planning strategy that can repair existing solutions. This paper presents a massively parallelized wavefront-based approach to path planning, running on the GPU, that can efficiently repair plans to accommodate world changes and agent movement, without having to restart the wavefront propagation process. In addition, we introduce a termination condition which ensures the minimum number of GPU iterations while maintaining strict optimality constraints on search graphs with non-uniform costs.",

Functional principles of dynamic surface grasping are presented, and two prototype grasper designs are discussed. Computer simulation and physical testing confirms the expected relationships concerning (i) the alignment of the grasper at initial contact, (ii) the absorption of energy during collision and rebound, and (iii) the force limits of synthetic directional adhesives.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a trajectory generator and an active compliance control scheme, unified in a framework to synthesize dynamic, feasible and compliant trot-walking locomotion cycles for a stiff-by-nature hydraulically actuated quadruped robot. At the outset, a CoP-based trajectory generator that is constructed using an analytical solution is implemented to obtain feasible and dynamically balanced motion references in a systematic manner. Initial conditions are uniquely determined for symmetrical motion patterns, enforcing that trajectories are seamlessly connected both in position, velocity and acceleration levels, regardless of the given support phase. The active compliance controller, used simultaneously, is responsible for sufficient joint position/force regulation. An admittance block is utilized to compute joint displacements that correspond to joint force errors. In addition to position feedback, these joint displacements are inserted to the position control loop as a secondary feedback term. In doing so, active compliance control is achieved, while the position/force trade-off is modulated via the virtual admittance parameters. Various trot-walking experiments are conducted with the proposed framework using HyQ, a \u223c 75kg hydraulically actuated quadruped robot. We present results of repetitive, continuous, and dynamically equilibrated trot-walking locomotion cycles, both on level surface and uneven surface walking experiments.",

        "abstract": "We present a model-predictive trajectory planning algorithm for following a target boat by an autonomous unmanned surface vehicle (USV) in an environment with static obstacle regions and civilian boats. The planner developed in this work is capable of making a balanced trade-off among the following, possibly conflicting criteria: the risk of losing the target boat, trajectory length, risk of collision with obstacles, violation of the Coast Guard Collision Regulations (COLREGs), also known as \u201crules of the road\u201d, and execution of avoidance maneuvers against vessels that do not follow the rules. The planner addresses these criteria by combining a search for a dynamically feasible trajectory to a suitable pose behind the target boat in 4D state space, forming a time-extended lattice, and reactive planning that tracks this trajectory using control actions that respect the USV dynamics and are compliant with COLREGs. The reactive part of the planner represents a generalization of the velocity obstacles paradigm by computing obstacles in the control space using a system-identified, dynamic model of the USV as well as worst-case and probabilistic predictive motion models of other vessels. We present simulation and experimental results using an autonomous unmanned surface vehicle platform and a human-driven vessel to demonstrate that the planner is capable of fulfilling the above mentioned criteria.",

A camera positioning mechanism with piezoelectric cellular actuators will be employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. There are a number of mechanisms for automatic camera positioning, but few have much in common with the human ocular positioning system. When a rapid point-to-point motion is created in a camera positioner, like human saccadic motion, the image sensor receives blurry images. Existing image techniques rely solely on obtained images, or use external sensors to estimate a blur kernel, or point spread function (PSF), for motion deblurring. Inspired by recent oculomotor studies, this paper proposes a method for estimating PSFs directly from the system dynamics of a camera positioning mechanism without motion sensors. The proposed method has been evaluated by using a single degree-of-freedom camera orientation system. Results are compared with conventional methods in terms of speed and accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Electrooculogram (EOG) signals are potential responses generated by eye movements, and event related potential (ERP) is a special electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern which evoked by external stimuli. Both EOG and ERP have been used separately for implementing human-machine interfaces which can assist disabled patients in performing daily tasks. In this paper, we present a novel EOG/ERP hybrid human-machine interface which integrates the traditional EOG and ERP interfaces together. Eye movements like the blink, wink, gaze, and frown are detected from EOG signals using double threshold algorithm. Multiple ERP components, i.e., N170, VPP and P300 are evoked by inverted face stimuli and classified by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Based on this hybrid interface, we also design a control scheme for the humanoid robot NAO (Aldebaran robotics, Inc). On-line experiment results show that the proposed hybrid interface can effectively control the robot's basic movements and order it to make various behaviors. While normally operating the robot by hands takes 49.1 s to complete the experiment sessions, using the proposed EOG/ERP interface, the subject is able to finish the sessions in 54.1 s.",

We show that using adequate visual information, pose estimation can be performed in a decoupling the estimation of translation and rotation. More precisely, we show that pose estimation can be achieved iteratively as a function of only three independent unknowns, which are the translation parameters. An invariant to rotational motion is used to estimate the camera position. Once the camera position is estimated, we show that the rotation can be estimated efficiently using a direct method. The proposed approach is compared against two classical methods from the literature. The results show that using our method, pose tracking in image sequences and the convergence rate for randomly generated poses are improved.",

        "abstract": "A modular robot consists of a set of mechatronic modules that can be connected in many different ways, which makes it possible to build robots of many different shapes from the same basic set of modules. The main contribution of this work is an algorithm that, given the parameters of a module and the number of modules, efficiently can calculate how many different configurations and shapes can be built. These numbers are important because the first is a measure of the self-reconfigurability and the second, given there is a relationship between form and function, the versatility of a modular robot. As an experimental contribution, we enumerate the configuration and shape spaces of square, two-dimensional modules with all possible connector configurations. We proceed to three dimensions and enumerate the spaces of the theoretically interesting sliding cube module, and the M-TRAN and SuperBot modules. Several observations are made, an important one is that the shape spaces of the two physical modules are large even for a small number of modules (103 different shapes using 3 modules). This implies that it is not the lack of shape diversity that holds these modular robots back from being versatile. A result that suggests that if modules are designed right, versatility can potentially be reached even with few modules, which is contrary to the common belief in the community that more is better.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Map based navigation is a crucial task for any mobile robot. On many platforms this problem is addressed by applying Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) based on metric grid-maps. Such solutions work well on robots with adequate resources and limited workspaces. Platforms with limited payload which operate in unbounded workspaces, do often have insufficient resources to keep a metric world representation. Nevertheless, many applications demand that the robot can autonomously navigate between different operation areas. In this work the Landmark-Tree map (LT-map), a resource efficient topological map concept, is for the first time applied to a mobile robotic platform equipped with an omnidirectional camera. It enables the robot to efficiently adapt the acquired map online to the available memory. During map acquisition and navigation the motion is estimated by the Z\u221e-algorithm. Both methods are based on similar concepts, which results in a mutual benefit. An efficient navigation strategy based on the LT-map allows the robot to reliably follow previously recorded paths. The presented approach is evaluated on a mobile robot in indoor and outdoor scenarios. The experiments prove its feasibility and show that pruning the map just smooths the trajectories, which is the expected and desired behaviour.",

In this work, we present a navigation strategy for a holonomic mobile robot with anyshape footprint. Our technique introduces an efficient navigation method based on a strategy that makes use of discrete and continuous techniques. We introduce compact discrete intervals to represent the free space for computing fast-to-update plans. Based on these, we provide a continuous motion generation approach to generate smooth motions that are fast to compute. We evaluated our approach by running simulated experiments and by using a real holonomic L-shaped robot. Our experiments demonstrate that our technique can be carried out online and is able to smoothly drive the robot to its goal locations even in dynamic environments.",

        "abstract": "Recent motion planners, such as RRT*, that achieve asymptotic optimality require a local planner, which connects two states with a trajectory. For systems with dynamics, the local planner corresponds to a two-point boundary value problem (BVP) solver, which is not always available. Furthermore, asymptotically optimal solutions tend to increase computational costs relative to alternatives, such as RRT, that focus on feasibility. This paper describes a sampling-based solution with the following desirable properties: a) it does not require a BVP solver but only uses a forward propagation model, b) it employs a single propagation per iteration similar to RRT, making it very efficient, c) it is asymptotically near-optimal, and d) provides a sparse data structure for answering path queries, which further improves computational performance. Simulations on prototypical dynamical systems show the method is able to improve the quality of feasible solutions over time and that it is computationally efficient.",

This paper presents two approaches for the problem. Firstly, we present a heuristic that solves it in two steps, based on classical techniques found in the literature. Secondly, we employ a Memetic Algorithm to solve both combinatorial and continuous phases of the problem in a combined manner. We provide formal analysis about both proposed techniques, presenting upper bounds to the length of the longest tour. Numerous trials in simulated environments were executed, providing statistical examination of the final results.",

        "abstract": "Many groups of agents exhibit emergent collective behaviors. The environment in which the agents operate is one determinant of the resulting behaviors. This work shows how automatic enumeration of environments enables exploration of various collective behaviors that perform useful group functions (e.g. segregation, corralling, shape formation). Although groups of agents, such as mobile robots, can be manipulated through explicit control, this study shows that these systems can be usefully manipulated without resorting to such imperative means. This method has obvious uses for heterogeneous robot systems, especially those which include large numbers of simple agents. The method introduced is general, in that it takes as input: (1) algorithmic specifications of the environment generation, (2) a black-box model of the individual agent's control laws, and (3) a mathematical description of the task objective. To show the validity of the proposed method this investigation studies two behaviors (splitting and corralling) for three commonly studied motion models, including the well known Reynold's model. Simulations and physical multi-robot trials show that automatically generated environments can elicit pre-specified behaviors from a group of individual agents. Additionally, this work investigates the effects of a group's emergent properties on the ability to elicit the specified behavior via the environment. The findings suggest that automatically exploring environments can lead to better exploration and understanding of collective behaviors, including the identification of previously unknown emergent behaviors.",

As cars waste most of the fuel in city traffic and especially in queuing at traffic lights, the presented framework provides solutions to save fuel and to protect the environment. The solutions are obtained using the definition of spent physical work which has to be minimized. It covers both cases, that the time of switching of the traffic lights is known and that the time of switching can only be modeled as a stochastic process. For a known time of switching a continuous solution is derived using Pontryagin Minimum Principle; in the stochastic case a modified Bellmann equation is formulated. The latter is solved with dynamic programming techniques. The presented solutions can be used for autonomous driving as well as for driving assistant systems. Simulation results show the potential savings using the presented approach.",

Wind energy is generally harvested using wind turbines. Unfortunately, these systems have some drawbacks such as their cost, and the amount of steel and concrete used for construction. As their size grows, their complexity increases exponentially. This paper studies an alternative solution for the production of wind energy, using a kite's traction force. The aim of this paper is to control the amount of energy produced by the kite, and to be able to fly it safely in the presence of strong wind gusts. Our theoretical work has been implemented in a scale model flying autonomously in a wind tunnel. The proposed control strategy has led to control the system output power with an accuracy greater than 95%, with unknown wind speeds varying from 7.5 to 9 m/s.",

        "abstract": "Enhancing the realism of the perceived contact force is a primary challenge in haptic rendering of virtual walls (VWs) and objects (VOs). For VOs, this goal directly translates into accurate rendering of not only stiffness, but also mass. The most challenging situation arises when the stiffness of the object is large, its mass is small, and sampling is slow. To address this challenge, a framework entitled high-fidelity haptic rendering (HFCR) has been developed. The HFCR framework is composed of the following three main strategies: an energy-consistent rendering of the contact force, smooth transition between contact modes, and remaining leak dissipation. The essence of all these strategies is to make the energy of the VO emulate its continuous-time counterpart. This is achieved through physically meaningful modifications in the constitutive relations to suppress artificial energy leaks. This paper reports simulation and experiments involving the one-dimensional canonical model of a VO to illustrate the HFCR framework and compare it to the existing methods. Results demonstrate the promising stability and force rendering fidelity of this framework.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies on underactuated manipulation usually describe the system with a Kinematic Model (KM), which is built by adding external constraints to the standard manipulation analysis method. However, such external constraints are easily violated in a real-world dexterous manipulation task which results in significant control errors. In this work, the Enhanced Kinematic Model (E-KM), an integrated model of the KM and the Sparse Online Gaussian Process (SOGP) is proposed. The E-KM can compensate the shortfalls of the KM by on-the-fly training the SOGP on the residual between the prediction of the KM and the ground truth data. Based on the E-KM, we further contribute an optimal controller for underactuated manipulations. This optimal E-KM controller is implemented and tested on the iCub, a humanoid robot with two anthropomorphic underactuated hands. Two sets of real-world experiments are carried out to verify our method. The results demonstrate that the controller using E-KM statistically can achieve higher control accuracy than using solely using the KM for a wide range of objects.",

While the use of geometry has commonly helped to validate appearance as a back-end process in several relocalisation systems before, we are interested in using 3D information to assist fast pose relocalisation computation as part of a front-end task. Our approach rapidly searches for a reduced number of visual descriptors, previously observed and stored in a database, that can be used to effectively compute the camera pose corresponding to the current view. We guide the search by means of constructing validated candidate sets using a 3D test involving the depth information obtained with an RGB-D camera (e.g. stereo of with structured light). Our experiments demonstrate that this process returns a compact quality set that works better for the pose estimation stage than when using a typical Nearest-Neighbor search over appearance only. The improvements are observed in terms of percentage of relocalised frames and speed, where the latter goes up to two orders of magnitude w.r.t. the conventional search.",

However, it may be difficult to obtain accurate models of novel objects due to incomplete and noisy sensory measurements. In addition, object shape may change due to frequent interaction with the object (cereal boxes, etc). In this paper, we present a probabilistic approach for learning object models based on visual and tactile perception through physical interaction with an object. Our robot explores unknown objects by touching them strategically at parts that are uncertain in terms of shape. The robot starts by using only visual features to form an initial hypothesis about the object shape, then gradually adds tactile measurements to refine the object model. Our experiments involve ten objects of varying shapes and sizes in a real setup. The results show that our method is capable of choosing a small number of touches to construct object models similar to real object shapes and to determine similarities among acquired models.",

        "abstract": "Given a stochastic policy learned by reinforcement, we wish to ensure that it can be deployed on a robot with demonstrably low probability of unsafe behavior. Our case study is about learning to reach target objects positioned close to obstacles, and ensuring a reasonably low collision probability. Learning is carried out in a simulator to avoid physical damage in the trial-and-error phase. Once a policy is learned, we analyze it with probabilistic model checking tools to identify and correct potential unsafe behaviors. The whole process is automated and, in principle, it can be integrated step-by-step with routine task-learning. As our results demonstrate, automated fixing of policies is both feasible and highly effective in bounding the probability of unsafe behaviors.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, an automatic erect stair climbing mobile robot is developed for indoor service applications. The design of high center of mass, tilt axis near ground, and the triangular wheel-legged structure enable the robot to climb stairs in a dynamic and self-balancing way. The wheel-legged mechanism also keeps the advantages of differential-wheeled mobile platforms when moving on flat ground, such as easy to control, saving power, and zero turning radius. Moreover, the overall mechanical design fits the requirements for a service robot to have proper height and small footprint, which can make human-robot interaction more natural and comfortable in indoor environment. Since the perceptual and control system of the robot are both well integrated, we successfully demonstrate the stair-climbing function and prove that the design and implementation of our work are feasible and efficient. As a result, the robot is expected to be a prototype of universal platform for indoor mobile service robots in the future.",

However, a reliable fusion requires the knowledge of the uncertainty of each estimate. In this work, we provide an error analysis for the Z\u221e algorithm. Furthermore, we extend the existing first-order error propagation for the 8-point algorithm to allow for feature normalization, as proposed by Hartley or M\u00fchlich, and the rotation matrix based decomposition. Both methods are efficient visual odometry techniques which allow high frame-rates and, thus, dynamic motions in unbounded workspaces. Finally, we provide experiments which validate the accuracy of the error propagation and which enable a brief comparison, showing that the Z\u221e significantly outperforms the 8-point algorithm. We also discuss the influence of the number of features, the aperture angle, and the image resolution on the accuracy of the pose estimation.",

Manipulator tasks such as grasping, assembly and disassembly can generally be divided into several motion primitives. We call such motion primitives \u201cskills\u201d and explain how most manipulator tasks can be composed of sequences of these skills. We will address the issues involved with various types of robots such as maintenance robots and service robots. We have considered hierarchizing the manipulation tasks of these robots since their tasks have become more complex than ever before. Additionally, as errors are seen likely to increase in complex tasks, it is important to implement effective error recovery technology. This paper presents our proposal for a new type of error recovery that uses the concepts of task stratification and error classification which can be expressed specifically using flow charts.",

By measuring the acceleration of the end-effector, the arm angular position accuracy is improved when the measurements are fused with motor angle observations. The estimation problem is formulated in a Bayesian estimation framework where three solutions are proposed: one using the extended Kalman filter (EKF), one using the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and one using the particle filter (PF). The estimates are used in an ILC method to improve the accuracy for following a given reference trajectory. Since the ILC algorithm is repetitive no computational restrictions on the methods apply explicitly. In an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study it is shown that the PF method outperforms the other methods and that the ILC control law is substantially improved using the PF estimate.",

A method for designing protective structures to meet the specific constraints of flying systems is presented and applied to the protection of a small coaxial hovering platform. Protective structures in the form of Euler springs in a tetrahedral configuration are designed and optimised to elastically absorb the energy of an impact while simultaneously minimizing the forces acting on the robot's stiff inner frame. These protective structures are integrated into a 282 g hovering platform and shown to consistently withstand dozens of collisions undamaged.",

We introduce several model-based learning agents as mechanisms to control a noisy, low-cost robotic system. The agents were tested in a simulated domain for learning closed-loop policies of a simple task with no prior information.

        "abstract": "Prosthetic hands have evolved and improved over the years, helping people gaining manipulation capabilities. Having a simulation tool able to obtain quantitative evaluation of the grasp capabilities of such hands could give insights as how to improve the design of hand prostheses or robotic hands by means of obtaining better quality scores. The purpose of this work is to present a framework developed to evaluate the grasp capabilities of a prosthetic hand using a selected set of grasp quality measures, and compare the results with the ones obtained for the human hand using a biomechanical model. Experiments grasping an object with different postures and varying aspects of the prosthetic hand model were performed showing the functionality of the proposed framework to evaluate the grasp quality.",

There are studies on fidelity of torque sensors and backdrivability individually, but limited study are made on investigating effect of torque fidelity and backdrivability on force sensitivity of the actuation system. In this paper, we developed backdrivable electro-hydrostatic actuator equipped with torque sensor to analyze the effect of torque fidelity and backdrivability on force sensitive control system. We implemented friction compensation controller and evaluated force sensitivity of the actuator by residual friction torque after the friction compensation. Method using pressure sensor and torque sensor were compared. Effect of backdrivability was performed by comparing friction torque of Harmonic Drive joint and joint with developed actuator.",

Event-based asynchronous cameras encode visual information in an extremely optimal manner in term of redundancy reduction and energy consumption. These sensors open vast perspectives in the field of mobile robotics where responsiveness is one of the most important needed property. The presented technique, based on echo-state networks will be shown particularly suited for unsupervised features extraction in the context of high dynamic environments. Experimental results are presented, they show the method adequacy with the high data sparseness and temporal resolution of event-based acquisition. This allows features extraction at millisecond accuracy with a low computational cost.",

Control software must simultaneously maximise the area explored whilst maintaining safety and working within the constraints of the platform. Scoring functions to assess navigational options are typically written by hand and manually refined. As navigational tasks become more complex this manual approach is unlikely to yield the best results. In this paper we explore the automatic derivation of a scoring function for a ground based exploration platform. We show that it is possible to derive the entire structure of a scoring function and that allowing structure to evolve yields significant performance advantages over the evolution of embedded constants alone.",

Previous work showed that such a collection of robots can be approximately steered to arbitrary Cartesian positions, but not to arbitrary heading angles in a global reference frame. We extend this work by proving we can always steer such a collection of robots exactly to arbitrary range and bearing locations relative to targets in R2 in a finite number of steps. We also provide existence proofs for controlling the final heading angles of many robots. This work addresses a fundamental challenge in micro-and nanorobotics with possible applications in targeted therapy, sensing, and actuation. Scale hardware experiments validate the control policy.

This algorithm uses case-based reasoning to obtain the available prior information of the current environment.

Communication and coordination is difficult, with high-level actors (e.g. mission commander) lacking local terrain knowledge while low-level actors (e.g. robot operators, in-field rescuers) lack global situation awareness (SA). In-field actors have high mobility and a direct view of the field, but so far they could communicate this SA almost exclusively through radio. Unfortunately, words are imprecise and unorganized, and thus not easily analyzable and retrievable. As part of the NIFTi1 project, we developed mobile applications to help in-field actors share their SA with the rescue team. We also performed high-fidelity USAR simulations and missions at fire fighting training sites and disaster areas. We discovered a need for persistent geo-localized information and propose a novel system architecture that integrates pictures taken from robots and from in-field rescuers into the existing systems at the command post.",

There are many models and processes available for structured development, including the well-known Waterfall and Agile models. Recent standards for safety-critical system development utilise the V-model, such as the process given in the ISO 26262 standard for functional safety of road vehicles. However, the process clashes with the commonly-expressed desire for greater reuse of development artifacts in robotics. We have experimented with applying a process, the Object-Oriented Systems Engineering Method, to the design of a robotic wheelchair. This paper describes our application of the process to a safety-critical robot, as well as our use of SysML for managing design information and ZipC for code generation and verification. We discuss our experiences, both good and bad, in order to inform other robot developers of what to consider when choosing a process and tools.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the experimental validation of software-based safety features implemented during the control of a prosthetic limb in self-feeding tasks with a human patient. To ensure safe operation during patient controlled movements of the limb, velocity-based virtual fixtures are constructed with respect to the patient's location and orientation relative to the limb. These imposed virtual fixtures or safety zones modulate the allowable movement direction and speed of the limb to ensure patient safety during commanded limb trajectories directed toward the patient's body or environmental obstacles. In this implementation, the Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) will be controlled by a quadriplegic patient using implanted intracortical electrodes. These virtual fixtures leverage existing sensors internal to the MPL and operate in conjunction with the existing limb control. Validation of the virtual fixtures was conducted by executing a recorded set of limb control inputs while collecting both direct feedback from the limb sensors and ground truth measurements of the limb configuration using a Vicon tracking system. Analysis of the collected data indicates that the system performed within the limitations prescribed by the imposed virtual fixtures. This successful implementation and validation enabled the approved clinical use of the MPL system for a neural controlled self-feeding task.",

        "abstract": "Over the last four years, we have been slowly ramping up explicit knowledge representation and manipulation in the deliberative and executive layers of our robots. Ranging from situation assessment to symbolic task planning, from verbal interaction to event-driven execution control, we have built up a knowledge-oriented architecture which is now used on a daily basis on our robots. This article presents our design choices, the articulations between the diverse deliberative components of the robot, and the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. We show that explicit knowledge management is not only a convenient tool from the software engineering point of view, but also pushes for a different, more semantic way to address the decision-making issue in autonomous robots.",

        "abstract": "Eye movements play an essential role in planning and executing manual actions. Eye-hand coordination is a natural human skill. We exploit this skill for an intuitive remote manipulation system that allows even non-expert users to operate a robot safely without prior experience. Specifically, we propose a visio-haptic approach to controlling a 7-DOF robotic arm. Our system is fully mobile, allowing for unconstraint operation in any environment. An eyetracker captures the operator's gaze. The end effector or particular joints are selected by simply fixating the to-be-controlled segment. A sensor-equipped tangible object provides a haptic interface between the operator's hand and the focused part of the robotic arm. The system features two operation modes, direct joint rotation and 3d end effector control in a global cartesian frame. We evaluated the system in a proof-of-concept study with untrained users. The participants safely operated the robot and accomplished an obstacle avoidance task. For this purpose, they used both operation modes.",

This paper reports a reconfigurable design approach to robotic legged locomotion that produces a wide variety of gait cycles, opening new possibilities for innovative applications. In this paper, we present a distance-based formulation and its application to solve the position analysis problem of a standard Theo Jansen mechanism. By changing the configuration of a linkage, our objective in this study is to identify novel gait patterns of interest for a walking platform. The exemplary gait variations presented in this work demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, and considerably extend the capabilities of the original design to not only produce novel cum useful gait patterns but also to realize behaviors beyond locomotion.",

Efficient implementations for their computation have been developed, that even allow their usage in real-time telemanipulation applications. However, the main problems in the computation of contact regions are that they strongly depend on the initial grasp used as an starting point, and that for a given initial grasp there is not a unique set of contact regions. This paper analyzes the optimality of current approaches for ICR computation in 2D, where the optimal regions are still easily computable, and proposes an algorithm to obtain contact regions closer to the optimal ones. The approach is implemented and analyzed for 2D and 3D objects with any number of contact points.",

The traditional approach to represent an object is based on a summarization of the local characteristics by counting the number of feature occurrences. In this paper we propose the use of a recently developed technique for summarizations that, rather than looking into the quantity of features, encodes their quality to learn a description of an object. Our approach is based on extracting and aggregating only the essential characteristics of an object class for a task. We show how the proposed method significantly improves on previous work in 3D object categorization. We discuss the benefits of the method in other scenarios such as robot grasping. We provide extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments comparing our approach to the state of the art to justify the described approach.",

In this paper we take advantage of this structured information to build an efficient shape descriptor which is about two orders of magnitude faster than competing approaches, while showing similar performance in several tasks involving deformable object recognition. Given a 2D patch surrounding a point and its associated depth values, we build the descriptor for that point, based on the cumulative distances between their normals and a discrete set of normal directions. This processing is made very efficient using integral images, even allowing to compute descriptors for every range image pixel in a few seconds. The discriminative power of our descriptor, dubbed FINDDD, is evaluated in three different scenarios: recognition of specific cloth wrinkles, instance recognition from geometry alone, and detection of reliable and informed grasping points.",

In this paper, we report a novel method of constructing multi-layered microstructures embedding cells via microfluidic devices. The on-chip fabrication of movable microstructures embedding fibroblasts (NIH/3T3) based on Poly (ethylene glycol) Diacrylate (PEGDA) was reported. Two approaches for assembling these movable microstructures were presented. One was a manual assembly method based on micromanipulation system and the other one was a self-assembly method based on microfluidic channel. Several manual assembly ways were demonstrated and a tube-shaped microstructure with 17 layers was assembled by an efficient assembly method. A novel microfluidic channel was presented for conducting self-assembly method and a 2-layered experimental microfluidic device was fabricated by Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The self-assembly process of fabricated microstructures via this device was preliminarily demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel dot-pattern-projection three-dimensional (3-D) shape measurement method that can measure 3-D displacements of blink dots projected onto a measured object accurately even when it moves rapidly or is observed from a camera as moving rapidly. In our method, blinking dot patterns, in which each dot changes its size at different timings corresponding to its identification (ID) number, are projected from a projector at a high frame rate. 3-D shapes can be obtained without any miscorrespondence of the projected dots between frames by simultaneous tracking and identification of multiple dots projected onto a measured 3-D object in a camera view. Our method is implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based high-frame-rate (HFR) vision platform that can track and recognize as much as 15\u00d715 blink-dot pattern in a 512\u00d7512 image in real time at 1000 fps, synchronized with an HFR projector. We demonstrate the performance of our system by showing real-time 3-D measurement results when our system is mounted on a parallel link manipulator as a sensing head.",

This paper focuses on a particularly important challenge: mapping in dynamic environments. We introduce several improvements to the recently proposed Normal Distributions Transform Occupancy Map (NDT-OM) aimed for efficient mapping in dynamic environments. A careful consistency analysis is given based on convergence and similarity metrics specifically designed for evaluation of NDT maps in dynamic environments. We show that in the context of mapping with known poses the proposed method results in improved consistency and in superior runtime performance, when compared against 3D occupancy grids at the same size and resolution. Additionally, we demonstrate that NDT-OM features real-time performance in a highly dynamic 3D mapping and tracking scenario with centimeter accuracy over a 1.5km trajectory.",

The learning of the cascade classifier and its detection capability are validated using a proprietary dataset acquired using the Ladybug2 spherical camera and the public INRIA person detection dataset.

Our emphasis is on the fast execution of efficient search strategies that minimize the number of UAVs and the search time. We present the first approach for computing fast guaranteed search strategies utilizing additional searchers to speed up the execution time and thereby enabling large scale UAV search. In order to scale to very large environments when using UAVs one would either have to overcome the energy limitations of UAVs or pay the cost of utilizing additional UAVs to speed up the search. Our approach is based on coordinating UAVs on sweep lines, covered by the UAV sensors, that move simultaneously through an environment. We present some simulation results that show a significant reduction in execution time when using multiple UAVs and a demonstration of a real system with three AR.Drone 2.0.",

With the use of visual compliance and adoption of a light-weight 3-DOF active peg, decoupled alignment for position and attitude is realized. The active peg is capable of high-speed motion and with less dynamic defects than a traditional robot arm. Two high-speed cameras, one configured as eye-in-hand and the other as eye-to-hand are adopted to provide with the task-space feedback. Visual constraints for effecting the visual compliant motion are analyzed. Alignment experiments show that peg-and-hole alignment with the proposed approach could be successfully realized with robust convergence, and on average, the alignment could be realized within 0.7 s in our experimental setting.",

        "abstract": "A kinematically redundant robot with limited motion capabilities, expressed by inequality constraints of the box type on joint variables and commands, needs to perform a set of tasks, expressed by linear equality constraints on robot commands, possibly organized with priorities. Robot motion capabilities cannot be exceeded at any time, and the resulting constraints are to be considered as hard bounds. Instead, robot tasks can be relaxed by velocity scaling if no feasible solution exists. To address this redundancy resolution problem, we developed a method in which joint space commands are successively saturated and their effect compensated in the null space of a suitable task Jacobian (SNS, Saturation in the Null Space). Computationally efficient versions of the basic and optimal SNS algorithms are proposed here, based on a task augmentation reformulation, a QR factorization of the main matrices involved, and a so-called warm start procedure. The obtained performance allows to control in real time robots with high-dimensional configuration spaces executing a large number of prioritized tasks, and with an associated high number of hard bounds that saturate during motion.",

For this purpose our approach efficiently combines the strength of state of the art mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) solvers with human expertise in mission scheduling. We experimentally show that simple and intuitive inputs by a human user have substantial impact on both computation time and quality of the solution.

The investigated approach utilizes feature descriptors in order to assign correspondences between the data sets and to reduce complexity by considering only characteristic feature points. It is based on the decomposability of rigid motions into a rotation and a translation. The space of rotations is searched with a particle filter and scoring is performed by looking for clusters in the resulting sets of translations. We use features computed from homogeneous triangle meshes and point clouds that require low computation time. A major advantage of the approach proves to be the possible consideration of prior knowledge about the relative orientation. This is especially important when high noise levels produce deteriorated features that are hard to match correctly. Comparisons to existing algorithms show the method's competitiveness, and results in robotic applications with different sensor types are presented.",

        "abstract": "Biological robots can be produced in large numbers, but are often controlled by uniform inputs. This makes position control of multiple robots inherently challenging. This paper uses magnetically-steered ciliate eukaryon {Tetrahymena pyriformis) as a case study. These cells swim at a constant speed, and can be turned by changing the orientation of an external magnetic field. We show that it is possible to steer multiple T. pyriformis to independent goals if their turning \u2014 modeled as a first-order system \u2014 has unique time constants. We provide system identification tools to parameterize multiple cells in parallel. We construct feedback control-Lyapunov methods that exploit differing phase-lags under a rotating magnetic field to steer multiple cells to independent target positions. We prove that these techniques scale to any number of cells with unique first-order responses to the global magnetic field. We provide simulations steering hundreds of cells and validate our procedure in hardware experiments with multiple cells.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel fiber optic tactile probe designed for tissue palpation during minimally invasive surgery (MIS). The probe consists of 3\u00d74 tactile sensing elements at 2.6mm spacing with a dimension of 12\u00d718\u00d78 mm3 allowing its application via a 25mm surgical port. Each tactile element converts the applied pressure values into a circular image pattern. The image patterns of all the sensing elements are captured by a camera attached at the proximal end of the sensor system. Processing the intensity and the area of these circular patterns allows the computation of the applied pressure across the sensing array. Validation tests show that each sensing element of the tactile probe can measure forces from 0 to 1N with a resolution of 0.05 N. The proposed sensing concept is low cost, lightweight, sterilizable, easy to be miniaturized and compatible for magnetic resonance (MR) environments. Experiments using the developed sensor for tissue abnormality detection were conducted. Results show that the proposed tactile probe can accurately and effectively detect nodules embedded inside soft tissue, demonstrating the promising application of this probe for surgical palpation during MIS.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of generating the simplest plans that solve robotic planning problems. Most robotic planning algorithms are concerned with producing plans that minimize execution cost, or generalizations of such costs. Motivated by circumstances with severe computational resource limits (e.g., memory or communication constrained settings), we instead address the problem of producing concise plans. In this work, conciseness is a measure of plan size that reflects the complexity of representing the plan explicitly. We seek a plan with minimal representational size, subject to correctness and completeness. We introduce a planning algorithm that generates concise plans for planning problems that may involve both non-determinism and partial observability, and also show that finding the most concise plan is an NP-hard problem, excusing the possible sub-optimality of our algorithm's output. We describe an implementation of the algorithm, along with empirical results on the run time and solution quality for both manipulation and navigation problem domains.",

Although being designed for way-point generation in autonomous airborne mapping of outdoor environments, it works directly on raw point clouds and thus can be used with any sensor generating spatial occupancy information (e.g. LIDAR, kinect or Time-of-Flight cameras). To satisfy time-constraints introduced by operation on UAVs, the algorithm is implemented on a highly parallel architecture and benchmarked against the previous, CPU-based proof of concept. As the underlying hardware imposes limitations with regards to memory access and concurrency, necessary data structures and further performance considerations are explained in detail.

Anthropomorphic robot hands with tendon driven joints are typical examples of such systems. To overcome this difficulty, this paper proposes an approach that uses the torque saturation (max-torque) of the joint position control loops to control the end-effector (fingertip) force. This control scheme has been implemented and tested on the Shadow motor robot hand. An application of this control scheme has also been implemented for two fingers holding and rotating an object around the vertical axis. This experiment shows the strong potential of this force control algorithm for grasping and dexterous manipulation activities.",

Based on the presented analysis, we propose a control approach for the whole system. The partial decoupling between helicopter and arm \u2014 which eliminates the phase circles \u2014 is achieved by means of special movement of robotic arm utilizing its redundant DoF. For the underlying arm control a specially designed impedance controller was proposed. In different flight experiments we showcase that the proposed kind of system type might be used in the future for practically relevant tasks.

Previous work by the group introduced a lateral line inspired feedforward design for underwater vehicle control. The system utilizes pressure sensor arrays to estimate the hydrodynamic force acting on the vehicle such that the additional information will simplify the modeling process and improve the maneuvering accuracy for the control tasks in underwater exploration and environmental monitoring. In this paper, the feedforward control design is presented and tested in simulation for trajectory tracking and path following after expressing the force estimation algorithm in the three-dimensional domain. Pressure measurements at multiple locations on the vehicle surface form a least squares approximation of the pressure distribution. Hydrodynamic forces acting on the vehicle are then estimated and passed to the controller for improved performance. Preliminary experimental tests are conducted to vindicate the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "In this manuscript we propose a robot with a novel kinematics and a novel imaging concept for a transcutaneous ultrasound probe. The underlying goal is to provide a laparoscopic surgeon intraoperative real-time images from within the surgical field without additional man power. The robot is manually controlled by the surgeon through a joystick console. The device is divided into two separate chambers. One is filled with pressurized water and incorporates an transcutaneous ultrasound probe. It is covered with a flexible silicone membrane that is in contact with the patient. The second cavity incorporates the kinematics and is filled with pressurized air. The kinematics has four degrees of freedom (two translational and two rotatory). In this paper, we provide the mathematical description for the direct as well as for the indirect kinematics along with a validation experiment.",

The mechanism, however, has typical disadvantages of losing mobility, falling down, etc. when the robot moves over obstacles or uneven terrains. A novel suspension mechanism presented in this paper was designed to help the robot to overcome these problems. In particular, this mechanism is very suitable for a tall robot, which is susceptible to overturning because of the disturbance caused by acceleration, deceleration, and collision. The proposed mechanism called a Multilayered Suspension Mechanism is composed of the effective and well-directed combination of springs and dampers. It is very simple and cost-effective since it has no actuator for suspension. In this paper, mechanical construction and characteristics of the mechanism are described. Then, excellence and performance of the proposed mechanism are demonstrated by simulations and experiments.",

The main advantage of the gripper is its adaptability to various object shapes and sizes with low DOF. The two DOF gripper takes advantage of two tendon driven trunks. Inspired from the continuum manipulator concept, the trunks do not include discrete joints and rather an elastomer plays the role of the joints. The tendon driven trunks in the first phase of grasping act as rigid links and in the second phase act as flexible mechanisms. Two prototype of the gripper are developed, tested and evaluated. The underactuated prototypes showed a very good adaptability to different object shapes and sizes.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an approach that allows a quadrocopter to follow a person and to recognize simple gestures using an onboard depth camera. This enables novel applications such as hands-free filming and picture taking. The problem of tracking a person with an onboard camera however is highly challenging due to the self-motion of the platform. To overcome this problem, we stabilize the depth image by warping it to a virtual-static camera, using the estimated pose of the quadrocopter obtained from vision and inertial sensors using an Extended Kalman filter. We show that such a stabilized depth video is well suited to use with existing person trackers such as the OpenNI tracker. Using this approach, the quadrocopter not only obtains the position and orientation of the tracked person, but also the full body pose \u2014 which can then for example be used to recognize hand gestures to control the quadrocopter's behaviour. We implemented a small set of example commands (\u201cfollow me\u201d, \u201ctake picture\u201d, \u201cland\u201d), and generate corresponding motion commands. We demonstrate the practical performance of our approach in an extensive set of experiments with a quadrocopter. Although our current system is limited to indoor environments and small motions due to the restrictions of the used depth sensor, it indicates that there is large potential for such applications in the near future.",

        "abstract": "Soft actuators are found throughout nature from elephant trunks to round worms, demonstrating large specific forces without the need for sliding components. These actuators offer impact resilience, human-safe interaction, versatility of motion, and scalability in size. Biological structures often use a fiber-reinforcement around a fluid filled elastomeric enclosure, in which the elastomeric material will capture the distributed pressure and transfer it to the fibers, which will in turn direct the forces to the ends. We previously discovered an entire domain of fiber-reinforced elastomeric enclosures (FREEs), of which McKibben actuators are a small subset. The range of forces and moments possible with FREEs has not been previously investigated. 45 FREE actuators across the span of fiber angle configurations were fabricated and tested. The reaction force and moment of each actuator was determined across a gamut of pressures. Analytical models were generated using a variety of simplifying assumptions. These models were created to provide a closed form expression that models the force and moment data. The models were compared to the experimental values to determine their fit; this provides an understanding of which simplifying kinematic assumptions best represent the experimental results. Interpolated experimental results and the analytical models are all graphically represented for use as an intuitive design tool.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Cooperatively controlled robots are used in many kinds of applications, including surgical robot applications where the surgeon can guide the robot end effector to a desired position. Often, a 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) force/torque sensor is installed. However, in some cases, the sensor is only used to impose safety thresholds and to support the robot guidance task. In cases where high guidance accuracy is not required, it can be difficult to justify the added cost of a 6 DOF force sensor. One lower-cost solution is to incorporate a joystick or similar input device, but this requires additional hardware and removes the surgeon's hands from direct interaction with the robot end-effector. This paper presents a method for achieving cooperative force control without a force sensor. The method utilizes motor current feedback and uses a calibrated current value for force estimation. The novelty of this method is that it can be applied to non-backdrivable robots. It is implemented on a 2-DOF XY stage and experiments are conducted to demonstrate accuracy and performance on this non-backdrivable robot.",

The system is composed of a wireless miniature camera robot with magnetic pan and tilt capabilities, and an external robotic arm to guide the camera along the abdominal wall. The camera robot is provided with a set of magnets, and a magnetic holder is attached at the end effector of the manipulator. This way, the camera robot can be displaced to obtain additional viewpoints of the abdominal cavity by displacing the external manipulator. The first prototype of the camera robot with an embedded LED lighting system is described. To properly displace the robotic arm over the abdominal wall, a hybrid force-position control has been developed, which includes a torque compensation module in order to obtain an appropriate orientation of the end effector. The contact surface has been assumed to be an elastic model, which stiffness matrix is estimated with a recurrent least squares algorithm. Finally, an in-vitro experiment to validate the control scheme proposed is presented.",

        "abstract": "The small scale of minimally-invasive surgery (MIS) presents significant challenges to developing robust, smart, and dexterous tools for manipulating millimeter and sub-millimeter anatomical structures (vessels, nerves) and surgical equipment (sutures, staples). Robotic MIS systems offer the potential to transform this medical field by enabling precise repair of these miniature tissue structures through the use of teleoperation and haptic feedback. However, this effort is currently limited by the inability to make robust and accurate MIS end effectors with integrated force and contact sensing. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of the novel Pop-Up Book MEMS manufacturing method to fabricate the mechanical and sensing elements of an instrumented MIS grasper. A custom thin-foil strain gage was manufactured in parallel with the mechanical components of the grasper to realize a fully-integrated electromechanical system in a single manufacturing step, removing the need for manual assembly, bonding and alignment. In preliminary experiments, the integrated grasper is capable of resolving forces as low as 30 mN, with a sensitivity of approximately 408 mV/N. This level of performance will enable robotic surgical systems that can handle delicate tissue structures and perform dexterous procedures through the use of haptic feedback guidance.",

        "abstract": "Advanced tactile tools in minimally invasive surgery have become a pressing need in order to reduce time and improve accuracy in localizing potential tissue abnormalities. In this regard, one of the main challenges is to be able to estimate tissue parameters in real time. In palpation, tactile information felt at a given location is identified by the viscoelastic dynamics of the neighboring tissue. Due to this reason the tissue examination behavior and the distribution of viscoelastic parameters in tissue should be considered in conjunction. This paper investigates the salient features of palpation behavior on soft tissue determining the effectiveness of localizing hard nodules. Experimental studies involving human participants, and validation tests using finite element simulations and a tele-manipulator, were carried out. Two distinctive tissue examination strategies in force-velocity modulation for the given properties of target tissue were found. Experimental results suggest that force-velocity modulations during continuous path measurements are playing an important role in the process of mechanical soft tissue examination. These behavioral insights, validated by detailed numerical models and robotic experimentations shed light on future designs of optimal robotic palpation.",

        "abstract": "In recent studies, it has been revealed that robots can form concepts and understand the meanings of words through inference. The key idea underlying these studies is \u201cmultimodal categorization\u201d of a robot's experience. However, previous studies considered only nonhierarchical categorization methods, which led to nonhierarchical concept structures. Our concepts have a hierarchical structure, thus ensuring that the resulting inferences are more efficient and accurate. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical categorization method. The method involves extending multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation (MLDA) to hierarchical MLDA using the nested Chinese restaurant process, which makes it possible for robots to acquire concepts in a hierarchical structure. We show that a robot can form a hierarchical concept structure based on self-obtained multimodal information. Moreover, by focusing on the common features of each category in the hierarchy, the robot is able to infer unobserved information including word meanings.",

In order to avoid object deformations in cooperative manipulation, formation rigidity of the robots is desired. This work proposes a novel linear state feedback controller that combines both optimal goal regulation and a relaxed form of the formation rigidity constraint, exploiting an underlying distributed impedance control scheme. Since the presented control design problem is in a biquadratic LQR-like form, we present an iterative design algorithm to compute the controller. As an intermediate result, an approximated state-space model of an interconnected robot system is derived. The controller design approach is evaluated in a full-scale multi-robot experiment.",

        "abstract": "We are interested in forming a multi-robot team that attains high utility at a task, and is robust to failures in the robots. We consider configurable robots that are composed of modules, e.g., motors, sensors, and actuators, where each module has an independent probability of failure. The performance of the multi-robot team at the task depends not only on how the robots in the team are composed from modules, but also the probability of failure of the selected modules. We formally define the robust team formation problem, and introduce two methods of defining the optimal team. We contribute the Robust Synergy Graph for Configurable Robots (\u03c1-SGraCR) model, and two team formation algorithms to find effective robust teams. The first algorithm, OptRobust, runs in exponential time and finds the optimal robust team. The second algorithm, ApproxRobust, makes assumptions about the module failures and approximates the optimal robust team, and runs in polynomial time. We demonstrate the efficacy of the \u03c1-SGraCR model in modeling robust team performance, and evaluate ApproxRobust and OptRobust. Finally, we apply the \u03c1-SGraCR model to a real robot problem in the foraging domain, and show that it outperforms competing approaches.",

An experimental study is performed using a haptic interface that is interacted with a virtual environment through the communication network.

        "abstract": "In sampling-based motion planning algorithms the initial step at every iteration is to generate a new sample from the obstacle-free portion of the configuration space. This is usually accomplished via rejection sampling, i.e., repeatedly drawing points from the entire space until an obstacle-free point is found. This strategy is rarely questioned because the extra work associated with sampling (and then rejecting) useless points contributes at most a constant factor to the planning algorithm's asymptotic runtime complexity. However, this constant factor can be quite large in practice. We propose an alternative approach that enables sampling from a distribution that provably converges to a uniform distribution over only the obstacle-free space. Our method works by storing empirically observed estimates of obstacle-free space in a point-proximity data structure, and then using this information to generate future samples. Both theoretical and experimental results validate our approach.",

        "abstract": "The paper presents a new concept of locomotion for wheeled or legged robots through an object-free space. The concept is inspired by the behaviour of spiders forming silk threads to move in 3D space. The approach provides the possibility of variation in thread diameter by deforming source material, therefore it is useful for a wider coverage of payload by mobile robots. As a case study, we propose a technology for descending locomotion through a free space with inverted formation of threads in variable diameters. Inverted thread formation is enabled with source material thermoplastic adhesive (TPA) through thermally-induced phase transition. To demonstrate the feasibility of the technology, we have designed and prototyped a 300-gram wheeled robot that can supply and deform TPA into a thread and descend with the thread from an existing hanging structure. Experiment results suggest repeatable inverted thread formation with a diameter range of 1.1\u20134.5 mm, and a locomotion speed of 0.73 cm per minute with a power consumption of 2.5 W.",

        "abstract": "We propose a new concept called friction sensitivity which measures how susceptible a specific grasp is to changes in the underlying friction coefficients. We develop algorithms for the synthesis of stable grasps with low friction sensitivity and for the synthesis of stable grasps in the case of small friction coefficients. We describe how grasps with low friction sensitivity can be used when a robot has an uncertain belief about friction coefficients and study the statistics of grasp quality under changes in those coefficients. We also provide a parametric estimate for the distribution of grasp qualities and friction sensitivities for a uniformly sampled set of grasps.",

        "abstract": "We propose a robust and fast solution for the inverse kinematic problem of general serial manipulators - i.e. any number and any combination of revolute and prismatic joints. The algorithm only requires the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) representation of the robot as input and no training or robot-dependent optimization function is needed. In order to handle singularities and to overcome the possibility of multiple paths in redundant robots, our approach relies on the computation of multiple (parallel) numerical estimations of the inverse Jacobian while it selects the current best path to the desire configuration of the end-effector. But unlike other iterative methods, our method achieves sub-millimeter accuracy in 20.48ms in average. The algorithm was implemented in C/C++ using 16 POSIX threads, and it can be easily expanded to use more threads and/or many-core GPUs. We demonstrate the high accuracy and the real-time performance of our method by testing it with five different robots, at both non-singular and singular configurations, including a 7-DoF redundant robot.",

The functional analysis of grasping motion provides an effective representation of grasping motion and emphasizes motion dynamic features that are omitted by classic PCA-based approaches. The proposed approach represents, processes, and compares grasping motion trajectories in a low-dimensional space. An experiment was conducted to record grasping motion trajectories of 15 different grasp types in Cutkosky grasp taxonomy. We implemented our method for the analysis of collected grasping motion in the PCA+fPCA space, which generated a new data-driven taxonomy of the grasp types, and naturally clustered grasping motion into 5 consistent groups across 5 different subjects. The robustness of the grouping was evaluated and confirmed using a tenfold cross validation approach.",

In scenarios such as Urban Search and Rescue, motion encoders can be highly inaccurate, and weight and battery requirements often limit computing power. We have developed a GPU based algorithm using Iterative Closest Point position tracking and Graph SLAM that can accurately generate a map of an unknown environment without the need for motion encoders and requiring minimal computational resources. The algorithm is able to correct for drift in the position tracking by rapidly identifying loops and optimising the map. We present a method for refining the existing map when revisiting areas to increase the accuracy of the existing map and bound the run-time to the size of the environment.",

        "abstract": "The design of efficient locomotion gaits for robots with many degrees of freedom is challenging and time consuming even if optimization techniques are applied. Control parameters can be found through optimization in two ways: (i) through online optimization where the performance of a robot is measured while trying different control parameters on the actual hardware and (ii) through offline optimization by simulating the robot's behavior with the help of models of the robot and its environment. In this paper, we present a hybrid optimization method that combines the best properties of online and offline optimization to efficiently find locomotion gaits for arbitrary structures. In comparison to pure online optimization, both the number of experiments using robotic hardware as well as the total time required for finding efficient locomotion gaits get highly reduced by running the major part of the optimization process in simulation using a cluster of processors. The presented example shows that even for robots with a low number of degrees of freedom the time required for optimization can be reduced by a factor of 2.5 to 30, at least, depending on how extensive the search for optimized control parameters should be. Time for hardware experiments becomes minimal. More importantly, gaits that can possibly damage the robotic hardware can be filtered before being tried in hardware. Yet in contrast to pure offline optimization, we reach well matched behavior that allows a direct transfer of locomotion gaits from simulation to hardware. This is because through a meta-optimization we adapt not only the locomotion parameters but also the parameters for simulation models of the robot and environment allowing for a good matching of the robot behavior in simulation and hardware. We validate the proposed hybrid optimization method on a structure composed of two Roombots modules with a total number of six degrees of freedom.

The method offers a natural and seamless communication channel between the surgeon and the robotic laparoscope. It offers several advantages in terms of reducing on-screen clutter and efficiently conveying visual intention. The proposed hands-free system enables the surgeon to be part of the robot control feedback loop, allowing user-friendly camera panning and zooming. The proposed platform avoids the limitations of using dwell-time camera control in previous gaze contingent camera control methods. The system represents a true hands-free setup without the need of obtrusive sensors mounted on the surgeon or the use of a foot pedal. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were used for real-time gaze gesture recognition. This method was evaluated with a cohort of 11 subjects by using the proposed system to complete a modified upper gastrointestinal staging laparoscopy and biopsy task on a phantom box trainer, with results demonstrating the potential clinical value of the proposed system.",

        "abstract": "In brain-machine interface (BMI) prosthetic systems, recordings of brain activity are used to control external devices such as computers or robots. BMI systems that have shown the highest fidelity of control use neural signals recorded directly from microelectrodes in the brain to control upper-limb prostheses. These have progressed from allowing control of 2 and 3 dimensional movement of a cursor on a computer screen [1], [2] to control of robot arms in first four [3], [4] and more recently seven degrees-of-freedom (DoF) (Fig. 1) [5], [6]. These types of systems require methods to train users to control large numbers of DoF simultaneously. In this paper we present a new method for shared-control guidance. This method of \"Positive-Span\" Virtual Fixturing extends the concept of Virtual Fixtures to guide both translational and rotational DoF of a brain-controlled robot hand toward whole sets of robot poses that would allow an object to be grasped. This system was used to successfully train monkeys to operate the 7-DoF BMI [5], leading directly to the simplified system of \"ortho-impedance\" used to guide human subject BMI control in a similar experiment [6].",

A method for computing feasible robot trajectories for grasping a target with known geometry in a useful time is presented, based on nonlinear optimization and a look-up table. An off-line computation provides a data base for a mapping between a four-dimensional input space, to characterize the target motion, and an N-dimensional output space, representing the family of time-parameterized optimal robot trajectories. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the data base for computing grasping maneuvers in a useful time, for a sample range of spinning motions. The debris object consists of a satellite with solar appendages in Low Earth Orbit, which presents collision avoidance and timing challenges for executing the task.",

We confirmed not only that using higher-order N-grams improves precision in generating long sentences but also that the computational complexity of the proposed system is almost the same as our previous one. In addition, we improved the precision by aligning the graph structure representing generated sentences into confusion network form. This means that simplifying and compacting word sequences affect the precision of sentence generation.",

These diverse paths have the following properties: 1) They are bounded in length and 2) They are non-visibility-deformable into one another. Maintaining multiple path alternatives is important in practical applications such as planning in dynamic environments, in which a path may unexpectedly become infeasible due to unforeseen environmental changes. We present our approach, the distance cost considered (based on the path deformability concept previously introduced in [11]) and finally show results of simulated experiments that exemplify the effectiveness of our algorithm.",

The person can be viewed as an optimal controller that plans the path minimizing a certain (unknown) cost function. Taking this viewpoint, the problem can be formulated as an inverse optimal control one, i.e., starting from control and state trajectories we want to figure out the cost function used by a person while planning the path. To test the envisaged ideas, a set of walking paths of different volunteers were recorded using a motion capture facility. The collected data have been used to compare a solution to the inverse control problem coming from the literature to a novel one. The obtained results, ranked using the discrete Fr\u00e9chet distance, show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Our emphasis is on direct lag-free joint angular acceleration sensing, for which a novel multi-MEMS configuration is motivated by motion control requirements. By using the multi-MEMS configuration, the bandwidth of the angular acceleration sensed is mostly proportional to the physical distances of linear accelerometers. The related joint position sensing, which is robust against linear and angular motion, is founded on the complementary and Kalman filtering principles for exclusive low delay. Experiments on a robotic vertically mounted three-link planar arm demonstrate the advantage of our key theoretical finding.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the global identification of spring balancer, dynamic parameters and joint drive gains of a 6 Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) robot is performed. Off-line identification method is based on the use of the Inverse Dynamic Identification Model (IDIM) which takes into account a spring balancer for gravity compensation and linear Least Squares (LS) technique to estimate the parameters from the positions and joint torques. It is key to get accurate values of joint drive gains to get accurate identification because the joint torques are calculated as the product of the current reference by the joint drive gains. Recently a new method validated on small payload robots (less than 10 Kg) allows to identify simultaneously all joint drive gains and dynamic parameters. This method is based on the Total Least Squares (TLS) solution of an over-determined linear system obtained with the inverse dynamic model calculated while the robot is tracking reference trajectories without load and trajectories with a known payload fixed on the robot. This method is used to identify accurately the heavy industrial robot Kuka KR270 (270Kg payload) with its spring balancer. This is a new step to promote a practical and easy to use method for global dynamic identification of any small or heavy gravity compensated industrial robots that does not need any a priori data, which are too often missing from manufacturer's data sheet.",

        "abstract": "Due to pose uncertainty, merely executing a planned-to-be stable grasp usually results in an unstable grasp in the physical world. In our previous work [1], we proposed a tactile experience based grasping pipeline which utilizes tactile feedback to adjust hand posture during the grasping task of known objects and improves the performance of robotic grasping under pose uncertainty. In this paper, we extend our work to grasp novel objects by utilizing local geometric similarity. To do this, we select a series of shape primitives to parameterize potential local geometries which novel objects may share in common. We then build a tactile experience database that stores information of stable grasps on these local geometries. Using this tactile experience database, our method is able to guide a grasp adjustment process to grasp novel objects around similar local geometries. Experiments indicate that our approach improves the grasping performance on novel objects with similar local geometries under pose uncertainty.",

The approach is based on the iterative exploration of the equilibrium manifold of the system and the quasi-static analysis of the governing equations. As a result, the method can cope with large commanded variations of the grasp stiffness with respect to an initial configuration. Two numerical examples are illustrated. In the first one, a simple 2D hand is analyzed so that the obtained results can be easily verified and discussed. In the second one, to show the method at work in a more realistic scenario, we model grasp compliance regulation for a DLR/HIT hand II grasping a ball.",

Our local motion planner is based on the concept of potential field and composed of the attractive and repulsive vectors. Then, the local motion planner decides the potential vector according to the attractive and repulsive vectors in various situations. Also, an approach to deal with the drawback of local minima is contained. The attractive and repulsive vectors are generated by the distances between the target, obstacles and the manipulator. For robot control, we take the end-effector as the control point and apply the potential vector with joint-level control, and moreover evaluate the mobility and the kinematic constraints of the robot to modify the joint velocities. The experiment platform is a wheeled mobile robot with a 5-DOF manipulator using Softkinetic DS325 which is a close range RGB-D camera as our sensor. Through several experiments, the results show that our framework is fast enough and valid to grasp the object in dynamic environments.",

In this paper, we present an approach to grasping unknown objects that explicitly considers the effect of shape adaptability to simplify perception. Shape adaptation also occurs between the hand and the environment, for example, when fingers slide across the surface of the table to pick up a small object. Our approach to grasping also considers environmental shape adaptability to select grasps with high probability of success. We validate the proposed shape-adaptability-aware grasping approach in 880 real-world grasping trials with 30 objects. Our experiments show that the explicit consideration of shape adaptability of the hand leads to robust grasping of unknown objects. Simple perception suffices to achieve this robust grasping behavior.",

        "abstract": "We propose a system for human-robot interaction that learns both models for spatial prepositions and for object recognition. Our system grounds the meaning of an input sentence in terms of visual percepts coming from the robot's sensors in order to send an appropriate command to the PR2 or respond to spatial queries. To perform this grounding, the system recognizes the objects in the scene, determines which spatial relations hold between those objects, and semantically parses the input sentence. The proposed system uses the visual and spatial information in conjunction with the semantic parse to interpret statements that refer to objects (nouns), their spatial relationships (prepositions), and to execute commands (actions). The semantic parse is inherently compositional, allowing the robot to understand complex commands that refer to multiple objects and relations such as: \u201cMove the cup close to the robot to the area in front of the plate and behind the tea box\u201d. Our system correctly parses 94% of the 210 online test sentences, correctly interprets 91% of the correctly parsed sentences, and correctly executes 89% of the correctly interpreted sentences.",

        "abstract": "Machine perception often requires a large amount of user-annotated data which is time-consuming, difficult, or expensive to collect. Perception systems should be easy to train by regular users, and this is currently far from the case. Our previous work, tracking-based semi-supervised learning [14], helped reduce the labeling burden by using tracking information to harvest new and useful training examples. However, [14] was designed for offline use; it assumed a fixed amount of unlabeled data and did not allow for corrections from users. In many practical robot perception scenarios we A) desire continuous learning over a long period of time, B) have a stream of unlabeled sensor data available rather than a fixed dataset, and C) are willing to periodically provide a small number of new training examples. In light of this, we present group induction, a new mathematical framework that rigorously encodes the intuition of [14] in an alternating optimization problem similar to expectation maximization (EM), but with the assumption that the unlabeled data comes in groups of instances that share the same hidden label. The mathematics suggest several improvements to the original heuristic algorithm, and make clear how to handle user interaction and streams of unlabeled data. We evaluate group induction on a track classification task from natural street scenes, demonstrating its ability to learn continuously, adapt to user feedback, and accurately recognize objects of interest.",

        "abstract": "We propose HRA*, a new randomized path planner for complex 3D environments. The method is a modified A* algorithm that uses a hybrid node expansion technique that combines a random exploration of the action space meeting vehicle kinematic constraints with a cost to goal metric that considers only kinematically feasible paths to the goal. The method includes also a series of heuristics to accelerate the search time. These include a cost penalty near obstacles, and a filter to prevent revisiting configurations. The performance of the method is compared against A*, RRT and RRT* in a series of challenging 3D outdoor datasets. HRA* is shown to outperform all of them in computation time, and delivering shorter paths than A* and RRT.",

        "abstract": "Extending our previous work in real-time vision-based Human Robot Interaction (HRI) with multi-robot systems, we present the first example of creating, modifying and commanding teams of UAVs by an uninstrumented human. To create a team the user focuses attention on an individual robot by simply looking at it, then adds or removes it from the current team with a motion-based hand gesture. Another gesture commands the entire team to begin task execution. Robots communicate among themselves by wireless network to ensure that no more than one robot is focused, and so that the whole team agrees that it has been commanded. Since robots can be added and removed from the team, the system is robust to incorrect additions. A series of trials with two and three very low-cost UAVs and off-board processing demonstrates the practicality of our approach.",

Here, we obtained detailed psychophysical characteristics of perceived force-magnitude in multiple degrees of freedom (MDOF) using multi-point suction pressure stimuli. To obtain such data, we developed a multi-point stimulation method that can represent MDOF perceived force on a tool. We characterized the perceived force response of human subjects to suction pressure stimuli through psychophysical experiments. Moreover, we analyzed the strain energy density (SED) on the finger pads considering the force applied through finite element simulation. The results of the psychophysical experiments showed that multi-point stimulation method is effective for evoking MDOF perceived force on a tool. Interestingly, we found that the results of the finite element analysis agree with those of the psychophysical data. Therefore, we have verified that it is possible to use multi-point suction pressure stimulation for representing perceived force on objects held in a hand. In addition, a preliminary insight into the role of SED for perceiving force on tools is provided.",

        "abstract": "A haptic device using flexible sheet is developed. This device elongates a rubber sheet with four servo motors in parallel. Controlling their motor angles varies softness of the sheet: stretched sheet feels hard, and loose sheet feels soft. Hence a user can feel different softness of virtual objects when he pushes the sheet directly with his finger. We apply this device to haptic feedback of real soft objects. The system consists of the haptic device and a robot with a pressure sensing device. This sensing device is a rubber hemisphere filled with air. The internal pressure is measured when the hemisphere is pressed against an object. First a user pushes the center of the sheet. The movement of the side edge of the sheet is observed with a close-up camera, and the user's pushing pressure on the sheet is estimated. Next the robot pushes a target object so that its pushing pressure on the object, which is measured with the pressure sensing device, may coincide with the user's pushing pressure on the sheet. At the same time, the softness of the object is estimated from the measured pushing pressure on the object and the indentation of the object, which is given by the robot's movement. Then the haptic device controls the motor angles so that the sheet's softness may be equal to the object's softness. The system repeats this process in real time. In this way the user feels the same softness as the real object by pushing the sheet. As an experimental result, the developed haptic device can imitate softness of a real stuffed doll.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The dynamic response of deformable bodies varies significantly in dependence on mechanical properties of the objects: while the dynamics of a stiff and light object (e. g. wire or needle) involves high-frequency phenomena such as vibrations, much lower frequencies are sufficient for capturing the dynamic response of an object composed of a soft tissue. Yet, when simulating mechanical interactions between soft and stiff deformable models, a single time-step in the time integration is usually employed to compute the dynamics of both objects. However, this can be a serious issue when the haptic rendering of complex scenes composed of various bodies is considered. In this paper, we present a novel method allowing for the haptic simulation of a scene composed of colliding objects modeled at different frequencies: typically, the dynamics of soft objects is calculated at a frequency of about 50Hz, while the dynamics of stiff object is simulated at 1 kHz, being directly connected to the computation of the haptic force feedback. The collision response is performed at both low and high frequencies employing data structures which describe the actual constraints and are shared between the high and low frequency loops. We show that during the simulation we show that the objects behave according to two mechanical principles: non-inter-penetration and action-reaction principles. Examples showing the scenes involving different bodies in interaction are given, demonstrating the benefits of the proposed method.",

The exploration is modeled as an Integer Programming (IP) optimization problem and the allocation of the vehicles(agents) to frontier locations is modeled using binary variables. The formulation is also studied for distributed system, where agents are divided into multiple teams using graph partitioning. Optimization seamlessly integrates several practical constraints that arise in exploration between such heterogeneous agents and provides an elegant solution for assigning task to agents. We have also presented comparison with previous methods based on distance traversed and computational time to signify advantages of presented method. We also show practical realization of such an exploration where an UGV-MAV team efficiently builds a map of an indoor environment.",

        "abstract": "We propose a map merging algorithm that is capable of merging together heterogeneous maps independently built by different robots. Heterogeneous map merging is a crucially important problem for scenarios where multiple heterogeneous robots collaborate to provide situational awareness in urban search and rescue, patrolling, and explorations tasks, just to name a few. To remedy the lack of uniform representation between heterogeneous map models, we rely on the ubiquitous presence of WiFi signals in today's environments. Our solution consists of three steps. First, the overlap between the heterogeneous maps being merged is determined. Second, metric correspondences between overlapping parts are established. Third, the merging is improved by exploiting the structural properties inherent to graph-based maps. Our proposed system is validated using various occupancy grid and appearance-based maps built in real-world conditions, the results of which confirm its strengths. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solution to the heterogeneous map merging problem.",

        "abstract": "The effect of ocean flow on the motion of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) is often crucial in the development of underwater localization algorithms and should not be treated as small disturbances. The domination of strong ocean currents and the requirement of low power consumption prohibit AUVs to move against a background flow to obtain localization correction in a timely manner. Our recent studies, among others, enable an unmanned vehicle to follow a near optimal trajectory found by Lagrangian coherent structures based fluid control algorithm with minimal fuel usage, which improves the vehicles' runtime and the path following accuracy in the presence of strong background flow. Here, we propose a three-dimensional fully distributed localization hierarchy to improve the localization of low-cost mobile marine data collection underwater sensor networks using intra-vehicle communication and measurements. The proposed algorithm is realized by using the extended Kalman filter. Correlation terms in covariance matrices are considered independently to meet the distributed feature. Resulting simulated localization errors are bounded at satisfactory levels and the relationship between the number of AUVs and the performance of the algorithm is investigated.",

Omnidirectional images acquired by the robot are organized as places which are represented as nodes in the topological graph/map. Places are regions in the environment over which the global scene appearance of all acquired images is consistent. A hierarchical loop closure algorithm is proposed which quickly sifts through the places to retrieve the most similar places and another level of thorough similarity analysis is performed over the images belonging to the retrieved places. An Image similarity metric based on spatial shift of local image features across omnidirectional/panoramic image pairs is proposed. Newly proposed VLAD (Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors) descriptors have been used for loop closure at place and image levels. Accuracy and efficiency of our system are corroborated with experimental results on three publicly available datasets. It is shown that our approach achieves good loop closure recall rates even without using epi-polar geometry verification common among many other approaches.",

The algorithm has three major improvements, which can be implemented in practical applications; Firstly high-accuracy pose estimation by using stereo cameras, secondly real time implementation issues with non-real-time image processing platform and thirdly a consideration for industrial position controller. To resolve the issues, position-based visual servoing (PBVS) is adopted and appearance model based virtual visual servoing (VVS) is applied for pose estimation. VVS approach does not compute the stereo matching but directly compares the OpenGL rendered image and camera image for each camera; estimate the position/orientation using VVS independently for each camera; and provides a theoretically optimal compromise among those estimates. To enhance estimation accuracy, a hybrid method of stereo trigonometry for position estimation and weighted least squares for orientation estimation is proposed to combine the information from the stereo cameras. Operation speed is increased by using graphic processing unit (GPU) acceleration and an on-line trajectory generator which can accommodate the variable cycle of the image processing and the fixed cycle of a common robot controller. Finally, some experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

In order to achieve the high throughput measurement of cellular mechacal properties, we proposed the robot integrated microfluidic chip (robochip), taking advantages of both of micromechanical manipulator and Lab-on-a-Chip devices. The robochip contained a pair of a magnetically driven on-chip robotic probe and a force sensor. The characterization system based on the robochip performed by the visual feedback control, and the continuous cell measurement was demonstrated. The throughput of our system was 15 to 20 seconds per one oocyte. Moreover, the measurement of the viscoelastic properties were demonstrated as a quality evaluation of oocyte. Experimental results shows that the oocyte has the viscoelastic properties among the same culture condition, and it is important to analyze the mechanical properties of oocyte for the evaluation of the quality. From these results, we concluded that the high through put cellular mechanical characterization was achieved, and our robochip approach was a promising technique for a cellular characterization because the chip part was disposable.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents new methods to control highspeed running in a simulated humanoid robot at speeds of up to 6.5 m/s. We present methods to generate compliant target CoM dynamics through the use of a 3D spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) template model. A nonlinear least-squares optimizer is used to find periodic trajectories of the 3D-SLIP offline, while a local deadbeat SLIP controller provides reference CoM dynamics online at real-time rates to correct for tracking errors and disturbances. The local deadbeat controller employs common foot placement strategies that are automatically generated by a local analysis of the 3D-SLIP apex return map. A task-space controller is then applied online to select whole-body joint torques which embed these target dynamics into the humanoid. Despite the body of work on the 2D and 3D-SLIP models, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that a SLIP model has been embedded into a whole-body humanoid model. When running at 3.5 m/s, the controller is shown to reject lateral disturbances of 40 N\u00b7s applied at the waist. A final demonstration shows the capability of the controller to stabilize running at 6.5 m/s, which is comparable with the speed of an Olympian in the 5000 meter run.",

Limit cycle walkers achieving energy-efficient walking have been developed in the last decade. Many researchers have recently studied methods for improving walking speed of limit cycle walkers. In human walking, humans swing their arms according to walking phases and the motion is a regularly symmetric motion about the torso. We consider that this motion is an active up-and-down motion for a mass and improves biped walking speed. We numerically and mathematically show that a biped robot achieves fast limit cycle walking by the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Soft and continuum robots have the useful capability of adopting intricate postures and conforming to complex shapes. Furthermore, structures built from soft materials propagate mechanical energy from one part of the body to another, depending on its body shape, boundary condition, stiffness distribution, and so on. This makes the robots capable of producing a large number of force profiles to achieve useful behaviors and functionalities, even using a small number of actuators. Exploiting the soft mechanical property also enables to generate functional frictional forces, which is a key issue in controlling robot locomotion. In this paper, a highly deformable 3-D printed soft robot (PS robot) is presented, which is capable of generating complex, robust gaits on different inclines using a novel variable friction leg design. This design changes the frictional force depending on the robot posture and shape to facilitate robot locomotion. Shape memory alloy (SMA) coils are embedded into the robot in such a way that they act both as structural elements and actuators. This is the first soft robot platform produced by 3-D printing making fabrication simple and fast.",

        "abstract": "Caging can offer robustness to uncertainties in grasping. If a robotic hand is designed based on the idea of caging, it would probably work well with noisy perception devices and low-quality control. This paper takes into account these merits and designs and implements a gripping hand based on the idea of caging. The gripping hand is concise and offers a low-cost alternative to co-operate with noisy data and low-quality control. According to previous work, we need four fingers to cage any 2D objects. That is to say, if each finger has one, two or three degree of freedoms, we will totally need four, eight or twelve actuators. The large number of actuators would be costly. This paper simplify the number of actuators into one by quantitatively analyzing finger formations with caging tests conducted on both random objects and objects from MPEG-7 shape database. It successfully lowers costs while maintains high performance. Following the simplified one-actuator design we implement a gripping hand by modifying a SCHUNK RH707 hand and carried out experiments with a manipulator built on the Neuronics Katana arm. The one-actuator gripping hand could work well with common depth cameras (Swiss Ranger) and pick up various objects. It bridges the gap between caging theories and applications and demonstrates the merits of caging.",

In this paper, a practical multi-user teleoperation system is proposed for monitoring, inspection, operation, and maintenance of the unmanned offshore plants. The proposed system is developed to control mobile manipulator in a cooperative way among multiple human operators for better performance. For this, two control schemes, hand-eye coordination and disjoint axes were introduced for easier intuitive control of the mobile manipulator and for better cooperative control among multi-user, respectively. A well-known passivity-based approach, the time-domain passivity approach was, in addition, adopted to maintain system stability. And then, the proposed multi-user teleoperation system was evaluated via a human-centered method with several quantitative metrics regarding task completion time and interaction forces. Experimental results showed that the proposed multi-user teleoperation system has the benefit in tasks requiring less task completion time and interaction forces.",

In our approach we first extract information from users preference related to comfort while sitting on a robotic wheelchair under different conditions in an indoor corridor environment. Human-comfort factors are integrated to a geometric map generated by SLAM framework. Then a global planner computes a safe and comfortable path which is followed by the robotic wheelchair. Finally, an evaluation with 29 participants using a fully autonomous robotic wheelchair, showed that more than 90% of them found the proposed approach more comfortable than a shortest-path state of the art approach.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a first step is taken towards using vision in human-humanoid haptic joint actions. Haptic joint actions are characterized by physical interaction throughout the execution of a common goal. Because of this, most of the focus is on the use of force/torque-based control. However, force/torque information is not rich enough for some tasks. Here, a particular case is shown: height stabilization during table carrying. To achieve this, a visual servoing controller is used to generate a reference trajectory for the impedance controller. The control law design is fully described along with important considerations for the vision algorithm and a framework to make pose estimation robust during the table carrying task of the humanoid robot. We then demonstrate all this by an experiment where a human and the HRP-2 humanoid jointly transport a beam using combined force and vision data to adjust the interaction impedance while at the same time keeping the inclination of the beam horizontal.",

This paper describes a project to build a robot chemical sensing system based on observations of airflow around the human body. These observations indicate that in low-velocity airflow air warmed by body heat rises and carries odorants from near ground level towards the nose. This implies that under the right conditions large areas of the human body act to collect and direct odour chemicals to the nose. The aim of this project is to investigate the feasibility of this odour collection mechanism by building a robotic odour sensing system working on this principle and to compare it with the same chemical sensor system when not heated. The results indicate the improved sensitivity of the heated sensor system. This paper describes the sensor system and gives results of sensor tests and odour source location experiments performed using it.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a framework that allows a human and a robot to perform simultaneous manipulation tasks safely in close proximity. The proposed framework is based on early prediction of the human's motion. The prediction system, which builds on previous work in the area of gesture recognition, generates a prediction of human workspace occupancy by computing the swept volume of learned human motion trajectories. The motion planner then plans robot trajectories that minimize a penetration cost in the human workspace occupancy while interleaving planning and execution. Multiple plans are computed in parallel, one for each robot task available at the current time, and the trajectory with the least cost is selected for execution. We test our framework in simulation using recorded human motions and a simulated PR2 robot. Our results show that our framework enables the robot to avoid the human while still accomplishing the robot's task, even in cases where the initial prediction of the human's motion is incorrect. We also show that taking into account the predicted human workspace occupancy in the robot's motion planner leads to safer and more efficient interactions between the user and the robot than only considering the human's current configuration.",

To correct this problem, this paper proposes a method in which a robot observes its own posture in a mirror. This method does not need an additional time-consuming setup, such as calibration of external cameras. We attach a reference point to a known position on the robot body. By observing markers and the reference point in the same view, we can estimate the position of the markers accurately based on the geometric relationship between the mirror, an object, and its mirror reflection. We evaluate the proposed method by experiments of measuring and correcting the posture of an actual robot body to attain the target posture.",

We also elucidate the internal dynamics (i.e., the dynamics hidden from the tool-tip position and yaw angle output and not directly affected by the control action due to the quadro-tor's underactuation), reveal a (seemingly counter-intuitive) necessary condition for internal stability (i.e., tool above the quadrotor, not beneath it), and propose a stabilizing control action to ensure the angular rates still be bounded while preventing the finite-time escape.

(ii) By observing a single point feature, as well as a single plane of known direction but not perpendicular to gravity, all degrees of freedom of the IMU-RGBD navigation system become observable, up to global translations. Next, based on the results of the observability analysis, we design a consistency-improved, observability-constrained (OC) extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based estimator for the IMU-RGBD camera navigation system.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an identification technique of a human standing controller. The dynamics of a human is approximated by the macroscopic relationship between the center of mass and the zero-moment point. The standing controller is modelled by a piecewise-linear feedback, which was originally developed for humanoid robots. In the previous work, the authors found a qualitative similarity of the model to an actual human behavior observed in a phase space, and the next challenge was to identify the controller from those data. A difficulty is that the observed dynamics is a piecewise system due to the unilaterality of reaction forces, so that the identification is not straightforward. It is not trivial how to detect the switching point in each motion locus and how to find the trust region of the supposed model. The recursive-least-square (RLS) method, which can present the deviation of identified parameters and that of the reliability of the results, helps to estimate the trust region with a returning computation process. Through the identification, the validity of the proposed method was verified. More study about the availability of the COM-ZMP model and the piecewise-linear controller for the analyses of the human standing control is also reported.",

        "abstract": "For any rigid robot, a set of 14 standard parameters characterises the dynamics of each of its links and joints. Only a subset of these standard parameters: the base parameters have unique values identified with the Inverse Dynamic Identification Model and linear least squares techniques (IDIM-LS). Moreover, some of the base parameters are poorly identified when their effect on the joint torques is too small. They can be eliminated, leading to a new subset of essential (base) parameters. However, the consistency of the identified values of the base or the essential parameters cannot be guaranteed, regarding to the loss of the positive definiteness of the robot inertia matrix. The past methods proposed to verify the physical consistency of the identified parameters, relies on complicated, time consuming computations and even leads to non-optimal LS parameters. We propose a method that overcomes these drawbacks, calculating the set of optimal LS standard parameters closest to a set of a priori consistent dynamic parameters obtained through CAD data given by the robot manufacturers. This is a straightforward method, which relies on the use of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the Cholesky factorization and the linear least squares techniques. The method is experimentally validated on a St\u00e4ubli TX-40, which is a 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) industrial robot. This example enlighten a strong result: the essential base parameters, which have significant identified values with respect to their small relative standard deviation, are consistent.",

Without spherical wrists, the singularity analysis and avoidance of these manipulators are very difficult. In this paper, a method is presented to analytically identify its singular configurations based on the elementary transformation of Jacobian matrix. Firstly, we constructed a general kinematics model to describe them in a united manner. Correspondingly, the differential kinematics equation and the modified form are derived. Secondly, the singularity conditions are isolated and collected in a 3\u00d74 sub-matrix by several times row transformation of the modified Jacobian matrix, which is partitioned into a block-triangle matrix. Finally, all the singularity configurations are determined by analyzing the rank degeneracy conditions of the 3\u00d74 sub-matrix. The proposed method isolates the singularity conditions, and collects them in a 3\u00d74 sub-matrix, largely reducing the computation workload.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel vision-based localization and mapping algorithm using image moments of region features. The environment is represented using regions, such as planes and/or 3D objects instead of only a dense set of feature points. The regions can be uniquely defined using a small number of parameters; e.g., a plane can be completely characterized by normal vector and distance to a local coordinate frame attached to the plane. The variation of image moments of the regions in successive images can be related to the parameters of the regions. Instead of tracking a large number of feature points, variations of image moments of regions can be computed by tracking the segmented regions or a few feature points on the objects in successive images. A map represented by regions can be characterized using a minimal set of parameters. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear filtering problem. A new discrete-time nonlinear filter based on the state-dependent coefficient (SDC) form of nonlinear functions is presented. It is shown via Monte-Carlo simulations that the new nonlinear filter is more accurate and consistent than EKF by evaluating the root-mean squared error (RMSE) and normalized estimation error squared (NEES).",

        "abstract": "Multi-robot systems (MRS) are a very active and important research topic nowadays. One of the main problems of these systems is the large number of variables to take into account. Due to this, robot behaviors are sometimes learnt instead of calculated via analytical expressions. A typical learning mechanism, specially for biomimetic robots, is Learning from demonstration (LfD). This paper proposes a LfD approach for implicit coordinated navigation using combination of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) behaviors. During a training stage, CBR is used to learn simple behaviors that associate positions of other robots and/or objects to motion commands for each robot. Thus, human operators only need to concentrate on achieving their robot's goal as efficiently as possible in the operating conditions. Then, in running stage, each robot will achieve a different coordinate navigation strategy depending on the triggered behaviors. This system has been successfully tested with three Aibo-ERS7 robots in a RobCup-like environment.",

The proposed approach fuses data into a consistent frame of reference over time, thus utilizing prior depth measurements and viewpoint information in the noise removal process. The effectiveness of the approach is compared to two state of the art, single-frame denoising methods in the context of feature descriptor matching and keypoint detection stability. To make more general statements about the effect of noise removal in these applications, we extend a method for evaluating local image gradient feature descriptors to the domain of 3D shape descriptors. We perform a comparative study of three classes of such descriptors: Normal Aligned Radial Features, Fast Point Feature Histograms and Depth Kernel Descriptors; and evaluate their performance on a real-world industrial application data set. We demonstrate that noise removal enabled by the dense map representation results in major improvements in matching across all classes of descriptors as well as having a substantial positive impact on keypoint detection reliability.",

However, theoretical results show that in general these problems are as hard as solving partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDPs). We propose an approach where we build plans assuming both the actions and the observations are reliable, then monitor the execution of the plan and use a value of information calculation to add information gathering actions on-line. We describe two variants: one using a classical contingency planner to generate the initial plan, and the other using a Markov decision problem planner. We show how in both cases the addition of execution monitoring can considerably improve overall performance with lower computational cost than solving the original POMDP.",

We propose a novel approach for improving the energy efficiency of AUV controllers based on the ability to learn which external disturbances can safely be ignored. The proposed learning approach uses adaptive oscillators that are able to learn online the frequency, amplitude and phase of zero-mean periodic external disturbances. Such disturbances occur naturally in open water due to waves, currents, and gravity, but also can be caused by the dynamics and hydrodynamics of the AUV itself. We formulate the theoretical basis of the approach, and demonstrate its abilities on a number of input signals. Further experimental evaluation is conducted using a dynamic model of the Girona 500 AUV in simulation on two important underwater scenarios: hovering and trajectory tracking. The proposed approach shows significant energy-saving capabilities while at the same time maintaining high controller gains. The approach is generic and applicable not only for AUV control, but also for other type of control where periodic disturbances exist and could be accounted for by the controller.",

        "abstract": "A novel idea for improving transparency of teleoperation systems with force feedback is presented. This approach is based on the idea of sensory subtraction presented in [12], and consists of providing the operator with independently controlled kinesthetic and cutaneous feedback to improve the realism of haptic rendering of the remote environment (i.e., transparency), while preserving stability. More specifically, cutaneous force feedback is employed to recover transparency when a lack of kinesthetic feedback has to be enforced to keep the teleoperation loop stable. The viability of this approach is demonstrated with two experiments of teleoperated needle insertion. Results showed improved performance with respect to common control techniques not employing the proposed cutaneous compensation.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the property of an impulse force generator based on snap-through buckling of a robotic closed elastic rod which is considered as one of good examples of continuum robots. The impulse force generator considered here utilizes a snap through buckling of an elastic rod where its base end is pinned and driven by a rotary actuator forcibly while the tip end is pinned or clamped to the fixed point. One of the most fundamental design problems is to maximize the released elastic energy at each buckling state subject to limited ranges of driving torque and angle of a given actuator. From this design viewpoint, we show two findings obtained from quasi-static planar shape transition simulation of the closed elastica, which will be useful for a design of the robot, that is, the ratio of the elastica length and the endpoint distance decides 1) the buckling angle which relates to the range of an actuator driving angle, and 2) the released elastic energy per the maximum driving torque. We also provide a mathematical description of snap-through buckling based on which we can measure a distance to a buckling point.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces and compares two control approaches that increase the robustness of humanoid standing balance in the sagittal plane with respect to impulsive perturbations by adapting joint torques. To address the question of how the range of admissible perturbations for an n-link inverted pendulum model can be enlarged, we propose two different strategies: adapting the ankle torque only and adapting all joint torques uniformly. For each, explicit-form solutions exist for nonlinear models with an arbitrary number of links. A Center of Pressure-based criterion for switching between the default feedback controller and the torque reduction strategies is introduced. In a three-link model case study, a wide range of robot poses, which are optimized either for steady state effort minimization or robustness, are considered. Simulation results show that our models are robust to impulse perturbations of between 10% and 149% greater magnitude than for an LQR default control law. However, there is a trade-off between robustness gains and steady-state balancing effort. In a second example, a joint-locked model, which uses an adaptive joint torque reduction strategy, outperforms a joint-unlocked model that only uses the default controller both in terms of robustness and control effort.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new computationally-efficient method for vision-aided navigation (VAN) in autonomous robotic applications. While many VAN approaches are capable of processing incoming visual observations, incorporating loop-closure measurements typically requires performing a bundle adjustment (BA) optimization, that involves both all the past navigation states and the observed 3D points. Our approach extends the incremental light bundle adjustment (LBA) method, recently developed for structure from motion [10], to information fusion in robotics navigation and in particular for including loop-closure information. Since in many robotic applications the prime focus is on navigation rather then mapping, and as opposed to traditional BA, we algebraically eliminate the observed 3D points and do not explicitly estimate them. Computational complexity is further improved by applying incremental inference. To maintain highrate performance over time, consecutive IMU measurements are summarized using a recently-developed technique and navigation states are added to the optimization only at camera rate. If required, the observed 3D points can be reconstructed at any time based on the optimized robot's poses. The proposed method is compared to BA both in terms of accuracy and computational complexity in a statistical simulation study.",

Due to the cost of acquiring such examples, it is desirable to reduce the number of necessary interactions. Transfer learning has been shown to improve classification results for classes with small numbers of training examples by pooling knowledge from related classes. Standard practice in these works is to assume that the relationship between the transfer target and related classes is already known. In this work, we explore how previously learned categories, or related groupings of classes, can be used to transfer knowledge to novel classes without explicitly known relationships to them. We demonstrate an algorithm for determining the category membership of a novel class, focusing on the difficult case when few training examples are available. We show that classifiers trained via this method outperform classifiers optimized to learn the novel class individually when evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets.",

The method is developed based on the observation that multiple locations can be reached by a flexible needle through insertion, partial retraction, rotation, and re-insertion of the needle. We show that in 2D space this problem can be solved using a geometric relationship between multiple tangent circles. Specifically we find a needle insertion point, a corresponding insertion direction and lengths for insertion and retraction with which we can generate the optimal needle trajectory that reaches two or three planar targets with the minimum tissue damage. This minimization problem is solved using exhaustive search of a cost function on the 1D bounded domain. We build a prototype of a needle insertion system and develop C#-based software to compute the optimal needle paths and perform the planned insertion as an open-loop controller. Finally, actual insertion examples are presented.",

        "abstract": "The human understanding of things is based on prediction which is made through concepts formed by the categorization of experience. To mimic this mechanism in robots, multimodal categorization, which enables the robot to form concepts, has been studied. On the other hand, segmentation and categorization of human motions have also been studied to recognize and predict future motions. This paper addresses the issue on how these different kinds of concepts are integrated to generate higher level concepts and, more importantly, on how the higher level concepts affect the formation of each lower level concept. To this end, we propose the multi-layered multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation (mMLDA), which is an expansion of the MLDA to learn and represent the hierarchical structure of concepts. We also examine a simple integration model and compare it with the mMLDA.

Clasping an object enables a rich set of activities such as dragging, toting, pulling and hauling which can be applied to both soft and rigid objects. To this end, we define a virtual linking measure which characterizes the spacial relation between the robot hand and object. The measure utilizes a set of closed curves arising from an approximately shortest basis of the object's first homology group. We define task spaces to perform collision-free motion planing with respect to multiple prioritized objectives using a sampling-based planing method. The approach is tested in simulation using different robot hands and various real-world objects.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an integrated navigation sensor module, including a camera, a laser scanner, and an inertial sensor, for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to fly both indoors and outdoors. The camera and the gimbaled laser sensor work in a complementary manner to extract feature points from the environment around the vehicle. The features are processed using an online extended Kalman filter (EKF) in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm to estimate the navigational states of the vehicle. In this paper, a new method is proposed for calibrating a camera and a gimbaled laser sensor. This calibration method uses a simple visual marker to calibrate the camera and the laser scanner with each other. We also propose a real-time navigation algorithm based on the EKF SLAM algorithm, which is suitable for our camera-laser sensor package. The algorithm merges image features with laser range data for state estimation. Finally, these sensors and algorithms are implemented on our octo-rotor UAV platform and the result shows that our onboard navigation module can provide a real-time three-dimensional navigation solution without any assumptions or prior information on the surroundings.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an integrated navigation system that allows humanoid robots to autonomously navigate in unknown, cluttered environments. From the data of an onboard consumer-grade depth camera, our system estimates the robot's pose to compensate for drift of odometry and maintains a heightmap representation of the environment. Based on this model, our system iteratively computes sequences of safe actions including footsteps and whole-body motions, leading the robot to target locations. Hereby, the planner chooses from a set of actions that consists of planar footsteps, step-over actions, as well as parameterized step-onto and step-down actions. To efficiently check for collisions during planning, we developed a new approach that takes into account the shape of the robot and the obstacles. As we demonstrate in experiments with a Nao humanoid, our system leads to robust navigation in cluttered environments and the robot is able to traverse highly challenging passages.",

With such a problem formulation, which is quite reasonable for many standard operation scenarios, it is intuitively clear that a feedback controller should be designed to achieve orbital stabilization of a time-optimal trajectory instead asymptotic. We propose an algorithm to convert an asymptotically stabilizing controller into an orbitally stabilizing one and check achievable performance in simulations and, more importantly, in experiments performed on a standard industrial robot ABB IRB 140 with the IRC5-system extended with an open control interface. It is verified that the proposed re-design allows significantly reduced deviations of the actual trajectories from the desired one at high speeds not only for a chosen base feedback design but also outperforming the state-of-the-art commercial implementation offered by ABB Robotics.",

        "abstract": "Extensive literature has been written on occupancy grid mapping for different sensors. When stereo vision is applied to the occupancy grid framework it is common, however, to use sensor models that were originally conceived for other sensors such as sonar. Although sonar provides a distance to the nearest obstacle for several directions, stereo has confidence measures available for each distance along each direction. The common approach is to take the highest-confidence distance as the correct one, but such an approach disregards mismatch errors inherent to stereo. In this work, stereo confidence measures of the whole sensed space are explicitly integrated into 3D grids using a new occupancy grid formulation. Confidence measures themselves are used to model uncertainty and their parameters are computed automatically in a maximum likelihood approach. The proposed methodology was evaluated in both simulation and a real-world outdoor dataset which is publicly available. Mapping performance of our approach was compared with a traditional approach and shown to achieve less errors in the reconstruction.",

This method does not explicitly models friction and surface geometry details, but employs a fast feedback loop based on visual and tactile feedback to perform robust manipulation even in the presence of unexpected slippage or rolling. At every control step, fingertip motions are computed to realize the intended object relocation, employing a composite position/force controller. Subsequently inverse hand kinematics is employed to retrieve joint-level motions, which are implemented on the robot with a position servo loop. We evaluate our method on a setup of two KUKA robot arms, each equipped with a tactile sensor array as end-effectors to perform the object manipulation task. The experimental results show the feasibility of our proposed method, even in presence of slippage or external disturbances.",

The number and variety of objects present not only make perception very difficult but also introduce many constraints for robot navigation and manipulation. In this paper, we investigate the idea of exploring a small, bounded environment (e.g., the shelf of a home refrigerator) by prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation of the objects it contains. The presence of multiple objects results in partial and occluded views of the scene. This inherent uncertainty in the scene's state forces the robot to adopt an observe-plan-act strategy and interleave planning with execution. Objects occupying the space and potentially occluding other hidden objects are rearranged to reveal more of the unseen area. The environment is considered explored when the state (free or occupied) of every voxel in the volume is known. The presented algorithm can be easily adapted to real world problems like object search, taking inventory, and mapping. We evaluate our planner in simulation using various metrics like planning time, number of actions required, and length of planning horizon. We then present an implementation on the PR2 robot and use it for object search in clutter.",

It extends passivity-based control framework for haptic teleoperation of aerial vehicles in the longest intercontinental setting that presents great challenges. The practicality of the control architecture has been shown in maneuvering and obstacle-avoidance tasks over the internet with the presence of significant time-varying delays and packet losses. Experimental results are presented for teleoperation of a slave quadrotor in Australia from a master station in the Netherlands. The results show that the remote operator is able to safely maneuver the flying vehicle through a structure using haptic feedback of the state of the slave and the perceived obstacles.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we present a powerful, albeit simple position control approach for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) targeting specifically multicopter systems. Exploiting the differential flatness of four of the six outputs of multicopters, namely position and yaw, we show that the remaining outputs of pitch and roll need not be controlled states, but rather just need to be known. Instead of the common approach of having multiple cascaded control loops (position \u2014 velocity \u2014 acceleration/attitude \u2014 angular rates), the proposed method employs an outer control loop based on dynamic inversion, which directly commands angular rates and thrust. The inner control loop then reduces to a simple proportional controller on the angular rates. As a result, not only does this combination allow for higher bandwidth compared to common control approaches, but also eliminates many mathematical operations (only one trigonometric function is called), speeding up the necessary processing especially on embedded systems. This approach assumes a reliable state estimation framework, which we are able to provide with through previous work. As a result, with this work, we provide the missing elements necessary for a complete approach on autonomous navigation of MAVs.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with a new iterative learning dynamic identification and control method of robot. The robot is closed-loop controlled with a Computed Torque Control (CTC). The parameters of the Inverse Dynamic Model (IDM), which calculates the CTC are calculated to minimize the quadratic error between the actual joint force/torque and a joint force/torque calculated with the Inverse Dynamic Identification Model (IDIM), linear in relation to the parameters. Usually the parameters are off-line linear least squares estimated (IDIM-LS) where the IDIM is calculated with the joint position and its noisy derivatives, which cannot take into account variations of the parameters. The new method called IDIM-ILIC (IDIM with Iterative Learning Identification and Control) overcomes these 2 drawbacks. The parameters are periodically calculated over a moving time window to update the IDM of the CTC, and the IDIM is calculated with the noise-free data of the trajectory generator, which avoids using the noisy derivatives of the actual joint position. A study of convergence of the method is performed in simulation and an experimental setup with stationary parameters and with a variation of the payload on a prismatic joint validates the procedure.",

        "abstract": "The development of trustworthy human-assistive robots is a challenge that goes beyond the traditional boundaries of engineering. Essential components of trustworthiness are safety, predictability and usefulness. In this paper we demonstrate that the integration of joint action understanding from human-human interaction into the human-robot context can significantly improve the success rate of robot-to-human object handover tasks. We take a two layer approach. The first layer handles the physical aspects of the handover. The robot's decision to release the object is informed by a Hidden Markov Model that estimates the state of the handover. Inspired by human-human handover observations, we then introduce a higher-level cognitive layer that models behaviour characteristic for a human user in a handover situation. In particular, we focus on the inclusion of eye gaze / head orientation into the robot's decision making. Our results demonstrate that by integrating these non-verbal cues the success rate of robot-to-human handovers can be significantly improved, resulting in a more robust and therefore safer system.",

        "abstract": "A novel solution to the problem of controlling a one degree-of-freedom ball juggling system that explicitly models friction is proposed. A hybrid controller is designed to steer the ball to track a specific reference trajectory. The juggling system consists of a nearly-smooth vertical shaft with a piston-actuated bouncing ball. The hybrid controller is capable of tracking a periodic reference trajectory. A practical (finite-time) tracking property is established using hybrid systems theory, while juggling experiments are presented to validate the hybrid control algorithm. Key to these experimental results are: 1) the use of a filtered zero-crossing impact detection algorithm; 2) a Savitzky-Golay filter for smooth piston position and velocity; 3) a custom external PID controller; and 4) the estimation of the apparatus parameters via system ID methods.",

In particular, this approach (abbreviated, KVP) combines the power of symbolic, knowledge-level AI planning with the efficient computation of volumes, which serve as an intermediate representation for both robot action and perception.

The experimental results verify that our algorithm can robustly localize traffic signs in images under various weather conditions and driving scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) revolutionized surgery by drastically reducing patient recovery times by allowing surgeons to perform procedures through a series of small incisions. However, MIS has also increased the complexity of the tasks as tools did not have the same degrees of freedom and dexterity compared to open procedures. In particular, pediatric patients pose a unique challenge as they have smaller volumes and different tissue properties. Our group designed KidsArm, an image-guided pediatric surgical robot, to automate anastomosis. KidsArm is single port anastomosis tool that uses a pair of stereo cameras to generate a 3D point cloud to guide the tool tip and apply a series of sutures. The system was designed to be minimally invasive and constrained by standard pediatric trocar sizes while also being automated. An image processing system was created to extract and track surface features on the simulated tissue samples while providing feedback to the robot controller. The system was tested on two scenarios: side-to-side and end-to-end silicone samples. KidsArm successfully applied 3 sutures autonomously on the side-to-side scenario however the end-to-end scenario proved to be more difficult due to greater deformation and workspace restrictions. However, KidsArm demonstrates that it is feasible for a robot to autonomously perform anastomosis. More work will be required to accelerate the process and characterize the behavior with tissue samples.",

For detection of external forces we apply a momentum based disturbance observer known from manipulator control to the floating-base model of a humanoid robot. These external forces are used as a trigger for implementing a compliant behavior at the interaction point and are integrated into a predictive balancing algorithm. For representation of the motion data, a hidden Markov model is used, which allows for an iterative update of the discrete motion states as well as a smooth generation of continuous motion data. Finally, we present an application of these algorithms on the humanoid robot TORO.",

Kinodynamic motion planning is the planning technique of generating a control input by solving the problems of kinematic constraints and dynamic constraints simultaneously, and it is useful for simpler generation of the control input. In this paper, we extend existing kinodynamic motion planning, which uses \u201cHarmonic potential field (HPF)\u201d and some damping forces for the control of simple point mass, to the motion planning for an X4-Flyer, which is a complex multivariable system. Then, we use \u201cnonlinear anisotropic damping forces (NADFs),\u201d which is proposed by Masoud, as damping force. In the simulation, a method using NADFs is compared with that using viscous damping forces. From the simulation, it is confirmed that the kinodynamic motion planning can be realized for an X4-Flyer.",

        "abstract": "Iterative Learning Control algorithms are based on the premise that \u201cpractice makes perfect\u201d. By iteratively performing an action, repetitive errors can be learned and accounted for in subsequent iterations, in a non-causal and feedforward manner. This method has been previously implemented for a quadrocopter system, enabling the quadrocopter to learn to accurately track high-performance slalom trajectories. However, one major limitation of this system is that knowledge from previously learned trajectories is not generalized or transferred to new trajectories; these must be learned from a state of zero experience. This paper experimentally shows that the major dynamics of the Iterative Learning Control process can be captured by a linear map, trained on previously learned slalom trajectories. This map enables this prior knowledge to be used to improve the initialization of an unseen trajectory. Experimental results show that prediction based on a single prior is enough to reduce the initial tracking error for an unseen trajectory by an order of magnitude.",

Important information for discrimination are the depth which targets are buried, so estimation methods of this physical property are desired.

Our detection approach is built up of three stages: First, a hierarchical segmentation approach generates a hierarchy of coarse-to-fine segments to reduce the impact of over- and under-segmentation in later stages. Next, we employ a learned mixture model to classify all segments. The model combines multiple softmax regression classifiers learned on specific bag-of-word representations using different parameterizations of a descriptor. In the final stage, we filter irrelevant and duplicate detections using a greedy method in consideration of the segment hierarchy. We experimentally evaluate our approach on recently published real-world datasets to detect pedestrians, cars, and cyclists.",

In this paper we investigate the problem of making a robot learn how to approach a person in order to increase the chance of a successful engagement. We propose the use of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), combined with ideas from reinforcement learning to make sure the space is properly and continuously explored. In the proposed example scenario, this is used by the robot to predict the best decisions in relation to its position in the environment and approach distance, each one accordingly to a certain time of the day. Numerical simulations show a significant performance improvement when compared with a random technique. The robot is able to improve performance after just one day of interaction (a few dozens of trials), and achieves the maximum expected value for the proposed approach within sixty days.",

        "abstract": "Achieving coordination between a lower-limb exoskeleton and its user is challenging because walking is a dynamic process that involves multiple, precisely timed muscle activations. Electromyographical (EMG) feedback, in spite of its drawbacks, provides an avenue for assistance by enabling users to reduce the level of muscle activation required for walking. As an alternative to direct EMG feedback, we present a method for exoskeleton control based on learning the activation pattern of specific muscles during cyclic movements. Using the example of pendular leg motion, the torque profile of one muscle group (hip flexors) is learned in a two-step process. First, the estimated torque profile is indexed to the phase of the swing movement using an adaptive frequency oscillator (AFO). The profile is then encoded using linear weighted regression. In the algorithm's assistive mode, the learned profile is reconstructed by means of the AFO and without need for additional EMG input. The reconstructed profile is converted into a torque profile to be physically delivered by the exoskeleton. We tested our method on a single-actuator exoskeleton that assists the hip joint during stationary leg swing. The learning and assistance functions were built on top of an admittance controller that enhances the exoskeleton's mechanical transparency. Initial tests showed a high level of coordination, i.e. simultaneous positive work, between the subjects' hip flexor torque and the exoskeleton's assistive torque. This result opens the door for future studies to test the users' ability to reduce their muscle activation in proportion to the assistance delivered by the exoskeleton.",

Extending previous work on robot imitation learning, that has so far mostly concentrated on learning from demonstrations by a single actor, we simultaneously record the movements of two humans engaged in on-going interaction tasks and learn compact models of the interaction. Extracted interaction models can thereafter be used by a robot to engage in a similar interaction with a human partner. We present two algorithms for deriving interaction models from motion capture data as well as experimental results on a humanoid robot.",

        "abstract": "Deploying robots to our day-to-day life requires them to have the ability to learn from their environment in order to acquire new task knowledge and to flexibly adapt existing skills to various situations. For typical real-world tasks, it is not sufficient to endow robots with a set of primitive actions. Rather, they need to learn how to sequence these in order to achieve a desired effect on their environment. In this paper, we propose an intuitive learning method for a robot to acquire sequences of motions by combining learning from human demonstrations and reinforcement learning. In every situation, our approach treats both ways of learning as alternative control flows to optimally exploit their strengths without inheriting their shortcomings. Using a Gaussian Process approximation of the state-action sequence value function, our approach generalizes values observed from demonstrated and autonomously generated action sequences to unknown inputs. This approximation is based on a kernel we designed to account for different representations of tasks and action sequences as well as inputs of variable length. From the expected deviation of value estimates, we devise a greedy exploration policy following a Bayesian optimization criterion that quickly converges learning to promising action sequences while protecting the robot from sequences with unpredictable outcome. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to efficiently learn appropriate action sequences in various situations on a manipulation task involving stacked boxes.",

The interaction with surrounding objects in the environment must be considered in order to perform the task without causing the objects fall or get damaged. In this paper, we learn the semantics in terms of support relationship among different objects in a cluttered environment by utilizing various photometric and geometric properties of the scene. To manipulate an object of interest, we use the inferred support relationship to derive a sequence in which its surrounding objects should be removed while causing minimal damage to the environment. We believe, this work can push the boundary of robotic applications in grasping, object manipulation and picking-from-bin, towards objects of generic shape and size and scenarios with physical contact and overlap. We have created an RGBD dataset that consists of various objects used in day-to-day life present in clutter. We explore many different settings involving different kind of object-object interaction. We successfully learn support relationships and predict support order in these settings.",

In this paper we present an approach to learn a dynamic model of a door from sensor observations and utilize it for effectively swinging the door open to a desired angle. The learned model enables the realization of dynamic door-opening strategies and reduces the complexity of the door opening task. For example, the robot does not need to maintain a grasp of the handle, which would form a closed kinematic chain. Accordingly, it reduces the degrees of freedom required of the manipulator and facilitates motion planning. Additionally, execution is faster, because the robot merely needs to push the door long enough to achieve the right combination of position and speed such that the door stops at the desired state. Our approach applies Gaussian process regression to learn the deceleration of the door with respect to position and velocity of the door. This model of the dynamics can be easily learned from observing a human teacher or by interactive experimentation.",

        "abstract": "In many multi-robot problems, the performance of a team of robots is not the sum of their individual capabilities; there is often synergy among the robots. We recently introduced the synergy graph model to model such phenomena, where robots are represented by vertices in a graph, their capabilities represented by Normally-distributed variables, and the interactions of robots represented with the structure of the graph. The synergy graph is learned from observations of robot team performances, with the underlying assumption that observations of all the robots are available at once. However, it is common that new information becomes available over time, in particular as new robots enter the domain. In this paper, we contribute a learning algorithm that uses new information to add a new robot into an existing synergy graph, that requires a smaller number of observations and faster computation than relearning the entire synergy graph using the existing learning algorithms. We introduce three heuristics to initialize the learning algorithm, and perform extensive simulations to analyze their characteristics, as well as compare two methods of learning robot capabilities, over a variety of graph structure types. We also compare three approaches to learning synergy graphs, and demonstrate that adding a new teammate into an existing synergy graph introduces higher error than completely relearning the synergy graph. However, it is computationally less expensive to add a new teammate, especially when the number of robots is large.",

This knowledge is later used as a decision rule in the fusion task in order to dynamically select the most appropriate subset of sensors. For this purpose we use the Mixture of Experts framework. In our application, each expert is a Kalman filter fed by a subset of sensors, and a gating network serves as a mediator between individual filters, basing its decision on sensor inputs and contextual information to reason about the operation context.

        "abstract": "In this paper we present the projection and bias heuristic (PBH), a motion planning algorithm that makes use of low-dimensional projections to improve sampling-based planning algorithms. In contrast to other state-of-the-art methods, we do not assume that projections are either random or given by an expert user. Rather, our goal is to learn projections such that planning on them improves the efficiency and the quality of solutions. We present both, a method to learn effective projections and a sampling algorithm that makes use of them. We show that our approach can be easily integrated into popular sampling-based planners. Extensive experiments performed in simulated environments demonstrate that our approach produces paths that are in general shorter than those obtained with state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, it generally requires less computation time.",

        "abstract": "Learning can be used to optimize robot motions to new situations. Learning motions can cause high frequency random motions in the exploration phase and can cause failure before the motion is learned. The mean time between failures (MTBF) of a robot can be predicted while it is performing these motions. The predicted MTBF in the exploration phase can be increased by filtering actions or possible actions of the algorithm. We investigated five algorithms that apply this filtering in various ways and compared them to SARSA(\u03bb) learning. In general, increasing the MTBF decreases the learning performance. Three of the investigated algorithms are unable to increase the MTBF while keeping their learning performance approximately equal to SARSA(\u03bb). Two algorithms are able to do this: the PADA algorithm and the low-pass filter algorithm. In case of LEO, a bipedal walking robot that tries to optimize a walking motion, the MTBF can be increased by a factor of 108 compared to SARSA(\u03bb). This indicates that, in some cases, failures due to high frequency random motions can be prevented without decreasing the performance.",

The combination of agility, reactivity, and persistent presence makes autonomous robots ideal for targeted sampling of elusive, episodic events such as algal blooms. In order to achieve this goal, they need to be deployed at the right place and time. To that end, we have designed and will soon deploy a shore-based event recognition technology to continuously monitor remote sensing imagery for algal blooms as targets for robotic field experiments. A Support Vector Machine underlies a field-tested decision support system which scientists will consult prior to deploying robots in the coastal ocean. Our aim is to target oceanographic field experiments for evaluation and verification.",

Finding a balance between user comfort and efficiency is a complex problem given the considerable variation present. This paper focuses on comfort, as opposed to absolute temperature, as gauged using simple, sparse user inputs. A thermal model of the house is learned which accounts for weather data and exogenous factors such as occupancy. By incorporating user feedback, a Learning-Based Model Predictive Controller (LBMPC) is able adapt to home conditions and more efficiently operate the system. In contrast to previous efforts which operate in office spaces and to a set point, this work is adapted and tested in a typical home environment and closes a control loop on user comfort. The controller considers that the user's comfort levels may change during the day, for example when the user is in bed, or not at home. It shows that complex systems may be automated without extensive tweaking by the user and in a manner that considers user comfort, time of day, and related factors to reduce energy consumption.",

In order to meet the demand from such applications, an experience-based learning approach can be used. In this paper, a novel learning algorithm is proposed, which can learn an unknown system model from given data iteratively using a localization approach to manage the computational costs for real time applications. The algorithm segments the data domain by measuring significance of data. As case studies, the proposed algorithm is tested on the control of the mecanum-wheeled robot and in learning the inverse kinematics of a kinematically-redundant manipulator. As the result, the algorithm achieves the on-line system model learning for real time robotics applications.",

While strides have been made in negotiating terrains cluttered with obstacles, dealing with surface property variations has received less consideration. This work presents a leg stiffness control strategy that estimates the surface compliance and adjusts the leg stiffness in order to maintain a nominal locomotion behavior while allowing for stable transitions between surfaces of up to three orders of magnitude differences in ground compliance. Implementation of this technique with high-bandwidth variable stiffness actuators that are currently being developed will expand the range of legged robotic platforms to environments with sudden and significant changes in terrain characteristics.",

To this end, we present a novel laser-based scheme for teach-and-repeat of mobile robot trajectories that relies on scan matching to localize the robot relative to a taught trajectory, which is represented by a sequence of raw odometry and 2D laser data. This approach has two advantages. First, it does not require to build a globally consistent metrical map of the environment, which reduces setup time. Second, the direct use of raw sensor data avoids additional errors that might be introduced by the fact that grid maps only provide an approximation of the environment. Real-world experiments carried out with a holonomic and a differential drive platform demonstrate that our approach repeats trajectories with an accuracy of a few millimeters. A comparison with a standard Monte Carlo localization approach on grid maps furthermore reveals that our method yields lower tracking errors for teach-and-repeat tasks.",

Although mostly known from video processing, keyframe selection faces new challenges in the lifelog domain. To obtain a keyframe that is close to a user-selected frame, we propose a keyframe selection method based on image quality measurements and excitement features. Image quality measurements such as contrast, color variance, sharpness, noise and saliency are used to filter high quality images. However, high quality images are not necessarily keyframes because humans also use emotions in the selection process. In this study, we employ a biosensor to measure the excitement of humans. In previous investigation, keyframe selection using only image quality measurements yielded an acceptance rate of 79.70%. Our proposed method achieves an acceptance rate of 84.45%.",

        "abstract": "Many applications require autonomous agents to achieve quick responses to task instances drawn from a rich family of qualitatively-related tasks. We address the setting where the tasks share a state-action space and have the same qualitative objective but differ in dynamics. We adopt a transfer learning approach where common structure in previously-learnt policies, in the form of shared subtasks, is exploited to accelerate learning in subsequent ones. We use a probabilistic mixture model to describe regions in state space which are common to successful trajectories in different instances. Then, we extract policy fragments from previously-learnt policies that are specialised to these regions. These policy fragments are options, whose initiation and termination sets are automatically extracted from data by the mixture model. In novel task instances, these options are used in an SMDP learning process and option learning repeats over the resulting policy library. The utility of this method is demonstrated through experiments in a standard navigation environment and then in the RoboCup simulated soccer domain with opponent teams of different skill.",

        "abstract": "Hummingbirds are promising reference for small flying robots in terms of their excellent ability to hover. Wing kinematics and shape of a hovering hummingbird were measured with four high-speed video cameras. Four types of wing models consisting of carbon fiber rods and polymer membranes with the same planform as the hummingbird wing were fabricated. 1-degree-of-freedom (DOF) flapping experiments with the wing models were performed, where the wing deformation and vertical force (hereafter called `lift') were measured. The model wings demonstrated similar feathering deformation as that of the hummingbird in the upstroke. In addition, the model wing with a loosened membrane which caused larger feathering deformation produced lift enough to support the weight of the hummingbird. The results suggest that hovering hummingbirds could be modeled as a pair of 1-DOF flapping wings with a thin membrane which passively feathers.",

        "abstract": "Traditional vision-based localization methods such as visual SLAM suffer from practical problems in outdoor environments such as unstable feature detection and inability to perform location recognition under lighting, perspective, weather and appearance change. Additionally map construction on a large scale in these systems presents its own challenges. In this work, we present a novel method for precisely localizing vehicles on the road using signs marked on the road (road markings), which have the advantage of being distinct and easy to detect, their detection being robust under changes in lighting and weather. Our method uses corners detected on road markings to perform localization in global coordinates. The method consists of two phases \u2014 a mapping phase when a high-quality GPS device is used to automatically survey road marks and add them to a light-weight \u201cmap\u201d or database, and a localization phase where road mark detection and look-up in the map, combined with visual odometry, produces precise localization. We present experiments using a real-time implementation operating in a car that demonstrates the improved localization robustness and accuracy of our system even when using road marks alone. However, in this case the trajectory between road marks has to be filled-in by visual odometry, which contributes drift. Hence, we also present a mechanism for combining road-mark-based maps with sparse feature-based maps that results in greater accuracy still. We see our use of road marks as a significant step in the general trend of using higher-level features for improved localization performance irrespective of environment conditions.",

Based on the hydraulic servo actuator dynamics, the paper describes the details of velocity and force control of the robot joints, along to our passivity-based force control framework. Details on the hardware including the mechanisms, microcontrollers, and simulators are also described.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a strategy for large-scale SLAM through solving a sequence of linear least squares problems. The algorithm is based on submap joining where submaps are built using any existing SLAM technique. It is demonstrated that if submaps coordinate frames are judiciously selected, the least squares objective function for joining two submaps becomes a quadratic function of the state vector. Therefore, a linear solution to large-scale SLAM that requires joining a number of local submaps either sequentially or in a more efficient Divide and Conquer manner, can be obtained. The proposed Linear SLAM technique is applicable to both feature-based and pose graph SLAM, in two and three dimensions, and does not require any assumption on the character of the covariance matrices or an initial guess of the state vector. Although this algorithm is an approximation to the optimal full nonlinear least squares SLAM, simulations and experiments using publicly available datasets in 2D and 3D show that Linear SLAM produces results that are very close to the best solutions that can be obtained using full nonlinear optimization started from an accurate initial value. The C/C++ and MATLAB source codes for the proposed algorithm are available on OpenSLAM.",

Over the years, a number of different velocity obstacle variants have been developed to effectively handle multi-robot systems. In parallel, an alternative, human-inspired approach for robot navigation has been recently proposed, which derives from the observation and modeling of crowds of pedestrians. We discuss similarities and differences among two broadly used obstacle-velocity variants, namely Hybrid Reciprocal Velocity Obstacle and Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance, and the human-inspired approach. How do these differences (which are often subtle) impact performance, and why? We answer these questions through extensive simulation experiments, wherein we evaluate the the algorithms for safety, trajectory efficiency, and emergence of collective behaviors, in different challenging multi-robot scenarios using both ideal and realistic models for robots and sensing.",

Building on recent advances in Least Squares Temporal Difference Learning, the proposed approach is able to learn from data collected from interactions with a system, in order to build a global control policy based on localised models of the state-action value function. Evaluations are reported characterising learning performance for non-linear control problems including an under-powered pendulum swing-up task, and a robotic door-opening problem under different dynamical conditions.",

        "abstract": "Presented are results demonstrating that, in developing a system with its first objective being the sustained detection of adults and young children as they move and interact in a normal preschool setting, the direct application of the straightforward RGB-D innovations presented here significantly outperforms even far more algorithmically advanced methods relying solely on images. The use of multiple RGB-D sensors by this project for depth-aware object localization economically resolves numerous issues regularly frustrating earlier vision-only detection and human surveillance methods, issues such as occlusions, illumination changes, unexpected postures, atypical morphologies, erratic or unanticipated motions, reflections, and misleading textures and colorations. This multiple RGB-D installation forms the front-end for a multi-step pipeline, the first portion of which seeks to isolate, in situ, 3D renderings of classroom occupants sufficient for a later analysis of their behaviors and interactions. Towards this end, a voxel-based approach to foreground/background separation and an effective adaptation of supervoxel clustering for 3D were developed, and 3D and image-only methods were tested and compared. The project's setting is highly challenging, but then so are its longer term goals: the automated detection of early childhood precursors, ofttimes very subtle, to a number of increasingly common developmental disorders.",

First strategy is the selection of a gait relying on locomotion rewards. The locomotion reward has been proposed as an indicator for selection algorithm based on Falling Risk and the moving speed. This strategy has achieved a capability of large changes of uncertainties, such as a steep slope. Second strategy is adjustment of moving speed by the extended locomotion reward that explicitly shows the relationship between the moving speed and Falling Risk. The robot aims at the maximum moving speed without a falling, and removes small changes of uncertainties as a result. We performed an experiment in order to confirm effects of two strategies in an environment that includes a rough terrain as a small uncertainty and two steps as a large uncertainty. The robot improved the moving speed about 37.5% from the case of only using the gait selection strategy.",

Generally bending mechanisms with fluidic rubber actuators can have advantages of smooth and continuous motion, however because of their low stiffness it is difficult to generate high output force. To solve this problem, we have proposed a novel bending mechanism combined with contracting and extending rubber actuators. By bundling rubber actuators with different types, the developed bending mechanism can have the high stiffness. In this report, optimized extending and contracting rubber actuators are made basis on a McKibben actuator, then they are combined to be the bending mechanism. Experimentally stiffness of the mechanism is measured and is compared with a bending mechanism bundled with same motion type actuators. Resulting high stiffness can be recognized by the proposed mechanism. Additionally, a very long bending mechanism, which is 7m in length, is developed and its motion is demonstrated.",

To this end, we think that the practical long-term on-line concept/word learning algorithm for robots and the interactive learning framework are the key issues to be addressed. In this paper we develop a practical on-line learning algorithm that solves three remaining problems in our previous study. We also propose an interactive learning framework, in which the proposed on-line learning algorithm is embedded.

On the contrary, the wheels will skid in the longitudinal direction in order to generate resistance force to balance the gravity component when a rover moves down the slopes. The wheel-terrain interaction principles of slip versus skid are quite different, but there is little research about the longitudinal skid mechanics and the relationship of it with the slip mechanics. This paper analyzes the problem of longitudinal slip and skid that occur to a wheel on the slopes with the knowledge of terramechanics. The slip and skid mechanics are compared based on experimental results measured by a single wheel testbed. The piece wise linear function is proposed to predict the drawbar pull and resistance moment under both slip and skid conditions. A semi-empirical equation of predicting the skid mechanics according to the slip mechanics is also provided. The models are verified using the experimental data.",

        "abstract": "At the current state of the art, the agility of an autonomous flying robot is limited by its sensing pipeline, because the relatively high latency and low sampling frequency limit the aggressiveness of the control strategies that can be implemented. To obtain more agile robots, we need faster sensing pipelines. A Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) is a very different sensor than a normal CMOS camera: rather than providing discrete frames like a CMOS camera, the sensor output is a sequence of asynchronous timestamped events each describing a change in the perceived brightness at a single pixel. The latency of such sensors can be measured in the microseconds, thus offering the theoretical possibility of creating a sensing pipeline whose latency is negligible compared to the dynamics of the platform. However, to use these sensors we must rethink the way we interpret visual data. This paper presents a method for low-latency pose tracking using a DVS and Active Led Markers (ALMs), which are LEDs blinking at high frequency (>1 KHz). The sensor's time resolution allows distinguishing different frequencies, thus avoiding the need for data association. This approach is compared to traditional pose tracking based on a CMOS camera. The DVS performance is not affected by fast motion, unlike the CMOS camera, which suffers from motion blur.",

Using these results, a force and position control law is proposed by taking the advantages of the redundancy of input generalized forces to the constrained forces and instantaneous process without involving any force sensor, using dual nature of constraint motion stated in this document. Then proof confirming by Lyapunov method that the exerting force equals instantaneously and constantly to desired one and that the motion of robot's hand in a movable space converges to desired hand's position. The effectiveness has been confirmed by a 2-link robot in simulations.",

Each individual module can pivot to move linearly on a substrate of stationary modules. The modules can use the same operation to perform convex and concave transitions to change planes. Each module can also move independently to traverse planar unstructured environments. The modules achieve these movements by quickly transferring angular momentum accumulated in a self-contained flywheel to the body of the robot. The system provides a simplified realization of the modular actions required by the sliding cube model using pivoting. We describe the principles, the unit-module hardware, and extensive experiments with a system of eight modules.",

To avoid the caveats of current image-search algorithms in case of severe viewpoint changes between the query and the database images, we propose to generate virtual views of the scene, which exploit the air-ground geometry of the system. To limit the computational complexity of the algorithm, we rely on a histogram-voting scheme to select the best putative image correspondences. The proposed approach is tested on a 2 km image dataset captured with a small quadroctopter flying in the streets of Zurich. The success of our approach shows that our new air-ground matching algorithm can robustly handle extreme changes in viewpoint, illumination, perceptual aliasing, and over-season variations, thus, outperforming conventional visual place-recognition approaches.",

For benchmarking, incremental encoders with 2 million counts per revolution are also used to supply the joint motion state feedback. The two motion state estimation methods are compared using Cartesian path trajectory closed-loop control experiments with both position feedback-based proportional control and motion state-based feedback control. The experiments show that the proposed MEMS-based state feedback control yields comparable tracking results compared with the high accuracy encoder. Furthermore, the MEMS-based angular acceleration estimation in particular is free from typical differentiation induced noise amplification and post-filtering phase-lag.",

        "abstract": "The magnetic field in indoor environments is rich in features and exceptionally easy to sense. In conjunction with a suitable form of odometry, such as signals produced from inertial sensors or wheel encoders, a map of this field can be used to precisely localize a human or robot in an indoor environment. We show how the use of this field yields significant improvements in terms of localization accuracy for both legged and non-legged locomotion. We suggest various likelihood functions for sequential Monte Carlo localization and evaluate their performance based on magnetic maps of different resolutions. Specifically, we investigate the influence that measurement representation (e.g., intensity-based, vector-based) and map resolution have on localization accuracy, robustness, and complexity. Compared to other localization approaches (e.g., camera-based, LIDAR-based), there exist far fever privacy concerns when sensing the indoor environment's magnetic field. Furthermore, the required sensors are less costly, compact, and have a lower raw data rate and power consumption. The combination of technical and privacy-related advantages makes the use of the magnetic field a very viable solution to indoor navigation for both humans and robots.",

This paper also describes the evolution of magnetic omnidirectional wheels throughout the design and development of several solutions, resulting in lighter and smaller wheels which have less vibration and adapt better to smaller radius structures.

These magnetic microobjects can be controlled using magnetic-based manipulation systems. In this study, we analyze a minimum input motion control to minimize the currents at each of the electromagnets of a magnetic system. This minimum input control allows us to achieve point-to-point closed-loop motion control of microparticles in the three-dimensional space, at an average speed of 198 \u03bcm/s, and maximum root mean square position tracking error of 104 \u03bcm. The minimum input control system is further evaluated by comparing norm-2 of its resulting current vector to the current vector of a proportionalintegral (PI) control system. This comparison shows that the minimum input control achieves 11% decrease in the current input, as opposed to the PI control system. However, the PI control system achieves 43% and 285% higher average speed and positioning accuracy, respectively, as opposed to the minimum input controller. The magnetic-based minimum input control can be used to perform closed-loop control of magnetic microrobots while decreasing the current input.",

        "abstract": "We provide a comparative study between two self-propelled microrobots, i.e., magnetotactic bacteria and microjets. This study includes characterization of their fluidic properties (linear and rotational drag coefficients) based on their morphologies and characterization of their magnetic properties using the rotating-field technique. Further, the control characteristics of our microrobots are evaluated in the transient- and steady-states. The average boundary frequencies of our magnetotactic bacteria and microjets are 2.2 rad/s and 25.1 rad/s, respectively. The characterized fluidic properties and boundary frequencies are used in the characterization of the magnetic properties of our microrobots. The average magnetic dipole moments of our magnetotactic bacteria and microjets are 1.4\u00d710\u221217 A.m2 and 1.5\u00d710\u221213 A.m2 at magnetic field of 2 mT and linear velocities of 32 \u03bcm/s (approximately 6 body lengths per second) and 119 \u03bcm/s (approximately 2 body lengths per second), respectively. These characterized magnetic dipole moments are utilized in the realization of closed-loop control systems for the magnetotactic bacteria and microjets. Our closed-loop control system positions the magnetotactic bacteria and the microjets within the vicinity of reference positions with average diameters of 23 \u03bcm (approximately 4 body lengths) and 417 \u03bcm (approximately 8 body lengths), respectively.",

        "abstract": "We present a method to manipulate deformable objects that does not require modeling and simulating deformation. Our method is based on the concept of diminishing rigidity, which we use to quickly compute an approximation to the Jacobian of the deformable object. This Jacobian is used to drive the points within the deformable object towards a set of targets. However, this Jacobian alone is insufficient to avoid stretching the object beyond its allowed length and to avoid gripper collision with obstacles. Thus a key part of our approach is incorporating techniques to avoid collision and excessive stretching. Our experiments show how to perform several interesting tasks for one and two-dimensional deformable objects using our method. They also show how the method can be applied to collaborative tasks, where the robot and a user simultaneously manipulate the deformable object. Our experiments are conducted in simulation but we emphasize that our method does not have access to the model of the deformable object used by the simulator, although we assume we are able to sense the geometry of the object. While our method is local, we find that it is quite versatile in the range of tasks it can perform, especially since it has no knowledge of the model of the deformable object.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Recently, researchers showed growing interest in utilizing UHF Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for localizing tagged items with mobile robots in industrial scenarios. In this paper we present a novel three-dimensional (3D) probability sensor model of RFID antennas in the context of mapping passive RFID tags with mobile robots. The proposed 3D sensor model characterizes both detection rates and received signal strength (RSS). Compared to 2D-sensor model based approaches, the 3D model gains a higher mapping accuracy for 2D position estimation. Specially, with this sensor model, we are able to localize the tags in 3D by integrating the measurements from a pair of RFID antennas mounted at different heights of the robot. Furthermore, by integrating negative information (i.e., non-detections), the 3D mapping accuracy can be improved. Additionally, we utilize KLD-sampling to reduce the number of particles for our specific application, so that our algorithm can be performed online. Indoor experiments with a Scitos G5 robot demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We also provide the datasets of this work for download.",

        "abstract": "Estimating the pose in real-time is a primary function for intelligent vehicle navigation. Whilst different solutions exist, most of them rely on the use of high-end sensors. This paper proposes a solution that exploits an automotive type L1-GPS receiver, features extracted by low-cost perception sensors and vehicle proprioceptive information. A key idea is to use the lane detection function of a video camera to retrieve accurate lateral and orientation information with respect to road lane markings. To this end, lane markings are mobile-mapped by the vehicle itself during a first stage by using an accurate localizer. Then, the resulting map allows for the exploitation of camera-detected features for autonomous real-time localization. The results are then combined with GPS estimates and dead-reckoning sensors in order to provide localization information with high availability. As L1-GPS errors can be large and are time correlated, we study in the paper several GPS error models that are experimentally tested with shaping filters. The approach demonstrates that the use of low-cost sensors with adequate data-fusion algorithms should lead to computer-controlled guidance functions in complex road networks.",

Two position trackers are used to capture position and orientation of human end-effector (wrist) and human elbow in 3D space and a dataglove to capture human hand kinematics. Then the inverse kinematics (IK) of the Mitsubishi PA-10 7-DoF robot arm are solved in an analytical manner, in order for the human's and the robot artifact's end-effectors to achieve same position and orientation in 3D space (functional constraint). Redundancy is handled in the solution space of the robot arm's IK, selecting the most anthropomorphic solution computed, with a criterion of \u201cFunctional Anthropomorphism\u201d. Human hand motion is transformed to robot hand motion using the joint-to-joint mapping methodology. Finally in order for the user to be able to detect contact and \u201cperceive\u201d the forces exerted by the robot hand, a low-cost force feedback device, that provides a mixture of sensory information (visual and vibrotactile), was developed.",

In this paper, we developed a new method for constructing the boundary of the C-space obstacles (C-obst) of polygons. This method is simpler to implement and is theoretically more efficient than the existing techniques. Our main idea is to devote the computation on the discontinuity in temporal and spatial coherence where the structure of the C-obst changes. We also developed a method for estimating the generalized penetration depth by computing the distance between the query point and the C-obst surface.",

Direct human control of large populations seems even more challenging. In this paper we investigate control of mobile robots that move in a 2D workspace using three different system models. We focus on a model that uses broadcast control inputs specified in the global reference frame. In an obstacle-free workspace this system model is uncontrollable because it has only two controllable degrees of freedom \u2014 all robots receive the same inputs and move uniformly. We prove that adding a single obstacle can make the system controllable, for any number of robots. We provide a position control algorithm, and demonstrate through extensive testing with human subjects that many manipulation tasks can be reliably completed, even by novice users, under this system model, with performance benefits compared to the alternate models. We compare the sensing, computation, communication, time, and bandwidth costs for all three system models. Results are validated with extensive simulations and hardware experiments using over 100 robots.",

        "abstract": "Stras is a flexible robotic system based on the Anubis\u00ae platform from Karl Storz and is aimed for intralu-minal and transluminal procedures. It is composed of three cable-driven sub-systems, one endoscope and two insertable instruments. The bending instruments have three degrees of freedom and can be teleoperated by the user via two commercial master interfaces (Omega.7, Force Dimension). In this paper we investigate several ways to map the motions from the master side to the instruments, from joint per joint control to cartesian control. We describe these mappings and compare them in elementary tasks in an attempt to analyze how non-linearities affect the accuracy of control. Results show that joint control and pseudo-cartesian control provide equivalent accuracy but with different difficulties for the user.",

        "abstract": "We present a vision based method for the autonomous geolocation of ground vehicles and unmanned mobile robots in forested environments. The method provides an estimate of the global horizontal position of a vehicle strictly based on finding a geometric match between a map of observed tree stems, scanned in 3D by sensors onboard the vehicle, to another stem map generated from the structure of tree crowns observed in overhead imagery of the forest canopy. This method can be used in real-time as a complement to the Global Positioning System (GPS) in areas where signal coverage is inadequate due to attenuation by the forest canopy, or due to intentional denied access. The method presented in this paper has two key properties that are significant: i) It does not require a priori knowledge of the area surrounding the robot. ii) It uses the geometry of detected tree stems as the only input to determine horizontal geoposition.",

In particular, it is important to avoid falling by appropriately switching behaviors even if there are unknown disturbances. The authors proposed the maximal output admissible (MOA) set for the center of gravity (COG) regulator in the upright position. Based on the MOA set, we can switch feedback gains with the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) constraint satisfied. In this paper, the author extends MOA set framework to trajectory tracking controller. This extension makes it possible to switch controllers: regulator in the upright position and tracking controller of a stepping motion in order to avoid falling. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with a simulation.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we present a new fixture (self-attachable fixture) and tensile test system for measuring mechanical properties of cell sheet. To evaluate strength of cell sheet, it is the most important to measure mechanical properties of tensile mode. However, there has been no study which measured the tensile mechanical properties of cell sheet, since it has been difficult to attach a cell sheet in the tensile test system owing to the structure of the conventional fixture, and there has been no tensile test system which had a measurement range that covered the tension force range of the cell sheets. Therefore, we have addressed these problems by developing a self-attachable fixture and a tensile test system. By using developed system, we measured mechanical properties (tension, stress and initial stiffness) C2C12 of cell sheet cultured in different recipe of culture medium. The initial stiffness of cell sheet cultured in culture medium without FBS had a tendency to become stiffer. This indicates that our new fixture and test system are applicable for evaluating mechanical properties of cell sheets.",

The focus of this present research is a mechanics-based kinematic model of the proposed continuum manipulator using the Timoshenko beam theory to map the driven load to the manipulator shape. In the proposed model, the continuum manipulator is divided into several V-shape units, each of which consists of two 2-node Timoshenko beam elements. Compared with previous approaches, our proposed model discards the constant curvature approximation, in which the distributed force caused by the interface contact between the wire and the V-shape unit is also considered simultaneously. The proposed mechanics model is validated experimentally on a segment of Nitinol flexible manipulator, which illustrates the effectiveness of our model to describe the continuum manipulator shaping.",

It is based on three main mechanisms: a training method that accurately adapts RSSI-range models to the particular environment; a sensor activation/deactivation method that balances the different information contribution and energy consumptions of camera and RSSI measurements; and a distributed Information Filter to integrate the available measurements. The joint use of these mechanisms drastically reduces energy consumption -40% with no significant degradation w.r.t. existing schemes based on only cameras and shows better robustness to target occlusions. The scheme has been implemented and validated in the indoor CONET Integrated Testbed.",

Map merging is performed by combining image retrieval using bag-of-words, geometric verification, and pose adjustment. A key issue is robust data association. To cope with false matches, we perform group matching with pose propagation, which checks the geometric consistency of point correspondences over multiple frames. Also, we perform path consistency check, which examines the accumulated errors along a loop to eliminate inconsistent part map connections. Experiments show our method successfully built detailed 3D maps of indoor environments.",

This method can be used for 3 dimensional cell assembly by embedding cells in the thermoresponsive gel structures. Gel sheets can be fabricated by micrheaters on a substrate and maintained in the gel condition by the hysteresis character. The microstructures can be formed by assembling the gel sheets using a probe device. The generation of a thermoresponsive gel was conducted using the microheaters made of ITO on a substrate and the generated gel sheets were manipulated by a micromanipulator. The fabrication of a gel sheets was achieved using the hysteresis character and the fabricated gel sheets were picked and placed by the probe. The positioning of the gel blocks can be precisely controlled by the micromanipulator. The results indicate the method we propose has a great possibility to achieve 3D cell assembly without large stress to cells during the assembly and cell culture.",

        "abstract": "Previous works on the Gough-Stewart (GS) platform have shown that its visual servoing using the observation of its leg directions was possible by observing only three of its six legs but that the convergence to the desired pose was not guarantied. This can be explained by considering that the visual servoing of the leg direction of the GS platform was equivalent to controlling another robot, the 3-UPS that has assembly modes and singular configurations different from those of the GS platform. Considering this hidden robot model allowed the simplification of the singularity analysis of the mapping between the leg direction space and the Cartesian space. In this paper, the work on the definition of the hidden robot models involved in the visual servoing using the observation of the robot leg directions is extended to another robot, the Adept Quattro. It will be shown that the hidden robot model is completely different from the model involved in the control of the GS platform. Therefore, the results obtained for the GS platform are not valuable for this robot. The hidden robot has assembly modes and singular configurations different from those of the Quattro. An accuracy analysis is performed to show the importance of the leg selection. All these results are validated on a Quattro simulator created using ADAMS/Controls and interfaced with Matlab/Simulink.",

        "abstract": "Humans attribute meaning to actions, and can recognize, imitate, predict, compose from parts, and analyse complex actions performed by other humans. We have built a model of action representation and understanding which takes as input perceptual data of humans performing manipulatory actions and finds a semantic interpretation of it. It achieves this by representing actions as minimal plans based on a few primitives. The motivation for our approach is to have a description, that abstracts away the variations in the way humans perform actions. The model can be used to represent complex activities on the basis of simple actions. The primitives of these minimal plans are embodied in the physicality of the system doing the analysis. The model understands an action under observation by recognising which plan is occurring. Using primitives thus rooted in its own physical structure, the model has a semanticist and causal understanding of what it observes. Using plans, the model considers actions as well as complex activities in terms of causality, compositions, and goal achievement, enabling it to perform complex tasks like prediction of primitives, separation of interleaved actions and filtering of perceptual input. We use our model over an action dataset involving humans using hand tools on objects in a constrained universe to understand an activity it has not seen before in terms of actions whose plans it knows of. The model thus illustrates a novel approach of understanding human actions by a robot.",

In order from the simple to the most complex, it builds structures corresponding to myofibrils, muscle fibers, muscle fiber bundles and the skeletal muscle. This distinctive hierarchical structure of skeletal muscles has been intensively studied in interdisciplinary research fields. In engineering, how the system efficiently controls a large number of sarcomeres to express continuous output force, is a point that has been focused. In this research, we propose a new decentralized control which is very simple but can manage many binary functional units by exploiting environmental noise. The validity of method is confirmed in both numerical simulation and a developed biologically inspired actuator.",

To achieve these goals in an efficient manner, we combine EMF recognition method and gradient descent of SS measurements into a proactive robot motion control algorithm in a way that maintains connectivity among mobile robots in the presence of a radio frequency (RF) obstacle. The EMF recognition method utilizes hidden Markov models (HMMs) for learning EMF environments based on SS measurements. The proposed motion control algorithm uses the EMF recognition and gradient method results to drive the robots towards favorable locations in which robots can communicate. The numerical simulation demonstrates promising EMF recognition, robot motion control results and confirms their abilities in proactive robot motion control for connectivity maintenance.",

For a highly-accurate active space telescope, an important source of inaccuracy was measured using photogrammetry: the deformation of its mobile platform. This deformation cannot be directly measured in space and needs to be properly modeled in order to enable the telescope calibration with the available measurements. Two incremental models are proposed and the parameter observability is discussed. After experimental calibration, a micrometer accuracy can be reached. The influence of model discrepancy on the experimental parameter identification is finally discussed.",

We focus on describing its movements, posing a specific attention on cyclotorsion, that is the rotation around the eye optical axis. This study aims at understanding the cause of a cyclotorsion effect that has been noticed on a real setup. The paper starts from a qualitative analysis of the effect. Then, it proposes two different models for its motion. Finally both models are validated by comparing their predictions with the outcomes on the real robot. Given the complexity of the system and of its motion results are for the moment just qualitative and quantitative comparison will be the goal of our future works.",

        "abstract": "Robotic systems (RSs) are often used for performing critical tasks with little or no human intervention. Such RSs must satisfy certain dependability requirements including reliability, availability, security and safety. In this paper, we focus on the safety aspect and propose a methodology and associated framework for safety assessment of RSs in the early phases of development. The methodology relies upon model-driven engineering approach and describes a preliminary safety assessment of safety-critical RSs using fault tree (FT) analysis (FTA). The framework supports a domain specific language for RSs called RobotML and includes facilities (i) to automatically generate or manually construct FTs and perform both qualitative and quantitative FTA, (ii) to make semantic connections with formal verification and FTA tools, (iii) to represent FTA results in the RobotML modeling environment. In the case study, we illustrate the proposed methodology and framework by considering a mobile robot developed in the scope of the Proteus project.",

Under the proposed system, elastic cilia are attached to the surface of the robot; this arrangement should enable the robot to have better mobility in a microgravity environment. However, in the development of the ciliary micro-hopping mechanism theoretical modeling and analysis of the interactive mechanics between the cilia and the environment pose technical challenges that need to be addressed. In this paper, we present the dynamics modeling of the ciliary micro-hopping locomotion actuated by an eccentric motor, along with its experimental validations and numerical simulations. The results of this study contribute to the design optimization of both the cilia mechanism and the motor control scheme.",

        "abstract": "A model is presented for the analysis of the electric field and electrostatic adhesion force produced by interdigital electrodes. Assuming that the potential varies linearly with distance in inter-electrode gaps, the potential distribution on the electrode plane is obtained by taking the first-order Taylor series approximation. The expressions of electric field components are then derived by solving the Laplace equation for the electrical potential in each subregion. The electrostatic adhesion force is calculated using the Maxwell stress tensor formulation. The dynamic properties of the electric field and electrostatic adhesion force are assessed by evaluating the transient response of the field and force under a step in applied voltages. To verify the model developed, an experimental study is carried out in conjunction with the theoretical analysis to evaluate the adhesion performance of an electrode panel on a glass pane. A double tracked wall climbing robot is designed and tested on various wall surfaces. The limit of the approximation method of the inter-electrode potential is discussed. It is found that vacuum suction force is involved in the adhesion. The influence of this vacuum suction force on electrostatic adhesion is also discussed. The results of this work would provide support for theoretical guidelines and system optimization for the electrostatic adhesion technology applied to wall climbing robots.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We introduce our Pneumatic-Electric (PE) hybrid actuator model and propose to use the model to derive a controller for the hybrid actuation system by an optimal control method. Our PE hybrid actuator is composed of Pneumatic Artificial Muscle (PAM) and an electric motor. The PE hybrid actuator is light and can generate large torque. These properties are desirable for assistive devices such as exoskeleton robots. However, to maximally take advantage of PE hybrid system, we need to reasonably distribute necessary torque to these redundant actuators by properly taking distinctive characteristics of a pneumatic actuator and an electric motor into account. To do this, in this study, we use an optimal control method called iterative LQG to reasonably distribute the necessary torque to the PAM and the electric motor. The crucial issue to apply the optimal control method to the PE hybrid system is PAM modeling. We built a PAM model composed of three elements: 1) an (air)pressure-force conversion model, 2) a contraction rate model, 3) time delay of the air valve, and 4) the upper limit of force generation that depends on the contraction rate and the movable range. We apply our proposed method to a one degree of freedom (one-DoF) arm with PE hybrid actuator. The one-DoF arm successfully swing tasks 0.5 Hz, 2 Hz and 4 Hz and swing up and stability task by reasonably distributing necessary torque to the two different actuators in a simulated and a real environments.",

        "abstract": "This study proposes a model that combines a realistically scaled neural network made up of pools of spiking neurons, with a musculoskeletal model of the human arm. We used evidence from literature to design topological pools of spinal neurons and their synaptic connections. The spiking output of the motor neuron pools were used as the command signals that generated motor unit forces, and drove joint motion. Feedback information from muscle spindles was relayed to the neural network via monosynaptic and disynaptic pathways. Participant-specific parameters of the combined neuromuscu-loskeletal (NMS) system were then identified from recorded experimental data. The identified NMS model was used to simulate the arm stretch reflex and the results were validated by comparison to an independent recorded dataset. The models and methodology proposed in this study show that large and complex neural systems can be identified in conjunction with the musculoskeletal systems that they control. This additional layer of detail in NMS models has important relevance to the research communities related to rehabilitation robotics and human movement analysis.",

Stumbling correction and leg extension reflexes are implemented as feedbacks for fast corrections, and model-based posture control mechanisms define feedbacks for continuous corrections. The control strategy is validated on a detailed physics-based simulated model of a compliant quadruped robot, the Oncilla robot.

        "abstract": "We describe a distributed and autonomous technique for dynamic gait adaptation for a chain-type, modular self-reconfigurable robot (MSR) using a fuzzy logic based, closed-loop controller. To maneuver itself, each module of the MSR is provided with a set of basic or fundamental gaits within a gait control table(GCT). A relevant problem in locomotion of a chain-type MSR is how to coordinate the gait of the individual modules with each other so that the desired locomotion of the MSR can be achieved. To address this problem, our proposed controller maps the inputs from the sensors of each module to an appropriate gait for the module determined from the goal and position of the module in the configuration, using a fuzzy technique. An inertial measurement unit (IMU) is used to close the loop between the goal and the module. We have verified the operation of our controller on a simulated 3-D model of an MSR called ModRED within the Webots robot simulator and also implemented it on the physical ModRED MSR. Our results illustrate that our controller can successfully adapt ModRED's locomotion by dynamically combining basic gaits from the individual modules in the configuration, regardless of the number of modules in the configuration and in the presence of noisy sensor inputs.",

We propose and evaluate a novel modulation approach that includes force feedback and thus allows physical interaction with objects and the environment. The proposed approach also enables the coupling of independently executed robotic trajectories, simplifying the execution of bimanual and tightly coupled cooperative tasks. We apply an iterative learning control algorithm to learn a coupling term, which is applied to the original trajectory in a feed-forward fashion. The coupling term modifies the trajectory in accordance to either the desired position or external force. The strengths of the approach are shown in bimanual or two-agent obstacle avoidance tasks, where no higher level cognitive reasoning or planning are required. Results of simulated and real-world experiments on the ARMAR-III humanoid robot in interaction and object lifting tasks, and on two KUKA LWR robots in a bimanual setting are presented.",

The latter is composed of three actuated subsystems. The purpose of using fault diagnosis algorithms is to supervise the safe operating of the system, and to study the system reconfigurability strategies in order to ensure that the system remains able to follow a desired trajectory. For such purpose, the fault detectability and isolability is based on analytical redundancy relations. The latter are constraint relations expressing the nominal system behavior and they are written in terms of the measured system variables. Once a fault is detected and the faulty actuated subsystem is determined, the system reconfigurability algorithm analyses the redundancy presented on the former and an appropriate control strategy is applied.",

The specifications implicitly require both sequential regions to visit and the desired actions to perform at these regions. The robot's motion is abstracted based on sphere regions of interest in the workspace and the structure of navigation function(NF)-based controllers, while the robot's action map is constructed based on precondition and effect functions associated with the actions. An optimal planner is designed that generates the discrete motion-and-action plan fulfilling the specification, as well as the low-level hybrid controllers that implement this plan. The whole framework is demonstrated by a case study.",

A human periodic motion is measured by a motion capture system, and it is projected onto a low dimensional space based on principal component analysis. The low dimensional motion pattern is modified, so that the high dimensional motion pattern satisfies the motion conditions, dynamical consistency and joint angle and torque limitations. The proposed method is applied to the motion pattern design of the planar bipedal robot. The moon-walk performed by a human is transformed to the robot motion. In this case, the motion conditions are the kinematic closed loop condition and the ground contact states of foot links. The floor reaction force condition and the satisfaction of the motion equation are given for dynamical consistency.",

We abstract the mobility structure of these systems using a tethered differential drive robot with rimless wheels. We analyze several important issues related to this geometry. First it is shown that this vehicle cannot be modeled deterministically unless an additional degree of freedom relative to the standard differential drive vehicle is provided. The simplest kinematically consistent model is one that allows for slight prismatic motion of the axle, approximating the effects of wheel slip. We show that under mild assumptions, such a vehicle's reachable set is dense in SE(2), implying local maneuverability. Next we study some of the constraints which the tether places on the vehicle's motions and derive scaling laws relating wheel and vehicle speeds. Using these results, we provide simple planning and approximate path-following methods that allow tether management. In particular, we consider trajectories produced by solving an optimal control problem to minimize the integral of absolute tether-reeling rate.",

However in the case of a robot-mounted camera, they encounter difficulties when the camera traverses large displacements. This scenario necessitates continuous visual target feedback during the robot motion, while simultaneously considering the robot's self- and external-constraints. Herein, we propose to combine workspace (Cartesian space) path-planning with robot teach-by-demonstration to address the visibility constraint, joint limits and \u201cwhole arm\u201d collision avoidance for vision-based control of a robot manipulator. User demonstration data generates safe regions for robot motion with respect to joint limits and potential \u201cwhole arm\u201d collisions. Our algorithm uses these safe regions to generate new feasible trajectories under a visibility constraint that achieves the desired view of the target (e.g., a pre-grasping location) in new, undemonstrated locations. Experiments with a 7-DOF articulated arm validate the proposed method.",

A key contribution is the design of two families of motion primitives for aerial robots flying in dense obstacle fields, along with rules to stitch them together. The primitives are obtained by solving for the flight dynamics of the aerial robot, and explicitly account for limited agility using time delays. The first family of primitives consists of turning maneuvers to link any two points in space. The locations of the terminal points are used to obtain closed-form expressions for the control inputs required to fly between them, while accounting for the finite time required to switch between consecutive sets of control inputs. The second family consists of aggressive turn-around maneuvers wherein the time delay between the angle of attack and roll angle commands is used to optimize the maneuver for the spatial constraints. A 3-D motion planning algorithm based on these primitives is presented for aircraft flying through a dense forest.",

This paper presents a method to create a modular setup for generating a large 3D point cloud, with attention to the study of interference, the influence of a USB extension cable, and the calibration procedure. The study of interference includes the influence of the distance between the cameras, the orientation of the cameras, and the illumination. Furthermore, this paper proposes a number of evaluation metrics for similar setups.",

        "abstract": "The next step in minimally invasive surgery is the further reduction of incisions by surgery through natural orifices (NOTES) or one single artificial incision (Single-Port). However, physicians pointed out, that those procedures are only possible if new technologies will increase the dexterity of the instruments inside of the body. Especially the missing ability to manipulate tissue from two sides (triangulation), needs to be obtained. This article is about the development of different kinematics for a Multi Arm Snake-Like Robot to manipulate flexible endoscopic instruments at the tip of a flexible endoscope. By using Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) it is feasible to create various shapes and designs, custom made for different patients. We are using flexure hinges and compliant mechanisms to create defined movements in serial kinematic structures. In the experiments, the relation between different structures and the influence of the inserted flexible endoscopic instrument are compared. The proposed kinematics are able to manipulate flexible endoscopic instruments. That proves that SLS structures get more advances towards a use for a flexible Single-Port Multi Arm Snake-Like Robot.",

The proposed sensor can also estimate the multimodal tactile information such as the slippage, the shape, the contact region and the location of the contacted object. Multi-axis contact force is transformed from the elastic membrane tensional force on the touchpad surface, and the touchpad inner pressure measured by the pressure transducer. We obtain the tensional force by solving the equilibrium equations developed in each compartmentalized segment of the membrane, based on the shape information of the touchpad. The proposed method is general and can be applied to various touchpad contact situations. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experimental results.",

The experiments elucidate that the developed gripper achieves envelop grasping; the posture of the gripper automatically fits the shape of the object with no sensory feedback. And they also show that the VSM effectively works to relieve external interfering. This paper shows the detail of the mechanism and the experiments of its motion.",

That kinematic redundancy can be utilized to execute additional tasks simultaneously, e. g. via null space projection techniques. We introduce a new representation of hierarchical robot dynamics which are based on a set of particular null space velocities. Dynamic consistency is preserved, and strict compliance with the order of priority is ensured at all times due to a power-conserving cancellation of coupling terms by active control. No external force measurements have to be performed. We show asymptotic stability of the generic closed-loop system with an arbitrary number of hierarchy levels. Several simulations confirm our results.",

This results in a substantial reduction of both the data to be transmitted and processed, that renders the system more robust and efficient. As documented by our simulated and real world experiments, these advantages come with a very little decrease in accuracy compared to ideal (but not realistic) methods that share the full data among all the robots.",

After formally defining this problem, we propose a novel solution that requires minimal communication and scales with the number of waypoints and robots. Our approach restricts explicit communication and coordination to occur only when robots reach waypoints, and relies on implicit coordination when moving between a given pair of waypoints. At the heart of our algorithm is the use of leader election to efficiently exploit the unique environmental knowledge available to each robot in order to plan paths for the group, which makes it general enough to work with robots that have heterogeneous representations of the environment. We implement our approach both in simulation and on a physical platform, and characterize the performance of the approach under various scenarios. We demonstrate that our approach can successfully be used to combine the planning capabilities of different agents.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new ant algorithm for the navigation of several robots, whose objective is to autonomously explore an unknown environment. When the coverage is completed, all robots move to a previously defined meeting point. The approach that we propose in this paper for solving this problem, considers that the robots build, while moving, a common and shared representation of the environment. In this representation, the environment is viewed as a graph (typically a set of connected cells in a regular grid), each grid cell having a local memory able to store a limited amount of data. A robot can write numbers on the cell on which it is lying. It can also read the values of the cells in its neighborhood, and perform some simple operations, such as computing the minimum of a set of values. Each robot is capable, contrary to most ant-based approaches, to determine, in a distributed way, when the environment coverage has completed. Few ant algorithms can do that. Brick&Mortar is one of them and this is why it retains a central place in our proposition. The novelty of our approach is that, due to an emerging property of the underlying algorithm, agents will finish their exploration at a predefined evacuation point. In addition, several improvements of the original Brick&Mortar algorithm are proposed in this paper, such as the possibility to use better local strategies at the robot level (using, for example, LRTA*). The paper also presents a set of benchmarks against the best existing ant algorithms on several widespread graph topologies.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Current robotic systems carry many diverse sensors such as laser scanners, cameras and inertial measurement units just to name a few. Typically such data is fused by engineering a feature that weights the different sensors against each other in perception tasks. However, in a long-term autonomy setting the sensor readings may change drastically over time which makes a manual feature design impractical. A method that can automatically combine features of different data sources would be highly desirable for adaptation to different environments. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering method, coined Layered Affinity Propagation, for automatic clustering of observations that only requires the definition of features on individual data sources. How to combine these features to obtain a good clustering solution is left to the algorithm, removing the need to create and tune a complicated feature encompassing all sources. We evaluate the proposed method on data containing two very common sensor modalities, images and range information. In a first experiment we show the capability of the method to perform scene segmentation on Kinect data. A second experiment shows how this novel method handles the task of clustering segmented colour and depth data obtained from a Velodyne and camera in an urban environment.",

First, a two-step occlusion reasoning algorithm is proposed to determine the occlusion region. Then, the spatial constraint-based appearance model with other interacting targets\u00b6 interferences is modeled. Finally, an n-person, non-zero-sum, non-cooperative game is constructed to handle the mutual occlusion problem. The individual measurements within the occlusion region are regarded as the players in the constructed game competing for the maximum utilities by using the certain strategies. The Nash Equilibrium of the game is the optimal estimation of the locations of the players within the occlusion region. Experiments conducted on publicly available videos demonstrate the good performance of the proposed occlusion handling algorithm.",

Unfortunately none of the existing approaches is able to interweave multiple manipulation tasks and execute them reliably at the same time, enabeling e.g. an intuitive human-robot cooperation. To bridge this gap, we suggest a novel reactive behavior-based architecture. For this, we transfer the multitasking concept from modern computer operating systems to the robot and use a resource based approach to coordination and synchronization. With this, we are able to safely run multiple competing behaviors on a robot. Due to the design of the behaviors, new behaviors can easily be added to the system. The behaviors can be interrupted by other behaviors in order to react properly to a dynamic environment. Later, the interrupted behaviors are resumed in such a way that the system keeps a consistent state.",

We examine the benefits of dense feature extraction and multimodal features for improving the accuracy and robustness of an instance recognition system. By combining multiple modalities and blending their scores through an ensemble-based method in order to generate our final object hypotheses, we obtain significant improvements over previously published results on two RGB-D datasets. On the Challenge dataset, our method results in only one missed detection (achieving 100% precision and 99.77% recall). On the Willow dataset, we also make significant gains on the prior state of the art (achieving 98.28% precision and 87.78% recall), resulting in an increase in F-score from 0.8092 to 0.9273.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we propose a method for concept formation and word acquisition for robots. The proposed method is based on multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation (MLDA) and the nested Pitman-Yor language model (NPYLM). A robot obtains haptic, visual, and auditory information by grasping, observing, and shaking an object. At the same time, a user teaches object features to the robot through speech, which is recognized using only acoustic models and transformed into phoneme sequences. As the robot is supposed to have no language model in advance, the recognized phoneme sequences include many phoneme recognition errors. Moreover, the recognized phoneme sequences with errors are segmented into words in an unsupervised manner; however, not all words are necessarily segmented correctly. The words including these errors have a negative effect on the learning of word meanings. To overcome this problem, we propose a method to improve unsupervised word segmentation and to reduce phoneme recognition errors by using multimodal object concepts. In the proposed method, object concepts are used to enhance the accuracy of word segmentation, reduce phoneme recognition errors, and correct words so as to improve the categorization accuracy. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of word segmentation and reduce the phoneme recognition error and that the obtained words enhance the categorization accuracy.",

The estimator was performed within a Bayesian network approach. To switch these two modes, a speech interface was used. The user's intention was modeled as a set of typical destinations visited by the user. The algorithm was implemented to one experimental wheelchair robot. The new application of the wheelchair system with more natural and easy-to-use human machine interfaces was one of the main contributions. as user's habits and points of interest are employed to infer the user's desired destination in a map. Erroneous steering signals coming from the user-machine interface input are filtered out, improving the overall performance of the system. Human aware navigation, path planning and obstacle avoidance are performed by the robotic wheelchair while the user is just concerned with \u201clooking where he wants to go\u201d.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel computational approach for modeling and generating multiple object manipulation behaviors by a humanoid robot. The contribution of this paper is that deep learning methods are applied not only for multimodal sensor fusion but also for sensory-motor coordination. More specifically, a time-delay deep neural network is applied for modeling multiple behavior patterns represented with multi-dimensional visuomotor temporal sequences. By using the efficient training performance of Hessian-free optimization, the proposed mechanism successfully models six different object manipulation behaviors in a single network. The generalization capability of the learning mechanism enables the acquired model to perform the functions of cross-modal memory retrieval and temporal sequence prediction. The experimental results show that the motion patterns for object manipulation behaviors are successfully generated from the corresponding image sequence, and vice versa. Moreover, the temporal sequence prediction enables the robot to interactively switch multiple behaviors in accordance with changes in the displayed objects.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposed a Multiple Microfluidic Stream based Manipulation (MMSM) for bio-objects using micro hydrodynamics and Lab on Chip (LOC) technology. Our method can manipulate bio-objects without contact under open space, the advantages of which were experimentally confirmed in this paper. Compared with other conventional bio-manipulation methods, this method is not directly in contact with the target bio-object, and was considered as a non-invasive and soft manipulation via hydrodynamic fluids. The basic principle of this system is manipulating a micro object by controlling several micro water streams which are generated from orifices under the operating area simultaneously. By changing the parameters of the water stream such as flow rates, position and number of operating orifices, the direction and velocity of the object can be controlled. To verify this principle, we designed an open space fluid model for on-chip manipulation, and simulated force and direction of the water stream using CFD software. Then the prototype microchip with an array of 8 orifices of diameter 100 \u03bcm, and 3 types of channels of widths 100 \u03bcm, 200 \u03bcm, and 500 \u03bcm respectively were fabricated with glass. In experiments several kinds of rectilinear motion of insect ovum and micro beads were observed. The results presented in this paper showed that this multi micro fluidic stream manipulation system has the capability for MMSM.",

HSTA is able to construct not only temporal associations between multiple objects, but also component-level spatiotemporal associations that allow the correction of falsely detected objects in the presence of various types of interaction among multiple objects. The proposed method was evaluated using the four representative interaction cases such as split, complete occlusion, partial occlusion, and multiple contacts. As a result, HSTA showed significantly more robust performance than did other temporal data association methods in the experiments.",

Assuming vehicles are equipped with proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors to localize the positions, a solution based on RFS statistics is therefore proposed to consider the whole group behavior instead of each vehicle. For this, we rely on Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filtering. Compared to other methods, our approach presents a recursive filtering algorithm that provides dynamic estimation of multiple vehicle states. The proposed method addresses the current challenges in multiple vehicle cooperative localization domain such as communication bandwidth issue, data association uncertainty and the over-convergence problem. A comparative study based on simulations demonstrates the reliability and the feasibility of the proposed approach in large scale environments.",

Each agent is given a starting and a goal position and its task is to reach the goal from the given start. When following the paths, agents must not collide with each other and must avoid obstacles. It is suggested to augment propositional encodings of CPF with a so called mutex reasoning. Mutex reasoning is trying to rule out unreachable situations to reduce the size of the search space. It is checked whether a given pair of locations is reachable by a given pair of agents cooperatively. If not occurrence of the pair of agents in the pair of vertices is forbidden. The performed experimental evaluation showed that mutex reasoning improves existent encodings by 2 to 5 times in terms of solving runtime when makespan optimal solutions are searched.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Concurrently estimating the 6-DOF pose of multiple cameras or robots - cooperative localization - is a core problem in contemporary robotics. Current works focus on a set of mutually observable world landmarks and often require inbuilt egomotion estimates; situations in which both assumptions are violated often arise, for example, robots with erroneous low quality odometry and IMU exploring an unknown environment. In contrast to these existing works in cooperative localization, we propose a cooperative localization method, which we call mutual localization, that uses reciprocal observations of camera-fiducials to obviate the need for egomotion estimates and mutually observable world landmarks. We formulate and solve an algebraic formulation for the pose of the two camera mutual localization setup under these assumptions. Our experiments demonstrate the capabilities of our proposal egomotion-free cooperative localization method: for example, the method achieves 2cm range and 0.7 degree accuracy at 2m sensing for 6-DOF pose. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed work, we deploy our method on Turtlebots and we compare our results with ARToolKit [1] and Bundler [2], over which our method achieves a tenfold improvement in translation estimation accuracy.",

A series of in situ techniques for the experimental investigations of memristors are developed including nanorobotic manipulation, electro-beam-based forming, and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) enabled correlation of transport properties and carrier distribution. All experimental investigations are performed inside a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The initial CuO NW memristors are formed by localized electron-beam irradiation to generate oxygen vacancies as dopants. Current-voltage properties show distinctive hysteresis characteristics of memristors. The mechanism of such memristic behaviors is explained with an oxygen vacancy migration model. The presence and migration of the oxygen vacancies is identified with EELS. Investigations also reveal that the memristic behavior can be influenced by the deformation of the nanowire, showing that the nanowire memristor can serve as a deformation/force memorable sensor. The CuO NW-based memristors will enrich the binary transition oxide family but hold a simpler and more compact design than the conventional thin-film version. With these advantages, the CuO NW-based memristors will not only facilitate their applications in nanoelectronics but play a unique role in micro-/nano-electromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS) as well.",

Based on local geometry properties, natural local approximation can achieve more accurate contouring error estimation compared with other local approximation methods for both planar and spatial contouring tasks. The contouring controller, integrated with a PD controller cooperated with the feedback linearization technique and a feedforward compensation, is designed to realize the decoupling control of estimated errors in the task frame. Contouring performance can then be improved directly by increasing corresponding controller parameters. Simulations of 3-axis system and experiments on biaxial XY-stage verified that our proposed method can reduce the contouring errors dramatically in high speed and large curvature cases compared with first-order based method.",

        "abstract": "Mobile robot navigation through natural terrains is a challenging issue with applications such as planetary exploration or search and rescue. This paper proposes navigability assessment of natural terrains scanned from ground-based 3D laser rangefinders. A continuous model of the terrain is obtained as a fuzzy elevation map (FEM). Based on this model, the proposed solution incorporates terrain navigability both in terms of uncertainties of the 3D input data and slope of the fuzzy surface. Moreover, the paper discusses the application of this method for local path planning. For this purpose, the Bug algorithm has been adapted to compute local paths on the navigable region of the FEM. The method has been applied to actual 3D point clouds on two different experimental sites.",

Each foraging act causes a deviation from the shortest path to the long-term goal, with consequences for path length, mission duration, and fuel usage. We analytically calculate and/or bound the expected distance the robot actually travels, given the initial distance to the the global goal. In particular, for either of two non-trivial greedy strategies: (A) forage the point that minimizes goal-heading deviation. (B) forage the closest point ahead of the robot. Our results generalize to problems in higher dimensions.",

        "abstract": "Using a multi-vehicle control scheme based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics, a simulated swarm of unmanned underwater vehicles is guided along a pre-computed optimal trajectory between two points in an open domain under the influence of a strong background flow. The pre-computed trajectory is optimal in terms of fuel usage for a single vehicle. If the gradient of the velocity field is small compared to the total swarm radius, guiding a swarm of vehicles along this trajectory gives nearly optimal trajectories for all vehicles in the swarm without requiring additional costly optimization computations. We provide a bound on the maximum energy cost for vehicles in the swarm and also provide a more realistic estimate of the maximum energy cost. We also determine that the energy cost scales as N3/2 for swarms with large numbers of vehicles, N. The algorithm and fuel cost bounds are verified in simulations of unmanned underwater vehicles moving across a double gyre system on the scale of a small ocean basin.",

Under some mild assumptions, we construct a finite approximation for the motion of the vehicle in the form of a tree-structured Markov Decision Process (MDP). We introduce an efficient algorithm, which exploits the tree structure of the MDP, for synthesizing a control policy that maximizes the probability of satisfaction. For the proposed PCTL fragment, we define the specification update rules that guarantee the increase (or decrease) of the satisfaction probability. We introduce an incremental algorithm for synthesizing an updated MDP control policy that reuses the initial solution. The initial specification can be updated, using the rules, until the supervisor is satisfied with both the updated specification and the corresponding satisfaction probability. We propose an offline and an online application of this method.",

We propose nested infinite Gaussian mixture model (iGMM) for recognizing frame based feature vectors. The main advantage is that the number of classes is allowed to increase without bound, if necessary, to represent unknown audio input. The multiple hypothesis tracking module provides time-series of separated audio stream using localized directions and recognition results at each frame. Not only for continuous sounds, the proposed tracker automatically detects appearing and disappearing point of stream from multiple hypothesis. These two modules are connected to microphone array based sound localization and separation, and the combined robot audition system achieved tracking of multiple moving sounds including intermittent sound source.",

Besides their undoubted modeling power, it is of major importance that such systems work in a stable manner. We therefore present a neural learning scheme that estimates stable dynamical systems from demonstrations based on a two-stage process: first, a data-driven Lyapunov function candidate is estimated. Second, stability is incorporated by means of a novel method to respect local constraints in the neural learning. We show in two experiments that this method is capable of learning stable dynamics while simultaneously sustaining the accuracy of the estimate and robustly generates complex movements.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a design of a class of robotic legs (known as \u201cNinja legs\u201d) that enable amphibious operation, both walking and swimming, for use on a class of hexapod robots. Amphibious legs equip the robot with a capability to explore diverse locations in the world encompassing both those that are on the ground as well as underwater. In this paper we work with a hexapod robot of the Aqua vehicle family (based on a body plan first developed by Buehler et al. [1]), which is an amphibious robot that employs legs for amphibious locomotion. Many different leg designs have been previously developed for Aqua-class vehicles, including both robust all-terrain legs for walking, and efficient flippers for swimming. But the walking legs have extremely poor thrust for swimming and the flippers are completely unsuitable for terrestrial operations. In this work we propose a single leg design with the advantages of both the walking legs and the swimming flippers. We design a cage-like circular enclosure for the flippers in order to protect the flippers during terrestrial operations. The enclosing structure also plays the role of the walking legs for terrestrial locomotion. The circular shape of the enclosure, as well, has the advantages of an offset wheel. We evaluate the performance of our design for terrestrial mobility by comparing the power efficiency and the physical speed of the robot equipped with the newly designed legs against that with the walking legs which are semi-circular in shape. The swimming performance is examined by measuring the thrust generated by newly designed legs and comparing the same with the thrust generated by the swimming flippers. In the field, we also verified that these legs are suitable for swimming through moderate surf, walking through the breakers on a beach (and thus through slurry), and onto wet and dry sand.",

        "abstract": "A method has been developed for improving sound source localization (SSL) using a microphone array from an unmanned aerial vehicle with multiple rotors, a \u201cmultirotor UAV\u201d. One of the main problems in SSL from a multirotor UAV is that the ego noise of the rotors on the UAV interferes with the audio observation and degrades the SSL performance. We employ a generalized eigenvalue decomposition-based multiple signal classification (GEVD-MUSIC) algorithm to reduce the effect of ego noise. While GEVD-MUSIC algorithm requires a noise correlation matrix corresponding to the auto-correlation of the multichannel observation of the rotor noise, the noise correlation is nonstationary due to the aerodynamic control of the UAV. Therefore, we need an adaptive estimation method of the noise correlation matrix for a robust SSL using GEVD-MUSIC algorithm. Our method uses a Gaussian process regression to estimate the noise correlation matrix in each time period from the measurements of self-monitoring sensors attached to the UAV such as the pitch-roll-yaw tilt angles, xyz speeds, and motor control values. Experiments compare our method with existing SSL methods in terms of precision and recall rates of SSL. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods, especially under high signal-to-noise-ratio conditions.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the design and evaluation of a nonlinear control scheme for multirotor helicopters that takes first-order drag effects into account explicitly. A dynamic model including the blade flapping and induced drag forces is presented. Based on this model, a hierarchical nonlinear controller is designed to actively compensates for the nonlinear effects these drag forces. Reported simulation and experimental results indicate the significant performance improvement of the proposed drag-augmented control scheme with respect to a conventional nonlinear controller. For completeness, an offline procedure allowing for efficiently identifying the drag parameters is proposed.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper we investigate the use of optimal control techniques to improve Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) for drop foot correction on hemiplegic patients. A model of the foot and the tibialis anterior muscle, the contraction of which is controlled by electrical stimulation has been established and is used in the optimal control problem. The novelty in this work is the use of the ankle accelerations and shank orientations (so-called external states) in the model, which have been measured on hemiplegic patients in a previous experiment using Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). The optimal control problem minimizes the square of muscle excitations which serves the overall goal of reducing energy consumption in the muscle. In a first step, an offline optimal control problem is solved for test purposes and shows the efficiency of the FES optimal control for drop foot correction. In a second step, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) problem - or online optimal control problem, is solved in a simulated environment. While the ulitmate goal is to use NMPC on the real system, i.e. directly on the patient, this test in simulation was meant to show the feasibility of NMPC for online drop foot correction. In the optimization problem, a set of fixed constraints of foot orientation was applied. Then, an original adaptive constraint taking into account the current ankle height, was introduced and tested. Comparisons between results under fixed and adaptive constraints highlight the advantage of the adaptive constraints in terms of energy consumption, where its quadratic sum of controls, obtained by NMPC, was three times lower than with the fixed constraint. This feasibility study was a first step in application of NMPC on real hemiplegic patients for online FES-based drop foot correction. The adaptive constraints method presents a new and efficient approach in terms of muscular energy consumption minimization.",

A dense 3D semantic model of the environment can significantly improve a number of robotic applications such as autonomous driving, navigation or localisation. Instead of using offline trained classifiers for semantic segmentation, our approach employs a data-driven, nonparametric method to parse scenes which easily scale to a large environment and generalise to different scenes. We use stereo image pairs collected from cameras mounted on a moving car to produce dense depth maps which are combined into a global 3D reconstruction using camera poses from stereo visual odometry. Simultaneously, 2D automatic semantic segmentation using a nonparametric scene parsing method is fused into the 3D model. Furthermore, the resultant 3D semantic model is improved with the consideration of moving objects in the scene. We demonstrate our method on the publicly available KITTI dataset and evaluate the performance against manually generated ground truth.",

In this paper we integrate two recently proposed algorithms in an online, near-realtime mapping and tracking system. Using the Normal Distributions Transform (NDT), a sparse Gaussian Mixture Model, for representation of 3D range scan data, we propose a frame-to-model registration and data fusion algorithm - NDT Fusion. The proposed approach uses a submap indexing system to achieve operation in arbitrarily-sized environments. The approach is evaluated on a publicly available city-block sized data set, achieving accuracy and runtime performance significantly better than current state of the art. In addition, the system is evaluated on a data set covering ten hours of operation and a trajectory of 7.2km in a real-world industrial environment, achieving centimeter accuracy at update rates of 5-10 Hz.",

        "abstract": "Industrial applications often impose hard requirements on the precision of autonomous vehicle systems. As a consequence industrial Automatically Guided Vehicle (AGV) systems still use high-cost infrastructure based positioning solutions. In this paper we propose a map based localization method that fulfills the requirements on precision and repeatability, typical for industrial application scenarios. The proposed method - Normal Distributions Transform Monte Carlo Localization (NDT-MCL) is based on a well established probabilistic framework. In a novel contribution, we formulate the MCL localization approach using the Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) as an underlying representation for both map and sensor data. By relaxing the hard discretization assumption imposed by grid-map models and utilizing the piece-wise continuous NDT representation the proposed algorithm achieves substantially improved accuracy and repeatability. The proposed NDT-MCL algorithm is evaluated using offline data sets from both a laboratory and a real-world industrial environments. Additionally, we report a comparison of the proposed algorithm to grid-based MCL and to a commercial localization system when used in a closed-loop with the control system of an AGV platform. In all tests the proposed algorithm is demonstrated to provide performance superior to that of standard grid-based MCL and comparable to the performance of the commercial infrastructure based positioning system.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Human-robot collision has drawn increasing attention in recent years and collision safety can be improved by successfully detecting collisions between a human and a robot. For a manipulator working in human environments, collisions usually occur at the manipulator body while the robot performs a contact task using its end-effector to interact with the environment. Therefore, both collision force and the force on the end-effector contribute to the external torques which can be estimated from the robot dynamics and the joint torques measured by the joint torque sensors, which means whether or not a collision has occurred cannot be reliably determined using this estimation. In this study, we propose a novel collision detection index to detect collisions independently of the end-effector force of a redundant manipulator equipped with joint torque sensors. Using the null space projection of a redundant manipulator, the collision detection index can be expressed as a function of the torque generated by a collision and the manipulator configuration. The proposed index is verified through various simulations. Simulation results show that collisions can be reliably detected regardless of the presence of the end-effector forces even in situations with external torques contaminated by substantial error.",

        "abstract": "We present an approach for object class learning using a part-based shape categorization in RGB-augmented 3D point clouds captured from cluttered indoor scenes with a Kinect-like sensor. A graph representation is used to detect and categorize object instances based on part-constellations found in scenes. No assumptions like objects being placed on planar surfaces or constraints on their poses are required. Our approach consists of the following steps: 1) a Mean-Shift-based over-segmentation of a point cloud into atomic patches; 2) use of topological and geometric features to merge surface-homogeneous atomic patches into super patches; 3) an unsupervised classification of these parts that allows to symbolically label distinctively unknown object parts by their surface-structural appearance; and finally, 4) a graph generation procedure that reflects the constellation of the detected parts from object instances of certain shape categories. Furthermore, an inference procedure is presented that processes extracted part constellations of a scene to detect and categorize object instances. Experiments with challenging, cluttered scenes show that the segmentation procedure provides salient parts of objects which lead to a good categorization performance using the graph-based constellation model concept.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an observability analysis of a vision-aided inertial navigation system (VINS) in which the camera is downward looking and observes a single point feature on the ground. In our analysis, the full INS parameter vector (including position, velocity, rotation, and inertial sensor biases) as well as the 3D position of the observed point feature are considered as state variables. In particular, we prove that the system has only three unobservable directions corresponding to global translations along the x and y axes, and rotations around the gravity vector. Hence, compared to general VINS, an advantage of using only ground features is that the vertical translation becomes observable. The findings of the theoretical analysis are validated through real-world experiments.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we combine navigation functionlike potential fields and constraint based programming to achieve obstacle avoidance in formation. Constraint based programming was developed in robotic manipulation as a technique to take several constraints into account when controlling redundant manipulators. The approach has also been generalized, and applied to other control systems such as dual arm manipulators and unmanned aerial vehicles. Navigation functions are an elegant way to design controllers with provable properties for navigation problems. By combining these tools, we take advantage of the redundancy inherent in a multi-agent control problem and are able to concurrently address features such as formation maintenance and goal convergence, even in the presence of moving obstacles. We show how the user can decide a priority ordering of the objectives, as well as a clear way of seeing what objectives are currently addressed and what are postponed. We also analyze the theoretical properties of the proposed controller. Finally, we use a set of simulations to illustrate the approach.",

One key challenge for the fusion of these sensors is sensor calibration. In this paper we present a novel extrinsic calibration algorithm based on sensor odometry. Given the time-synchronized delta poses of two sensors our technique recursively estimates the relative pose between these sensors. The method is generic in that it can be used to estimate complete 6DOF poses, given the sensors provide a 6DOF odometry, as well as 3DOF poses (planar offset and yaw angle) for sensors providing a 3DOF odometry, like a single-beam LiDAR. We show that the proposed method is robust against motion degeneracy and present results on both simulated and real world data using an inertial navigation system (INS) and a stereo camera system.",

        "abstract": "A major challenge for robot localization and mapping systems is maintaining reliable operation in a changing environment. Vision-based systems in particular are susceptible to changes in illumination and weather, and the same location at another time of day may appear radically different to a system using a feature-based visual localization system. One approach for mapping changing environments is to create and maintain maps that contain multiple representations of each physical location in a topological framework or manifold. However, this requires the system to be able to correctly link two or more appearance representations to the same spatial location, even though the representations may appear quite dissimilar. This paper proposes a method of linking visual representations from the same location without requiring a visual match, thereby allowing vision-based localization systems to create multiple appearance representations of physical locations. The most likely position on the robot path is determined using particle filter methods based on dead reckoning data and recent visual loop closures. In order to avoid erroneous loop closures, the odometry-based inferences are only accepted when the inferred path's end point is confirmed as correct by the visual matching system. Algorithm performance is demonstrated using an indoor robot dataset and a large outdoor camera dataset.",

In this paper, the control of a fleet of wheeled mobile robots, equipped with RTK-GPS sensors and communicating through WiFi, is investigated. The focus is particularly set on the control of a formation of several robots with respect to a reference trajectory, previously learned or computed off-line. Non-linear exact transformations permit to achieve a laterally and longitudinally decoupled model; from which the control of steering angle and velocity are derived separately in order to ensure the desired formation shape. Since the control of lateral distance to the reference trajectory is based on other works, only the longitudinal control is detailed in this paper. It is based on an adaptive and predictive control algorithm, in order to account for both sliding and actuator delays. The experimental results demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Gestures are characterized by intermediary or final landmarks (real or virtual) in task space or joint space that can change during the course of the motion, and that are described by varying accuracy and correlation constraints. Generalizing these trajectories in robot learning by imitation is challenging, because of the small number of demonstrations provided by the user. We present an approach to statistically encode movements in a task-parameterized mixture model, and derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to train it. The model automatically extracts the relevance of candidate coordinate systems during the task, and exploits this information during reproduction to adapt the movement in real-time to changing position and orientation of landmarks or objects. The approach is tested with a robotic arm learning to roll out a pizza dough. It is compared to three categories of task-parameterized models: 1) Gaussian process regression (GPR) with a trajectory models database; 2) Multi-streams approach with models trained in several frames of reference; and 3) Parametric Gaussian mixture model (PGMM) modulating the Gaussian centers with the task parameters. We show that the extrapolation capability of the proposed approach outperforms existing methods, by extracting the local structures of the task instead of relying on interpolation principles.",

To do so, we consider the task of constructing an occupancy grid map with a binary Bayesian filter. Using a narrow beam-based sensor model (versus an additive white Gaussian noise model), we prove that any controller tasked to maximize a mutual information reward function is eventually attracted to unexplored space. This intuitive behavior is derived solely from the geometric dependencies of the occupancy grid mapping algorithm and the monotonie properties of mutual information. Since it is a function of both the robot's position and the uncertainty of the surrounding cells, mutual information encodes geometric relationships that are fundamental to robot control, thus yielding geometrically relevant reward surfaces on which the robot can navigate. Lastly, we present the results of two experiments employing an omnidirectional ground robot equipped with a laser rangefinder.",

        "abstract": "Production speed and energy efficiency are crucial factors for any application scenario in industrial robotics. The most important factor for this is planning of an optimized sequence of atomic subtasks. In a welding scenario, an atomic subtask could be understood as a single welding seam/spot while the sequence could be the ordering of these atomic tasks. Optimization of a task sequence is normally modeled as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). This works well for simple scenarios with atomic tasks without execution freedom like spot welding. However, many types of tasks allow a certain freedom of execution. A simple example is seam welding of a closed-contour, where typically the starting-ending point is not specified by the application. This extra degree of freedom allows for much more efficient task sequencing. In this paper, we describe an extension of TSP to model a problem of finding an optimal sequence of tasks with such extra degree of freedom. We propose a new, efficient heuristic to solve such problems and show its applicability. Obtained computational results are close to the optimum on small instances and outperforms the state of the art approaches on benchmarks available in literature.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Model-based control are affected by the accuracy of dynamic calibration. For industrial robots, identification techniques predominantly involve rigid body models linearized on a set of minimal lumped parameters that are estimated along excitatory trajectories made by suitable/optimal path. Although the physical meaning of the estimated lumped models is often lost (e.g. negative inertia values), these methodologies get remarkably results when well-conditioned trajectories are applied. Nonetheless, such trajectories have usually to span the workspace at large, resulting in an averagely fitting model. In many technological tasks, instead, the region of dynamics applications is limited, and generation of trajectories in such workspace sub-region results in different specialized models that should increase the predictability of local behavior. Besides this consideration, the paper presents a genetic-based selection of trajectories in constrained sub-region. The methodology places under optimization paths generated by a commercial industrial robot interpolator, and the genes (i.e. the degrees-of-freedom) of the evolutionary algorithms corresponds to a finite set of few via-points and velocities, just like standard motion programming of industrial robots. Remarkably, experiments demonstrate that this algorithm design feature allows a good matching of foreseen current and the actual measured in different task conditions.",

To solve the problem, we employ the so-called geometric phase approach based on the fact that tracing a closed path in the space of input variables results in a non-closed path in the space of output variables. To set up the governing equations, the contact kinematic equations are modified by the condition of dynamic realizability, which constrains the component of the angular velocity of the rolling carrier and depends on the mass distribution, and parameterized. By using a motion planning strategy based on tracing two circles on the spherical surface, an exact and dynamically realizable motion planning algorithm is fabricated and verified under simulation.",

        "abstract": "Recent developments in learning sophisticated, hierarchical image representations have led to remarkable progress in the context of visual recognition. While these methods are becoming standard in modern computer vision systems, they are rarely adopted in robotics. The question arises of whether solutions, which have been primarily developed for image retrieval, can perform well in more dynamic and unstructured scenarios. In this paper we tackle this question performing an extensive evaluation of state of the art methods for visual recognition on a iCub robot. We consider the problem of classifying 15 different objects shown by a human demonstrator in a challenging Human-Robot Interaction scenario. The classification performance of hierarchical learning approaches are shown to outperform benchmark solutions based on local descriptors and template matching. Our results show that hierarchical learning systems are computationally efficient and can be used for real-time training and recognition of objects.",

On the other hand, image-based key-frame representations for dense environment mapping have been developed. Both techniques have their relative advantages and disadvantages which will be analysed in this paper. In particular each representation's space-size requirements, their effective resolution, the computation efficiency, their accuracy and robustness will be compared. This paper then proposes a new model which unifies various concepts and exhibits the main advantages of each approach within a common framework. One of the main results of the proposed approach is its ability to perform large scale reconstruction accurately at the scale of mapping a building.",

        "abstract": "Flexible minimally invasive surgical instruments can be used to target difficult-to-reach locations within the human body. Accurately steering these instruments requires information about the three-dimensional shape of the instrument. In the current study, we use an array of Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors to reconstruct the shape of a flexible instrument. FBG sensors have several advantages over existing imaging modalities, which makes them well-suited for use in a clinical environment. An experimental testbed is presented in this study, which includes a tendon-driven manipulator. A nitinol FBG-wire is fabricated, on which an array of twelve FBG sensors are integrated, and distributed over four different sets. This wire is positioned in the backbone of the manipulator. Axial strains are measured using the FBG sensors, from which the curvature of the manipulator is calculated. The three-dimensional manipulator shape is reconstructed from the curvature, which is used to steer the manipulator tip. We are able to steer the manipulator along various trajectories (two-dimensional and three-dimensional), and also reject disturbance loads. We observe a minimum mean tracking error of 0.67 mm for the circular trajectory in closed-loop control. This study demonstrates the potential of steering flexible minimally invasive surgical instruments using an array of FBG sensors.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the double generating function method for finite time linear quadratic optimal control problems was proposed. This paper applies it to the on-demand optimal gaits generation of a compass biped robot walking on the level ground. The double generating function method is employed to generate reference optimal gaits and inputs considering the energy consumption by linearizing the compass biped robot. The simulation result shows that the modeling error caused by the linearization is small when the robot walks with a reasonable step length and a appropriate time period. This implies that the optimal states and inputs for the linearized system can be treated as the optimal ones for the original nonlinear system. The biggest advantage of the double generating function method is that it can generate a parametrization of optimal gaits for different boundary conditions and different time periods. Therefore, it is very useful to generate the optimal states and inputs on demand and in real time for the real biped robots.",

        "abstract": "We describe the design and implementation of an on-line identification scheme for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). The proposed method estimates the dynamic parameters of the vehicle based on a global derivative-free optimization algorithm. It is not sensitive to initial conditions, unlike other on-line identification schemes, and does not depend on the differentiability of the model with respect to the parameters. The identification scheme consists of three distinct modules: a) System Excitation, b) Metric Calculator and c) Optimization Algorithm. The System Excitation module sends excitation inputs to the vehicle. The Optimization Algorithm module calculates a candidate parameter vector, which is fed to the Metric Calculator module. The Metric Calculator module evaluates the candidate parameter vector, using a metric based on the residual of the actual and the predicted commands. The predicted commands are calculated utilizing the candidate parameter vector and the vehicle state vector, which is available via a complete navigation module. Then, the metric is directly fed back to the Optimization Algorithm module, and it is used to correct the estimated parameter vector. The procedure continues iteratively until the convergence properties are met. The proposed method is generic, demonstrates quick convergence and does not require a linear formulation of the model with respect to the parameter vector. The applicability and performance of the proposed algorithm is experimentally verified using the AUV Girona 500.",

It combines onboard perception with two locomotion strategies, a dynamic trot and a static crawl gait. This way the robot can perceive its environment and arbitrate between the two behaviours according to the situation at hand. All computations are performed on-board and are carried out in two separate computers, one handles the high-level processes while the other is concerned with the low-level hard real-time control. The perception and subsequently the appropriate gait modifications are performed autonomously. We present outdoor experimental trials of the robot trotting over unknown terrain, perceiving a large obstacle, altering its behaviour to the cautious crawl gait and stepping onto the obstacle. This allows the robot to locomote quickly on relatively flat terrain and gives the robot the ability to overcome large irregular obstacles when required.",

Initially more fragile and larger than their human counterparts, the technology has evolved and the latest generation is close to the human hand in size and robustness. However, it is still disappointing to see how little robotic hands are able to do once the grasp is acquired due to the difficulty to obtain a reliable pose of the object within the palm. This paper presents a novel method based on a particle filter used to estimate online the object pose. It is shown that the method is robust, accurate and handles many realistic scenario without hand crafted rules. It combines an efficient collision checker with a few very simple ideas, that require only a basic knowledge of the geometry of the objects. It is shown, by experiments and simulations, that the algorithm is able to deal with inaccurate finger position measurements and can integrate tactile measurements. The method greatly enhances the performance of common manipulation operations, such as a pick and place tasks, and boosts the sensing capabilities of the robot.",

We propose an efficient stochastic online learning algorithm based on the online Expectation Maximization (EM), as well as a generation and decay scheme for model components. Our method is suitable for complex robotic applications, where data is abundant or where we wish to iteratively refine our model and conduct predictions during the course of learning. With a synthetic example, we show that the algorithm can achieve higher numerical stability. We also empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our method in well-known regression benchmark datasets. Under a trajectory Learning by Demonstration setting we employ a multi-shot learning application in joint angle space, where we observe higher quality of learning and reproduction. We compare against popular and well-established methods, widely adopted across the robotics community.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel technique for online generating trajectories in the 3-D space is presented. The trajectory planner is based on cubic B-splines. However, while the definition of B-splines requires the solution of a global problem that involves the entire set of via-points to be interpolated/approximated, and therefore it is not suitable for online implementation, the proposed generator is able to approximate spline functions with the prescribed precision on the basis of local computations, which only need the knowledge of a very limited number of via-points. FIR filters are the foundation of this result. As a matter of fact the planner is composed by a first FIR filter for the computation of the control points from the sequence of desired via-points, followed by a chain of moving average filters. Therefore, the generator combines the characteristics of B-spline trajectories (smoothness and minimum curvature) and those of FIR filters (simple structure and computational efficiency). Moreover, besides standard cubic curves, the so-called smoothing B-splines have been considered for online trajectory generation. This allows to find a tradeoff between the possibility of exactly crossing the given via-points and the smoothness of the resulting trajectory. A simple teleoperation task with a Puma 560 industrial manipulator has been arranged for experimentally validating the proposed method.",

We do not assume any knowledge of the analytical forward and inverse kinematics, relying instead on learning these models online, while executing a desired task. Specifically, we employ a recent learning algorithm that allows to learn a probabilistic model from which both the forward and inverse solutions can be obtained, as well as the Jacobian of the kinematics map. Such learned model can then be used to implement both types of control. Moreover, the multi-valued solutions provided by the learned model can be applied to redundant systems in which an infinite number of inverse solutions may exist. We present experiments with a simulated version of the iCub, a highly redundant humanoid robot, in which this learned model is employed to execute both open-loop and closed-loop trajectory control. We show the advantages and drawbacks of both control strategies, and we propose a way to combine them to deal with sensor noise and failures, showing the benefits of using a learning algorithm that can simultaneously provide forward and inverse predictions.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a methodology to control a novel class of actuators that we called passive noise rejection variable stiffness actuators (pnrVSA). Differently from nowadays classical VSA designs, this novel class of actuators mimics the human musculoskeletal ability to increase noise rejection without relying on feedback. To fully highlight the potentialities behind these actuators we consider movement planning under two constraints: (1) absence of feedback, i.e. purely open-loop planning1; (2) uncertain dynamic model. Under these constraints, movement planning can be formalized as an open-loop stochastic optimal control. Due to the lack of classical methods forcing the open-loop nature of the computed solution, we used here a slight modification of available methodologies based on importance sampling of trajectories using forward diffusion processes. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm can be effectively used to plan open-loop movements with pnrVSA. In particular, two different scenarios are considered: the control of a single joint pnrVSA and the control of a two degrees of freedom planar arm equipped with antagonist pnrVSAs at each joint. In both cases, movement has to be planned in presence of uncertain dynamics for unstable tasks. It is shown that open-loop stochastic optimal control can modulate the intrinsic stiffness of the system to cope with both instability and noise.",

        "abstract": "Keeping balance is the main concern for humanoids in standing and walking tasks. This paper endeavors to acquire optimal ankle stabilization methods for humanoids with passive and active compliance and explain ankle balancing strategy from the compliance regulation perspective. Unlike classical stiff humanoids, the compliant ones can control both impedance and position during task operation. Optimal compliance regulation is resolved to maximize the stability of the humanoids. The linearized model is proposed to obtain the optimal ankle impedance for stabilizing against impacts. The nonlinear model is proposed as well and compared with the linear one. The proposed methods are validated by experiments on an intrinsically compliant humanoid using passivity based admittance and impedance controllers both in joint and Cartesian space.",

The present article investigates control design of a single degree of freedom haptic device that is interacting with a human operator and rendering a virtual wall affected by time delay. To this end, it suggests different optimization criteria based on the step response of the haptic system. These criteria cover fundamental requirements for efficiently using haptic devices, particularly fast settling and minimum overshoot. For each criterion an optimal path and point inside the stable region of the virtual wall parameters is derived. These optima depend mainly on the system mass, sampling time and time delay. This approach is supported by experiments on two devices, a Falcon haptic device and a DLR/KUKA Light-Weight Robot arm.",

Modeling of the contacts is discussed using a state vector of the coupled robot and object dynamics. Robustness against uncertainty due to varying model parameters such as object inertia and friction between the end-effector and the object is investigated. An approach for obtaining manifolds of terminal constraints from the goal configuration is described. Classification of these constraints is given. Finally, feasible trajectory generation conditions for successful execution of the generated optimal controls are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Humanoid robots should be able to visually recognize objects and estimate their 6D pose in real environmental conditions with their limited sensor capabilities. In order to achieve these visual skills, it is necessary to establish an optimal visual transducer connecting the scene layout with the internal representations of objects and places. This visual transducer should capture the noiseless visual manifold of the scene with high-dynamic-range in an efficient manner. Our endeavor is to develop such a visual transducer using the widespread LDR cameras in humanoid robots. In our previous work, the noiseless acquisition of continuous images [1] and the improved radio-metric calibration [2] already enabled the humanoid robots to attain the desired visual manifold in terms of quality. However, since the radiance range of the scene can be very wide, the required amount of exposures to capture the visual manifold (robustly without radiance inconsistencies) turns impractically large in terms of scope, granularity and acquisition time. In this article, a method for estimating the minimal amount of exposures and their particular integration times is presented. This method integrates our previous work in order to synthesize HDR images with the minimal amount of exposures while ensuring the high quality of the resulting image. Conclusively, the minimal exposure set provides performance improvements without quality trade-off. Experimental evaluation is presented with the humanoid robots ARMAR-III a, b [3].",

One of the limitations of fixed-wing UAVs in tracking mobile targets is the lack of hovering capability when the target moves much slower than the minimum UAV speed, requiring the UAV maintain an orbit about the target. In this paper, we propose a method to find the optimal policy for fixed-wing UAVs to minimize the location uncertainty of a mobile target. Using a grid-based Markov Decision Process (MDP), we use an off-line policy iteration algorithm to find an optimal UAV path in a coarse discretized state space, followed by an on-line policy iteration algorithm that applies a finer grid MDP to the region of interest to find the final optimal UAV trajectory. We validate the proposed algorithm using computer simulations. Comparing the simulation results with other methods, we show that the proposed method has up to 13% decrease in error uncertainty than ones resulted using conventional methods.",

Experimental and simulated results use a robotic electrosense platform to localize a feature in one-dimension. We demonstrate that this method is robust with respect to disturbances and initial conditions, and results in successful localization of the feature with a 100% experimental success rate and a 34% reduction in localization time compared to the next best tested controller.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Swing leg retraction, the backward rotation of the swing leg prior to heel-strike, is known to have several advantages in legged locomotion. To achieve this motion, a hip torque is required at the end of the swing phase to brake the forward rotation of the leg and/or accelerate its backward motion. In walking, pre-emptive push-off of the stance leg also occurs at the end of the swing, so its relative timing with late-swing retracting torque influences gait energetics. To find the best relative timing between the stance leg's push-off force and the swing leg retraction torque, we calculate their work-based energetics in a simple bipedal model using impulsive approximations and with the aid of the so-called overlap parameter that quantifies the relative order and the percentage overlap of the push-off and retraction impulses. By minimizing the energetic cost of the gait, we found that it is energetically favorable to start with the push-off force, and postpone braking the leg swing until completely after the push-off (impulsive force/torque). The implication for the more realistic non-impulsive cases is to apply the retraction torque at the very end of the push-off before heel-strike.

        "abstract": "The common view on feedforward control is that it needs an accurate model in order to accurately predict a future state of the system. However, in this paper we show that there are model inaccuracies that do not affect the final position of a motion, when using the right feedforward controller. Having an accurate final position is the main requirement in the task we consider: a pick-and-place task. We optimized the feedforward controllers such that the effect of model inaccuracies on the final position was minimized. The system we studied is a one DOF robotic arm in the horizontal plane, of which we show simulation and hardware results. The results show that the errors in the final position can be reduced to approximately zero for an inaccurate Coulomb, viscous or torque dependent friction. Furthermore, errors in the final position can be reduced, but not to zero, for an inaccurate inertia or motor constant. In conclusion, we show that for certain model inaccuracies, no feedback is required to eliminate the effect of an inaccurate model on the final position of a motion.",

A feature learning algorithm combined with a conditional random field is applied to multi-spectral image data. Current classification methods used in agriculture scenarios tend to use hand crafted application-based features. In contrast, our approach uses unsupervised feature learning to automatically capture most relevant features from the data. This property makes our approach robust against variance in canopy trees and therefore has the potential to be applied to different domains. The proposed algorithm is applied to a fruit segmentation problem for a robotic agricultural surveillance mission, aiming to provide yield estimation with high accuracy and robustness against fruit variance. Experimental results with data collected in an almond farm are shown. The segmentation is performed with features extracted from multi-spectral (colour and infrared) data. We achieve a global classification accuracy of 88%.",

        "abstract": "It has become a well-known technology that 3D measurement of a large environment could be achieved by using a number of 2D LIDARs on a mobile platform. In such a system, calibration is essential for making collaborative use of different LIDAR data, while existing methods usually require modifications to the environments, such as putting calibration targets, or rely on special facilities, which is labor intensive and put many restrictions to potential applications. This research aims at developing a calibration method for multiple 2D LIDAR sensing systems, which could be conducted in a general outdoor environment using the features of a nature scene. Special focus is cast on solving the noisy sensing in a complex environment and the occlusions caused by largely different sensor viewpoints. A multi-type geometric feature based calibration algorithm is proposed, which extracts the features such as points, lines, planes and quadrics from the 3D points of each LIDAR sensing. Transformation parameters from each sensor to the frame on a moving platform is estimated by matching the multi-type features. Experiments are conducted using the data sets of an intelligent vehicle platform (POSS-V) through a driving in the campus of Peking University. Results of calibrating two LIDAR sensors with largely different viewpoints are presented, and the accuracy and robustness concerning noisy feature extractions are examined intensively.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the challenging 1-to-N map matching problem, which exploits a compact description of map data, to improve the scalability of map matching techniques used by various robot vision tasks. We propose a first method explicitly aimed at fast succinct map matching, which consists only of map-matching subtasks. These tasks include offline map matching attempts to find a compact part-based scene model that effectively explains each map using fewer larger parts. The tasks also include an online map matching attempt to efficiently find correspondence between the part-based maps. Our part-based scene modeling approach is unsupervised and uses common pattern discovery (CPD) between the input and known reference maps. This enables a robot to learn a compact map model without human intervention. We also present a practical implementation that uses the state-of-the-art CPD technique of randomized visual phrases (RVP) with a compact bounding box (BB) based part descriptor, which consists of keypoint and descriptor BBs. The results of our challenging map-matching experiments, which use a publicly available radish dataset, show that the proposed approach achieves successful map matching with significant speedup and a compact description of map data that is tens of times more compact. Although this paper focuses on the standard 2D pointset map and the BB-based part representation, we believe our approach is sufficiently general to be applicable to a broad range of map formats, such as the 3D point cloud map, as well as to general bounding volumes and other compact part representations.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we address the problem of visibility in position-based visual servoing. It is well known that the observed object may leave the field of view in such schemes, as there is usually no control in the image. Recent control schemes try to cope with this issue by defining an image-based constraint such that the object stays in the image. We propose to increase the convergence domain of such schemes by defining a new constraint that allows the observed object to leave partially the field of view. The general formulation is exposed and the computation of this constraint is detailed. Experiments show that controlling the visibility loss allows performing position-based visual servoing tasks that were impossible to perform while keeping the whole object in the image.",

The collision suppression mechanism consists of a release air pad, a transmission rack, a clutch gear and a compression spring. An air cushion bag is attached to the exterior of the robot manipulator. If a robot manipulator collides with an object or human when a task is performed, the collision force suppression mechanism disjoints the specific joint corresponding to the direction of the collision force to reduce the collision force. The robot manipulator will then return to the former task when the colliding object is eliminated. Through collision experiments, the effectiveness of the collision force suppression mechanism is verified.",

        "abstract": "It was clarified that limit cycle walkers can improve the gait efficiency by using the oscillatory effect of a wobbling mass moving in the body frame. In this research, we investigate the effects of a 2-DOF wobbling mass on the gait properties. As the simplest walker for analysis, we introduce the model of a planar eight-legged rimless wheel (RW) with a passive 2-DOF wobbling mass that is connected to the RW incorporating a spring and a damper. Through numerical simulations, we analyze changes in the gait properties with respect to the system parameters such as the slope angle and the elastic coefficient. Furthermore, entrainment to a wobbling mass motion actively controlled to rotate is also investigated.",

First, the existence of self-stable cyclic bounding gaits in the presence of torso flexibility is examined. Based on numerical studies of the associated Poincar\u00e9 return map in a dimensionless context, it is deduced that self-stable bounding gaits can indeed be generated through appropriate combinations of the stiffness of the torso and the stiffness of the legs. Next, the implications of this result to control design are discussed, and a hybrid controller is proposed that enhances the stability of the passively generated bounding gaits.",

This scenario introduces a series of safety issues which are uncommon in industrial settings where physical separation of robot areas is typically enforced. While several approaches for safe human-robot interaction exist, none of them can be easily integrated with production constraints. This paper discusses the composition of safety constraints with production ones. An algorithm is derived in order to maximize productivity, while guaranteeing a safe separation distance of the robot from the human. Experimental results showing the effectiveness of the approach in a typical industrial setting are also discussed.",

As most of mobile robots are with nonholonomic constraints, it is difficult for us to make them converge to the target state with a control law. To solve this problem, many methods have been proposed. One of them is Path-generating Regulator(PGR) which designs a nonlinear regulator carrying out asymptotic convergence to a given trajectory family. However, the original method is not well suited for passages. In this paper, we will present the extended PGR for the tracking problem along a straight passage. Numerical simulations and experiments are also performed to show the effectiveness of this method.",

In this paper we propose an autonomous risk-detection system for a master-slave surgical robotic system in order to estimate a property of an object (i.e., contact impedance) using a force sensor mounted on a surgical robotic instrument. The system autonomously detects the risk based on the estimated contact impedance and accordingly activates the motion at the slave unit as well as the force feedback at the master unit. We implemented the proposed method in a teleoperated master-slave system to detect the perforation risk of a membranous object. The performance of the system was evaluated through experiments. The classification accuracy for perforation risk was about 98.5 % in fourfold cross-validation. The experiments verified that the risk detection system accurately detected the perforation risk and improved the safety of the master-slave system.",

Our group recently developed new underwater sensors based on pinniped whiskers, which not only exploit their characteristic geometries but also the dynamics of whisker follicles to improve and tailor sensing capabilities. The sensors are simple, robust, and a straightforward methodology can be used to tailor their sensitivity to different target signals. A lumped parameter model is used to predict sensor performance. The model predictions for static scenarios are compared to experimental results for constant speed measurements. Scalings for static and dynamic measurement scenarios are also given. In both cases the sensors show a strong sensitivity to follicle material properties and whisker length. The results show the sensors can be used for flow sensing and are a promising feedback source for navigation based on near field hydrodynamic features.",

The research and development of PRs (personal robots) that improve the quality of human life is needed in order to accommodate the aging society. Elderly people will be able to spend their lives happily and effortlessly with the aid of useful and convenient PRs. However, excessive or premature use of PRs may cause health deterioration or contribute to the quick aging phenomenon. In this paper, a new prototype PR is proposed that can follow human beings with their baggage. Elderly people, therefore, will be able to go outside empty handed to shop, enjoy the fresh air, and visit friends. This PR will encourage people to walk outside and can eventually support an active lifestyle in its true sense. For actual use, PRs should have both a small footprint for coexistence in human society and high traveling performance for following the human wherever they go. Active posture control for the roll and pitch angles is applied to the PR to realize these requirements. The proposed structure and control approach using lateral acceleration as a control variable is verified by experiment using the new prototype robot.",

The goal is to develop a process which produces standard 3D models from indoors to explore them virtually. Camera motion is tracked in 3D space by registering the current view with a reference view. Depending on the trajectory shape, the reference is either fetched from a concurrently built keyframe model or from a previous RGB-D measurement. Realtime tracking (30Hz) is executed on a low-end GPU, which is possible because structural data is not fused concurrently. After camera poses have been estimated, both trajectory and structure are refined in post-processing. The global point cloud is compressed into a watertight polygon mesh by using Poisson reconstruction method. The Poisson method is well-suited, because it compressed the raw data without introducing multiple geometries and also fills holes efficiently. Holes are typically introduced at occluded regions. Texturing is generated by backprojecting the nearest RGB image onto the mesh.

The physical contact expressions are generated through a combination of several haptic stimuli and the robot's anthropomorphic behaviors based on its internal state. The aim of our research is building a caregiver-like robot medium. The system was designed for gentle and delicate communication between the user and the robot during a user's outings. The haptic stimuli express warm/cold, patting, and squeezing. Experimental results show that haptic communicative behaviors of the robot increase the intelligibility to the robot's messages and familiar impressions to the robot.",

Due to model and data errors, physically impossible parameters can arise with classical estimations methods. Such infeasible estimations cannot be used in robot control or simulation. This paper proposes a semidefinite programming (SDP) reformulation of the classical ordinary least squares method. This enables the inclusion of constraints guaranteeing physically feasible solutions only. The SDP method efficiently finds the feasible solution with the lowest regression error. Regression data processing issues related to the WAM robot are also addressed.",

We posit that a robot needs to divide its attention between multiple users and may be able to use its gaze to \u2018point\u2019 at objects of interest. A 2 (person-oriented [only looking at participants] vs. object-oriented [also looking at artworks] gaze) \u00d7 2 (\u2018favored\u2019 [looked at more] vs. \u2018not favored\u2019 [looked at less] by the robot) mixed factorial design (N=57) study was carried out in a museum-like lab setting where a robot talked about two artworks to groups of three participants. Results indicate that \u2018favored\u2019 participants did indeed pay more attention to the robot and the artworks. However, surprisingly they paid more attention when the robot did not look over to the object of interest compared to when it did give this gaze cue. The findings suggest that using an object-oriented gaze as a cue for people to look at an object may not carry across readily from person-to-person to human-robot communication. People had trouble interpreting the cue and were possibly distracted by the robot's movement.",

However, the inkjet head was originally design for color ink. Therefore, problems, such as, head clogging and trajectory error occurred. In this study, those problems were addressed, and optimal condition for stable cells ejection was verified. Furthermore, one cell per one droplet printing method was established by observing cells position on the inside of inkjet head. Finally, automatic one cell per one droplet printing system was successfully developed by processing image of the inkjet head to automatically detect cells position. The automatic one cell per one droplet printing system was successfully developed with 98% successful ratio.",

A forward facing fisheye camera mounted on a prototype robot collects imagery as it is teleoperated through a pipe network. The images are processed offline to estimate camera pose and sparse scene structure where the results can be used to generate 3D renderings of the pipe surface. The method extends state of the art visual odometry and mapping for fisheye systems to incorporate geometric constraints based on prior knowledge of the pipe components into a Sparse Bundle Adjustment framework. These constraints significantly reduce inaccuracies resulting from the limited spatial resolution of the fisheye imagery, limited image texture, and visual aliasing. Preliminary results are presented for datasets collected in our fiberglass pipe network which demonstrate the validity of the approach.",

Furthermore, the robots are allocated specific times to reach their respective goal locations and as a result they have to decide which robots have to visit which waypoints. Such a problem has the challenge of computing the allocation of waypoints across robots, ordering for these waypoints and dynamical feasibility of the paths between waypoints. We present an algorithm that runs a series of graph searches to solve the problem and provide theoretical analysis that our approach yields an optimal solution. We present simulated results as well as experiments on two UAVs that validate the capability of our algorithm. For a single robot, we can solve instances having 10\u201315 waypoints and for multiple robots, instances having five robots and 10 waypoints can be solved.",

Their operation is based on rotating and telescopically actuating concentric tubes to achieve robot tip pose control. During tube manipulation, the elastic energy stored in the robot structure may give rise to unstable robot configurations and loss of control. This can occur, in particular, for highly curved and elongated tubes that are required for certain surgical interventions. This paper presents a path planning methodology that allows the utilization of such generally unstable concentric tube robots by ensuring that they operate in their stable configuration regions.",

Capable of accelerating from 0 to 100 km h-1 in three seconds, the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is still a mystery which intrigues scientists. Aiming for a better understanding of the source of such higher speeds, we develop a biomimetic platform, where musculoskeletal parameters (range of motion and moment arms) from the biological system can be evaluated with air muscles within a lightweight robotic structure. We performed experiments validating the muscular structure during a treadmill walk, successfully reproducing animal locomotion while adopting an EMG based control method.",

In this paper, we propose an algorithm which allows the robot to avoid obstacles and to reach the assigned goal as long as the goal does not lie within obstacles. For this purpose, dynamical system modulation approach is adopted which ensures the avoidance of convex and concave obstacles. A modulation matrix can be calculated directly from the point cloud data of obstacles in the scene, without the need of analytical representation of the obstacles. This matrix modulates a generic first order dynamical system, used to generate the goal. In this way we guarantee the obstacles avoidance and the reaching of the goal. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated with numerical simulations and experiments on a 7 DOF KUKA light weight arm.",

        "abstract": "Robust visual tracking is an essential precursor to understanding and replicating human actions in robotic systems. In order to accurately evaluate the semantic meaning of a sequence of video frames, or to replicate an action contained therein, one must be able to coherently track and segment all observed agents and objects. This work proposes a novel online point cloud based algorithm which simultaneously tracks 6DoF pose and determines spatial extent of all entities in indoor scenarios. This is accomplished using a persistent supervoxel world-model which is updated, rather than replaced, as new frames of data arrive. Maintenance of a world model enables general object permanence, permitting successful tracking through full occlusions. Object models are tracked using a bank of independent adaptive particle filters which use a supervoxel observation model to give rough estimates of object state. These are united using a novel multi-model RANSAC-like approach, which seeks to minimize a global energy function associating world-model supervoxels to predicted states. We present results on a standard robotic assembly benchmark for two application scenarios \u2014 human trajectory imitation and semantic action understanding \u2014 demonstrating the usefulness of the tracking in intelligent robotic systems.",

With this interface, a user wearing a head-mounted display is able to cycle through the real-time video streams originating from the robots' cameras. The user is also able to select a robot and remotely position it by simply walking or turning his/her head, i.e., control the robot's motion in a master/slave-type fashion. We report the results of an initial hardware experiment where a user located in the USA is tasked to position two quadrotor robots within a motion capture laboratory located in Germany. These results suggest that P&P is a feasible approach to remotely inspect disaster affected sites. Lastly, we conduct a user study to compare P&P with a baseline interface composed of a traditional computer monitor and a video game controller. The quantitative results and qualitative discussions resulting from this user study highlight how such multi-robot interfaces can be further improved.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the problem of estimating the state of an object during manipulation. Contact sensors provide valuable information about the object state during actions which involve persistent contact, e.g. pushing. However, contact sensing is very discriminative by nature, and therefore the set of object states that contact a sensor constitutes a lower-dimensional manifold in the state space of the object. This causes stochastic state estimation methods, such as particle filters, to perform poorly when contact sensors are used. We propose a new algorithm, the manifold particle filter, which uses dual particles directly sampled from the contact manifold to avoid this problem. The algorithm adapts to the probability of contact by dynamically changing the number of dual particles sampled from the manifold. We compare our algorithm to the conventional particle filter through extensive experiments and we show that our algorithm is both faster and better at estimating the state. Unlike the conventional particle filter, our algorithm's performance improves with increasing sensor accuracy and the filter's update rate. We implement the algorithm on a real robot using commercially available tactile sensors to track the pose of a pushed object.",

By utilizing scattering transformation with an input-output passive controller, it is demonstrated that the flexible-joint robotic control system can be stabilized when there are time delays in the communication channels. Although stabilization is achieved, the flexible-joint robot cannot be regulated to the desired configuration when utilizing the scattering variables. Hence, a new control framework without scattering transformation is subsequently studied in this paper to guarantee both stability and position regulation provided that the control gain is appropriately selected based on a bound on the time delays. The proposed control algorithms are validated via numerical examples on a two-link flexible-joint robotic manipulator.",

The hose-shaped robots, one of major rescue robots, have problems with navigation because their posture is too flexible for a remote operator to control to go as far as desired. For navigational and mission usability, the posture estimation of the hose-shaped robot is essential. We developed a posture estimation method with a microphone array and small loudspeakers equipped on the hose-shaped robot. Our method consists of two steps: (1) playing a known sound from the loudspeaker one-by-one, and (2) estimating the microphone positions on the hose-shaped robot instead of estimating the posture directly. We designed a time difference of arrival (TDOA) estimation method to be robust against directional noise and implemented a prototype system using a posture model of the hose-shaped robot and an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The validity of our approach is evaluated by the experiments with both signals recorded in an anechoic chamber and simulated data.",

        "abstract": "We describe a system that recognizes human postures with heavy self-occlusion. In particular, we address posture recognition in a robot assisted-living scenario, where the environment is equipped with a top-view camera for monitoring human activities. This setup is very useful because top-view cameras lead to accurate localization and limited inter-occlusion between persons, but conversely they suffer from body parts being frequently self-occluded. The conventional way of posture recognition relies on good estimation of body part positions, which turns out to be unstable in the top-view due to occlusion and foreshortening. In our approach, we learn a posture descriptor for each specific posture category. The posture descriptor encodes how well the person in the image can be `explained' by the model. The postures are subsequently recognized from the matching scores returned by the posture descriptors. We select the state-of-the-art approach of pose estimation as our posture descriptor. The results show that our method is able to correctly classify 79.7% of the test sample, which outperforms the conventional approach by over 23%.",

On the other hand, the bicycle with toddlers tends to be less-stable when start moving, low-speed biking and abrupt steering because it is hard to steer due to increasing the moment of inertia of the handlebars. Hence this study proposes a power steering system for electrically-assisted bicycles riding with a toddler. The power steering system is designed to allow a rider to steer the handlebars with a toddler as if steer the handlebars without him. The power steering system is mounted on a real bicycle, and its effectiveness is verified through experiments.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a practical framework to estimate whether or not a grapple installed in demolition machines is in a grasp state. Object grasp is a highly difficult task that requires safe and precise operations, so identifying a grasp or non-grasp state is important for assisting an operator. These types of outdoor machines lack visual and tactile sensors, so the proposed framework adopts practically available lever operation and cylinder pressure sensors. The grasp is formed by a grasp motion, which is operations to make the grapple pinch an object, and the grasp state, where the grapple holds the object in any manipulator movements. Thus, the framework determinately confirms the grasp motion through the requisite conditions defined by using sequential changes of binarized operation and pressure data for the grapple and the manipulator, and stochastically confirms the grasp state through the enhancement conditions defined by using force and movement vectors including vertical downward force, movement in the longer direction, and horizontal reciprocating movement. The results of experiments conducted to transport objects using an instrumented hydraulic arm indicated that the proposed framework is effective for identifying grasp/non-grasp with high accuracy, independently of various operators and environments.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we demonstrate a preliminary motion before grasping by a robot hand, for adjusting the object-fingertip distance and 2-axis postures simultaneously, using a Resistor Network Structure Proximity sensor (RNSP sensor). Through this motion (called \u201cpre-shaping\u201d) and the grasping of an object, the surface of each fingertip is brought into contact with the object surface so that in the next stage grasping can be undertaken. In the next stage, a force can be applied from the fingertips onto the object surface directly. The pre-shaping enhances the reliability of the feedback control for the after-contact tactile sensors. To realize the pre-shaping, we use fingertips equipped with RNSP sensors, which can detect the distance between the fingertip and the object, to determine the relative position between fingertips and an object. The RNSP sensor has a fast response (<1 [ms]) and simple connectivity (only 6 wires), and can be mounted easily. Additionally, a characteristics of the RNSP sensor output can be designed by the arrangement of the sensor elements. To perform the pre-shaping by simple sensor feedback control based on the configuration between the fingertip and object, we designed the RNSP sensor so that it had the appropriate characteristics for the pre-shaping.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes outdoor localization for a mobile robot using precise point positioning (PPP) based on the Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) L-band Experiment (LEX) signal. For autonomous navigation applications, a real-time kinematic (RTK) global positioning system (GPS) technique is widely used to estimate user position with high-precision accuracy in real time. However, RTK-GPS requires a reference station, and there are data acquisition costs involved in estimating the position. Our approach corrects position error by applying PPP using the QZSS LEX message. PPP can estimate a single receiver position without any reference station or baseline, through use of satellite position fixing and clocks. We developed a method for extracting the QZSS LEX message in real time using a software GNSS receiver. We then constructed the PPP framework based on an LEX message containing the satellite ephemeris and clock errors. Finally, we conducted field experiments to evaluate the accuracy and precision of our proposed method. The experimental results confirmed that our method made a localization precision of 1.29 m possible without using a GNSS reference station.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel methodology for planning the movements of a robotic hand when a precision grasp is going to be performed. The approach used is based on the standard Fast Marching Square (FM2) path planning method and its application to robot formations motion planning. In this case, the hand is considered to be a kinematic chain in which a mobile robot is located at every joint position. The robot formation is therefore deformable among the positions allowed by the mechanical limits of the joints. To perform a given precision grasp, the task is divided into two phases. First the hand approaches the object. FM2 is used to calculate a fast and smooth path towards the object to be grasped. While the hand is covering it, the formation updates its shape according to the map of velocities calculated in FM2. The second phase consists on performing the precision grasp. Every finger is modelled as a robot formation and a path is calculated for each fingertip so that they reach the grasping points on the object. The position of the joints of the fingers is computed using an inverse kinematics algorithm. Simulations show the usefulness of this approach thanks to a good performance of the approaching and the grasping tasks.",

        "abstract": "It is challenging for a robot acting in the world to interact with and use novel objects. While a person may be able to look past visual differences and recognize the intended function of an object, doing so is more difficult for robots, which tend to rely on visual similarity to recognize categories of objects. A robot that recognizes and classifies objects based on their functional properties and potential capabilities is better prepared to use unknown objects. We propose a technique for functionally classifying objects using features obtained through physical simulations. The described method simulates spheres falling onto an object from above. We show how a feature vector can be derived from the results of the physics-based simulation, and that this feature vector is informative for a variety of affordance classification tasks. This process allows a robot equipped with a 3D sensor to determine the functionality of objects in its environment given only a few training examples from various function classes. We show that this method is able to accurately learn membership of 3D models in three function classes: \u201cdrinking vessel\u201d, \u201ctable\u201d, and \u201csittable\u201d. We then show that this can be extended to 3D scans of objects using the models as training examples.",

        "abstract": "As a preliminary step to achieve a long-term goal of developing an automatic dental preparation system for clinical operations, we design and build a miniature robotic system which can manipulate a laser beam to move in three dimensional spaces to remove hard tissue from a target tooth. The dental preparation requires the robotic system to own high accuracy, high ablation speed and small size. A 2D galvanometer scanners module is integrated to meet the requirement of a high moving speed of the laser focus. A closed-loop system based on a miniature-sized voice-coil motor and a grating ruler are developed to realize the accurate control of the focus. The overall size of the developed prototype is 108mm\u00d756mm\u00d743mm, which is small enough to be used in close proximity to a patient's mouth. The prototype has been tested by using two different kinds of laser generators, i.e., a nanosecond laser and a picosecond laser. The experiment results show that the robotic system can provide high moving speed of 1000mm/s with good shape accuracy. From the results, we found that nanosecond laser beam can be controlled to ablate zirconia and aluminum, but not suitable to ablate tooth because of tissue carbonization. By selecting suitable parameters of the picosecond laser generator, a target tooth could be ablated to produce a cylinder shape without carbonization. Limitations of the prototype are identified according to the experiment results.",

        "abstract": "For more dexterous and agile legged robot locomotion, alternative actuation has been one of the most long-awaited technologies. The goal of this paper is to investigate the use of newly developed actuator, the so-called Linear Multi-Modal Actuator (LMMA), in the context of legged robot locomotion, and analyze the behavioral performance of it. The LMMA consists of three discrete couplings which enable the system to switch between different mechanical dynamics such as instantaneous switches between series elastic and fully actuated dynamics. To test this actuator for legged locomotion, this paper introduces a one-legged robot platform we developed to implement the actuator, and explains a novel control strategy for hopping, i.e. \u201cpreloaded hopping control\u201d. This control strategy takes advantage of the coupling mechanism of the LMMA to preload the series elasticity during the flight phase to improve the energy efficiency of hopping locomotion. This paper shows a series of experimental results that compare the control strategy with a simple sinusoidal actuation strategy to discuss the benefits and challenges of the proposed approach.",

This work introduces the preview coordination execution model, an extension to the traditional way in which the execution of such task specifications is coordinated at runtime. Instead of taking activities one-by-one as defined in the task specification model, preview coordination optimizes the task scheduling based on knowledge about the likelihood that not just the activities required by the current state can be executed, but that also one or more of those related to future states of the system can be activated. An experiment with mobile manipulation tasks illustrates the benefits of preview coordination.",

        "abstract": "We report the first experimental results of the navigation method of multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for wide seafloor surveys proposed by us in our previous reports. The key idea of the proposed method is that moving AUVs estimate their states (horizontal position and heading angle) based on AUVs remaining stationary on the seafloor (landmark AUVs), alternating between these roles to expand the observational coverage. Moving AUVs land on the seafloor and transmit compressed information about their estimated states to the landmark AUVs when they change the roles. Sea trials were carried out using two AUVs to evaluate the performance of this method. One is the AUV Tri-Dog 1 (TD) which can move and estimate the states and the other is a Dummy AUV (DA) which cannot move but can estimate the states. In the experiments, TD and DA alternatively estimated the states. To evaluate the positioning accuracy of the proposed method, the states were recalculated based on sensor data obtained at sea trials in post processing. As a result, positioning errors of the proposed method were estimated to be smaller than dead reckoning. The Errors were found to be about 0.4 m in horizontal position and about 1.5 degree in heading angle. The method demonstrated to be successful in stable positioning with AUVs alternating between the moving role and the landmark role. Future works include the verification of the method using two AUVs in sea environment to realize wide seafloor survey.",

        "abstract": "For collision avoidance systems to be accepted by human drivers, it is important to keep the rate of unnecessary interventions very low. This is challenging since the decision to intervene or not is based on incomplete and uncertain information. The contribution of this paper is a decision making strategy for collision avoidance systems which allows the system to occasionally postpone a decision in order to collect more information. The problem is formulated in the framework of statistical decision theory, and the core of the algorithm is to run a preposterior analysis to estimate the benefit of deciding with the additional information. A final decision is made by comparing this benefit with the cost of delaying the intervention. The proposed approach is evaluated in simulation at a two-way stop road intersection for stop sign violation scenarios. The results show that the ability to postpone decisions leads to a significant reduction of false alarms and does not impair the ability of the collision avoidance system to prevent accidents.",

We use a dynamic Bayesian network to perform inference and compute a posterior distribution over the current object pose. Depending on whether a robot or a human manipulates the object, we employ a process model with or without knowledge of control inputs. Observations are obtained from a range camera. As opposed to previous object tracking methods, we explicitly model self-occlusions and occlusions from the environment, e.g, the human or robotic hand. This leads to a strongly non-linear observation model and additional dependencies in the Bayesian network. We employ a Rao-Blackwellised particle filter to compute an estimate of the object pose at every time step. In a set of experiments, we demonstrate the ability of our method to accurately and robustly track the object pose in real-time while it is being manipulated by a human or a robot.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Communication blackouts and latency are significant bottlenecks for planetary surface exploration; rovers cannot typically communicate during long traverses, so human operators cannot respond to unanticipated science targets discovered along the route. Targeted data collection by point spectrometers or high-resolution imagery requires precise aim, so it typically happens under human supervision during the start of each command cycle, directed at known targets in the local field of view. Spacecraft can overcome this limitation using onboard science data analysis to perform autonomous instrument targeting. Two critical target selection capabilities are the ability to target priority features of a known geologic class, and the ability to target anomalous surfaces that are unlike anything seen before. This work addresses both challenges using probabilistic surface classification in traverse images. We first describe a method for targeting known classes in the presence of high measurement cost that is typical for power- and time-constrained rover operations. We demonstrate a Bayesian approach that abstains from uncertain classifications to significantly improve the precision of geologic surface classifications. Our results show a significant increase in classification performance, including a seven-fold decrease in misclassification rate for our random forest classifier. We then take advantage of these classifications and learned scene context in order to train a semi-supervised novelty detector. Operators can train the novelty detection to ignore known content from previous scenes, a critical requirement for multi-day rover operations. By making use of prior scene knowledge we find nearly double the number of abnormal features detected over comparable algorithms. We evaluate both of these techniques on a set of images acquired during field expeditions in the Mojave Desert.",

        "abstract": "Continuum manipulators, inspired by invertebrate structures in nature, such as octopus arms and elephant trunks, do not contain rigid links, can deform, and are passively compliant, which make them particularly flexible for manipulation in cluttered space. A key open issue here is how to make such a manipulator autonomously grasp an object in cluttered space, especially if the object cannot be completely seen or known before being grasped. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing an approach that enables a multi-section continuum manipulator to probe an object with its tip while gradually form a whole-arm, force-closure grasp by following closely the contour of the probed object. This real-time approach is both effective and efficient for grasping an object in a cluttered space, as evident from the test examples.",

In a teleoperated rehabilitation system, communication delays introduce phase shift which may result in the task inversion phenomenon. To overcome the task inversion, a new type of projection-based force reflection algorithm is proposed which is suitable for assistive/resistive therapy in the presence of irregular communication delays. Additionally, algorithms for augmented therapy are introduced which combine the projection-based force reflection with a delay-free local virtual therapist. A small-gain design is developed which guarantees stability of the proposed schemes for both assistive and resistive modes of the therapy. Simulations and experimental results are presented which confirm the improvement achieved by the proposed methods.",

Based on first principles models, a launch condition for the pole is derived and used to design an optimal trajectory to throw the pole towards a second quadrocopter. An optimal catching instant is derived and the corresponding position is predicted by simulating the current position and velocity estimates forward in time. An algorithm is introduced that generates a trajectory for moving the catching vehicle to the predicted catching point in real time. By evaluating the pole state after the impact, an adaptation strategy adapts the catch maneuver such that the pole rotates into the upright equilibrium by itself. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the system.",

This paper includes an evaluation with respect to reconstruction accuracy, segmentation precision, execution time and compression ratio of everyday indoor scenes. Our surface reconstruction algorithm outperforms comparable approaches with respect to execution time and accuracy. More importantly, the new technique handles curved shapes accurately and enables complex tasks like 3D mapping for mobile robots in an unknown environment.",

        "abstract": "Visual odometry (VO) is a highly efficient and powerful 6D motion estimation technique; state-of-the-art bundle adjustment algorithms now optimize over several frames of temporally tracked, appearance-based features in real time. It is well known that the temporal feature correspondence process is highly prone to mismatches. The standard technique used for outlier rejection in this process is random sample consensus (RANSAC), which is an iterative and non-deterministic process used to find the parameters of a mathematical model that best describe a likely set of inliers. The traditional model used for RANSAC in the visual odometry pipeline is a rigid transformation between two camera poses; this model has long assumed the use of an imaging sensor with a global shutter. In order to use imaging sensors that do not operate with a global shutter, it is proposed that the RANSAC algorithm be modified to use a constant-camera-velocity model. Specifically, this paper investigates the use of a two-axis scanning lidar in the visual-odometry pipeline. Images are formed using lidar intensity data, and due to the scanning-while-moving nature of the lidar, the behaviour of the sensor resembles that of a slow rolling-shutter camera. We formulate a Motion-Compensated RANSAC algorithm that uses a constant-velocity model and the individual timestamp of each extracted feature. The algorithm is validated using 6880 lidar frames with a resolution of 480 \u00d7 360, captured at 2 Hz, over a 1.1 km traversal. Our results show that the new algorithm results in far more inlying feature tracks for rolling-shutter-type images and ultimately higher-accuracy VO results.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "For purposes of real-time 3D sensing, it is important to be able to quickly register together incoming point cloud data. In this paper, we devise a method to quickly and robustly decompose large point clouds into a relatively small number of meaningful surface patches from which we register new data points. The surface patch representation sidesteps the costly problem of matching points to points since incoming data only need to be compared with the patches. The chosen parametrization of the patches (as Gaussians) leads to a smooth data likelihood function with a well-defined gradient. This representation thus forms the basis for a robust and efficient registration algorithm using a parallelized gradient descent implemented on a GPU using CUDA. We use a modified Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) formulation solved by Expectation Maximization (EM) to segment the point cloud and an annealing gradient descent method to find the 6-DOF rigid transformation between the incoming point cloud and the segmented set of surface patches. We test our algorithm, Robust EM Segmentation (REM-Seg), against other GPU-accelerated registration algorithms on simulated and real data and show that our method scales well to large numbers of points, has a wide range of convergence, and is suitably accurate for 3D registration.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a cognitive map building and navigation system using an RGB-D sensor for mobile robots. A brain-inspired simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM) system, that requires raw odometry data and RGB-D information, is used to construct a spatial cognitive map of an office environment. The cognitive map contains a set of spatial coordinates that the robot has traveled. A global path is extracted from the built cognitive map and subsequently used by a local planner to instruct the robot to navigate. The global path is a subset of the path that builds up the cognitive map. This is different from other path planning mechanisms that construct a path based on a ground-truth map. Experiment results show that the employment of the RGB-D sensor significantly improves the mapping results.",

        "abstract": "We present a 3D edge detection approach for RGB-D point clouds and its application in point cloud registration. Our approach detects several types of edges, and makes use of both 3D shape information and photometric texture information. Edges are categorized as occluding edges, occluded edges, boundary edges, high-curvature edges, and RGB edges. We exploit the organized structure of the RGB-D image to efficiently detect edges, enabling near real-time performance. We present two applications of these edge features: edge-based pair-wise registration and a pose-graph SLAM approach based on this registration, which we compare to state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of edge detection and edge-based registration both quantitatively and qualitatively.",

Our particle filter is massively parallelized in a modern GPU so that it exhibits real-time performance even with several thousand particles. Given an a priori 3D mesh model, the proposed approach renders the object model onto texture buffers in the GPU, and the rendered results are directly used by our parallelized likelihood evaluation. Both photometric (colors) and geometric (3D points and surface normals) features are employed to determine the likelihood of each particle with respect to a given RGB-D scene. Our approach is compared with a tracker in the PCL both quantitatively and qualitatively in synthetic and real RGB-D sequences, respectively.",

Sensors such as the Microsoft Kinect and time of flight cameras provide 3D colored point-clouds in real time can play a crucial role in Robot Vision. However these sensors suffer from precision deficiencies, and often the density of the point-clouds they provide is insufficient. In this paper, we present a multi-camera system for correction and enhancement of the data acquired from an RGB-D sensor. Our system consists of two sensors, the RGB-D sensor (main sensor) and a regular RGB camera (auxiliary sensor). We perform the correction and the enhancement of the data acquired from the RGB-D sensor by placing the auxiliary sensor in a close proximity to the target object and taking advantage of the established epipolar geometry. We have managed to reduce the relative error of the raw point-cloud from a Microsoft Kinect RGB-D sensor by 74.5 % and increase its density up to 2.5 times.",

Randomized planning methods are first proposed in order to generate contact state transitions, which help not only to reduce the amount of calculation required, but also to handle a hybrid system composed of a continuous system and a discrete system, which has a large search space and complicated constraints. Second, a novel control strategy, which can switch manipulation modes among quasi-static, dynamic, and caging manipulation depending on the situation, is proposed. This strategy not only can cope with changes in the mechanics of the system caused by contact state transitions, but also can increase the manipulation feasibility and reliability. The validity of the proposed methods is verified through simulations and experiments.",

Moreover, most robot programs developed today are robot hardware and software specific, and therefore little reusable without modifications. This paper realizes easier robot (re-)programming, by software framework independent models that can be executed using different hard- and software platforms. First, the paper focuses on the formalization of the tasks to be fulfilled by a robot, more specifically constraint-based programming tasks using a Domain Specific Language (DSL). Second, it gives a reference implementation in Lua [1]. The presented DSL makes it easy to develop applications, yet is powerful to execute. It enables automatic model verification and code generation for different hard- and software platforms, diminishing code debugging efforts. Experimental validation shows the ease of creating an application and adapting it, the reduction of the amount of hand-written code, and the debugging aid offered through meaningful errors returned by model verification.",

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional, physics-based simulators are important to the field of self-reconfigurable robotics because they allow researchers to approximate the physical interactions and autonomous behaviors of large numbers of modules in a low-cost, safe, and highly-controlled manner. This paper presents a novel, high-performance, general-purpose simulator for autonomous, self-reconfigurable robots called ReMod3D (RM3D) that overcomes the speed and scalability limitations of existing self-reconfigurable simulators while, at the same time, allowing for realistic module structures, complex environments, and high physical simulation fidelity. While most existing self-reconfigurable simulators view modules as actuated physical bodies with programmable controllers, RM3D views them as embodied agents, defined not only by their physical bodies (links, joints, docks, sensors, actuators) but also by their minds (actions, percepts, behaviors, world models) and the noise inherent in the interaction between sensors, actuators, and the environment. RM3D also simulates inter-module dock connection breakage, something novel for self-reconfigurable robot simulators. Additionally, we present experimental evidence showing that this novel architecture makes RM3D well-suited to locomotion, manipulation, reconfiguration, and embodied intelligence research.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports on the use of planar patches as features in a real-time simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system to model smooth surfaces as piecewise-planar. This approach works well for using observed point clouds to correct odometry error, even when the point cloud is sparse. Such sparse point clouds are easily derived by Doppler velocity log sensors for underwater navigation. Each planar patch contained in this point cloud can be constrained in a factor-graph-based approach to SLAM so that neighboring patches are sufficiently coplanar so as to constrain the robot trajectory, but not so much so that the curvature of the surface is lost in the representation. To validate our approach, we simulated a virtual 6-degree of freedom robot performing a spiral-like survey of a sphere, and provide real-world experimental results for an autonomous underwater vehicle used for automated ship hull inspection. We demonstrate that using the sparse 3D point cloud greatly improves the self-consistency of the map. Furthermore, the use of our piecewise-planar framework provides an additional constraint to multi-session underwater SLAM, improving performance over monocular camera measurements alone.",

        "abstract": "Without a precise and up-to-date model of its environment a humanoid robot cannot move safely or act usefully. Ideally, the robot should create a dense 3D environment model in real-time, all the time, and respect obstacle information from it in every move it makes as well as obtain the information it needs for fine manipulation with its fingers from the same map. We propose to use a multi-scale truncated signed distance function (TSDF) map consisting of concentric, nested cubes with exponentially decreasing resolution for this purpose. We show how to extend the KinectFusion real-time SLAM algorithm to the multi-scale case as well as how to compute a multi-scale Euclidean distance transform (EDT) thereby establishing the link to optimization-based planning. We overcome the inability of KinectFusion's localization to handle scenes without enough constraining geometry by switching to mapping-with-known-poses based on forward kinematics. The latter is always available and we know when it is precise. The resulting map has the desired properties: It is computed in real-time (7.5 ms per depth frame for a (8 m)3 multi-scale TSDF volume), covers the entire laboratory, does not depend on scene properties (geometry, texture, etc.) and is precise enough to facilitate grasp planning for fine manipulation tasks \u2014 all in a single map.",

In the implementation of the mosaicing algorithm, feature point extraction was accelerated by implementing a parallel processing circuit module for Harris corner detection in the FPGA on the high-speed vision platform. Feature point correspondence matching can be executed for hundreds of selected feature points in the current frame by searching those in the previous frame in their neighbor ranges, assuming that frame-to-frame image displacement becomes considerably smaller in HFR vision. The system we developed can mosaic 512\u00d7512 images at 500 fps as a single synthesized image in real time by stitching the images based on their estimated frame-to-frame changes in displacement and orientation. The results of an experiment conducted, in which an outdoor scene was captured using a hand-held camera-head that was quickly moved by hand, verify the performance of our system.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates Sound Source Localization (SSL) for a robot in a real world. Previously, we focused on one-dimensional SSL for azimuth and assumed that target sources are distributed close to a horizontal plane. Without this assumption, the SSL performance is drastically degraded. Thus, three-dimensional SSL is essential to improve the localization for sound sources distributed in a three-dimensional space. Compared to one-dimensional SSL, three-dimensional SSL mainly has the following problems: 1) a massive number of Transfer Function (TF) measurements for microphone array calibration are required for three dimensions to maintain the spatial resolution of SSL sufficiently-high, 2) the computational cost for searching for sound sources drastically increases in high-dimensional spaces. For the first issue, we extend the previously-proposed one-dimensional TF interpolation method, integrating time-domain-based and frequency-domain-based interpolation, to three dimensions. The interpolation achieves three-dimensional super-resolution SSL and reduction of the number of TF measurements while maintaining the spatial resolution of SSL. For the second issue, we propose optimal hierarchical SSL, which reduces computational cost for searching for sound sources by introducing a hierarchical search algorithm instead of using greedy search in localization. We previously proposed the concept of the algorithm. This paper additionally discusses theoretical optimality in hierarchization to minimize the total computational cost of SSL. The method determines the number of hierarchies and the resolution of each hierarchy depending on desired spatial resolution. These techniques are integrated into an SSL system using a robot. The experimental result showed: 1) the proposed interpolation method achieved super-resolution SSL working better than that with pre-measured TFs, 2) the optimal hierarchical SSL drastically reduced computational cost by approximately 97%.

        "abstract": "This study presents one of the enabling technologies for teleoperated bevel-tip needle steering under real-time MRI guidance i.e. capability of tracking the needle with higher accuracy and bandwidth than real-time MRI. Three fibers, each with three Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBG) were embedded into a 0.6 mm inner stylet of a 20G MRI-compatible biopsy needle. The axial force caused by the bevel-tip was considered in the analysis using beam-column theory. Since the insertion depth is varying, the minimum number of sensors and their optimal locations in the fibers were determined such that the tip position error estimation is below 0.5 mm for all insertion depths. A practical and accurate calibration method for the apparatus is presented. The instrumented needle was fabricated to fit in the needle driver unit of a MRI-compatible needle steering robot. The tracking apparatus was calibrated, including compensation for temperature changes in tissue during insertion. Experimental results showed needle tip tracking error below 0.5 mm at different insertion depths. Real-time 3D shape of the needle was visualized in 3D Slicer yielding navigation of the needle in real-time.",

The method is based on color-space segmentation to identify the wheel contour and consequently the depth of the sinkage. In addition, our approach also provides a dynamic sinkage analysis which potentially allows for the identification of non-geometric hazards. The robustness of the algorithm has been validated for poor lighting, blurring, and background noise.

In order to tackle the dynamical complexity of the human body, the COM-ZMP (the center of mass and the zero-moment point) model, which is widely used for designing the whole-body controller of humanoid robots, and a piecewise-linear controller is applied. In the previous experiment, the authors proposed a method to collect a sufficient number of loci of COM in a phase space for the identification of a controller, and showed that the human's standing behavior qualitatively has a similar property with the COM-ZMP model. It was also found, however, that the collected loci had large variability due to the uncertainty of convergence point and were partially inconsistent with the model, so that it was still difficult to identify the controller. Then, the authors reassessed the model and measurement protocol, and conducted the second experiment in order to improve the reliability of the measurement by visually presenting the referential point to subjects and by redesigning the protocol. As the result, more reliable loci to be processed of identification were obtained. It was also found that the effect of variation of the COM height due to the limitation of leg length, which was thought to be another source of the inconsistency, certainly existed but was not critical to model the human behavior.",

        "abstract": "Computer vision as an entire field has a wide and diverse range of applications. The specific application for this project was in the realm of dance, notably ballet and choreography. This project was proof-of-concept for a choreography assistance tool used to recognize and record dance movements demonstrated by a choreographer. Keeping the commercial arena in mind, the Kinect from Microsoft was chosen as the imaging hardware, and a pilot set chosen to verify recognition feasibility. Before implementing a classifier, all training and test data was transformed to a more applicable representation scheme to only pass the important aspects to the classifier to distinguish moves for the pilot set. In addition, several classification algorithms using the Nearest Neighbor (NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) methods were tested and compared from a single dictionary as well as on several different subjects. The results were promising given the framework of the project, and several new expansions of this work are proposed.",

The proposed ADL recognition system takes RGBD sensor (Microsoft Kinect) as the input device. In ADL recognition, the object interacted with human is a sort of important context as well as human action. To better understand the activity, we model the interacted object and the human action together. As far as we known, many related works failed to take into account the relation between the context information and human action features, instead, most of them only consider the human action features, causing ambiguity in classifying the activities with similar human actions. In this paper, the context information and human action features are taken into consideration, concurrently, so that the performance of recognition can be greatly improved from previous works as has been demonstrated in our experimental results.",

Specifically, we treat a cooperative localization setup and consider the problem of recursively arriving at a unimodal state estimate with sufficiently low covariance such that covariance based filters can be used to estimate an agent's state subsequently. The initialization of the position of an anchor node will be a special case of this. A number of simplifications/assumptions are made such that the estimation problem can be seen as that of estimating the initial agent state given a deterministic surrounding and dead reckoning. This problem is solved by means of a particle filter and it is described how continual states and covariance estimates are derived from the solution. Finally, simulations are used to illustrate the characteristics of the method and experimental data are briefly presented.",

        "abstract": "System monitoring can help to detect abnormalities and avoid failures. Crafting monitors for today's robotic systems, however, can be very difficult due to the systems' inherent complexity. In this work we address this challenge through an approach that automatically infers system invariants and synthesizes those invariants into monitors. The approach is novel in that it derives invariants by observing the messages passed between system nodes and the invariants types are tailored to match the spatial, temporal, and operational attributes of robotic systems. Further, the generated monitor can be seamlessly integrated into systems built on top of publish-subscribe architectures. An application of the technique on a system consisting of a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) landing on a moving platform shows that it can significantly reduce the number of crashes in unexpected landing scenarios.",

The goal is to optimally exploit the capabilities of the hardware in terms of maximum jump height, jump distance, and energy efficiency of periodic hopping. These challenges are tackled with the reinforcement learning method Policy Improvement with Path Integrals (PI2) in a model-free approach to learn parameterized motor velocity trajectories as well as highlevel control parameters. The combination of simulation and hardware-based optimization allows to efficiently obtain optimal control policies in an up to 10-dimensional parameter space. The robotic leg learns to temporarily store energy in the elastic elements of the joints in order to improve the jump height and distance. In addition, we present a method to learn time-independent control policies and apply it to improve the energetic efficiency of periodic hopping.",

The scene graph relies on semantic pose and twist representation, making it invariant to the actual coordinate representation at hand. This makes the scene graph more general and interoperable than most scene graphs currently available. The presented scene graph takes into account constraints imposed by particular coordinate representations, allows for constant poses, answers semantic pose and twist queries, and provides built-in semantic consistency checks. Since the scene graph also keeps track of the twist, it allows native twist calculations, as opposed to deriving the velocities from the poses in the graph.

However, very few of them have direct applicability in complex robotics systems without assuming prior knowledge about the task due to two facts. On one hand, they scale badly to continues and high dimensional problems. On the other hand, they require too many real learning episodes. In this sense, this paper provides a detailed description of an original approach capable of learning from scratch suboptimal solutions and of providing closed-loop motor control policies in the proximity of such solutions. The developed architecture manages the solution in two consecutive phases. The first phase provides an initial open-loop solution state-action trajectory by mixing kinodynamic planning with model learning. In the second phase, the initial state trajectory solution is first smoothed and then, a closed-loop controller with active learning capabilities is learned in its proximity. We will demonstrate the efficiency of this two phases approach in the Cart-Pole Swing-Up Task problem.",

Vision-based road recognition in outdoor environments remains a significant challenge. Our approach exploits digital street maps, the robot position, and prior knowledge of the environment. We segment an input image into superpixels, which are grouped into various object classes such as roadway, sidewalk, curb, and wall. We formulate the classification problem as an energy minimization problem and employ graph cuts to estimate the optimal object classes in the image. Although prior information assists recognition, erroneous information can lead to false recognition. Therefore, we incorporate localization into our recognition method to correct errors in robot position. The effectiveness of our method was verified through experiments using real-world urban datasets.",

        "abstract": "In-pipe robots are important for inspection of pipe network that form vital infrastructure of modern society. Nevertheless, most in-pipe robots developed so far are targeted at working inside gas pipes and not suitable for liquid pipes. This paper presents a new approach for designing in-pipe robot to work inside a liquid environment in the presence of high drag forces. Three major subsystems - propulsion, braking, and turning - are described in detail with new concepts and mechanisms that differ from conventional in-pipe robots. Prototypes of each subsystem are designed, built and tested for validation. Resulting is a robot design that navigates efficiently inside liquid pipe network and can be used for practical inspection purposes.",

        "abstract": "An affordance is a relation between an object, an action, and the effect of that action in a given environmental context. One key benefit of the concept of affordance is that it provides information about the consequence of an action which can be stored and reused in a range of tasks that a robot needs to learn and perform. In this paper, we address the challenge of the on-line learning and use of affordances simultaneously while performing goal-directed tasks. This requires efficient online performance to ensure the robot is able to achieve its goal fast. By providing conceptual knowledge of action possibilities and desired effects, we show that a humanoid robot NAO can learn and use affordances in two different task settings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by integrating affordances into an Extended Classifier System for learning general rules in a reinforcement learning framework. Our experimental results show significant speedups in learning how a robot solves a given task.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses the problem of generating efficient coverage paths for a mobile robot in an adversarial environment, where threats exist that might stop the robot. First, we formally define the problem of adversarial coverage, and present optimization criteria used for evaluation of coverage algorithms in adversarial environments. We then present a coverage area planning algorithm based on a map of the probable threats. The algorithm tries to minimize the total risk involved in covering the target area while taking into account coverage time constrains. The algorithm is based on incrementally extending the coverage path to the nearest safe cells while allowing the robot to repeat its steps. By allowing the robot to visit each cell in the target area more than once, the accumulated risk can be reduced at the expense of extending the coverage time. We show the effectiveness of this algorithm in extensive experiments.",

Single strokes of the calligraphy characters are represented in a database and initialized with a scanned reference image and a manually chosen initial drawing spline. A learning procedure uses visual feedback to analyze each new iteration of the drawn stroke and updates the drawing spline such that every subsequent drawn stroke becomes more similar to the reference image. The learning procedure can be performed either in simulation, using a simple brush model to create simulated images of the strokes, or with a real robot arm equipped with a calligraphy brush and a camera that captures images of the drawn strokes. Results from both simulations and experiments with the robot arm are presented.",

        "abstract": "For many robot operations force control is needed, but force sensors may be expensive and add mass to the system. An alternative is to use the motor torques, though friction causes large disturbances. The Coulomb friction can be quite well known when a joint is moving, but has much larger uncertainties for velocities close to zero. This paper presents a method for force estimation that accounts for the velocity-dependent uncertainty of the Coulomb friction and combines data from several joints to produce accurate estimates. The estimate is calculated by solving a convex optimization problem in real time. The proposed method was experimentally evaluated on a force-controlled dual-arm assembly operation and validated with data from a force sensor. The estimates were shown to improve with the number of joints used, and the method can even exploit data from an arm that is controlled not to move.",

        "abstract": "We present a new image-based visual servoing scheme for tracking moving targets. This is achieved with a twofold approach. First, we devise a straightforward adaptation of a previously proposed depth observer to account for the fact that the target is not stationary. Second, we estimate the disturbance on the visual feature dynamics due to the target motion, and we add a related compensation term to the visual controller. In particular, the target velocity components parallel to the image plane are reconstructed using a disturbance observer, whereas the orthogonal component is retrieved from the measurement of the Focus Of Expansion. Comparative experiments show that the proposed method can improve over classical visual servoing schemes by 50% or more.",

        "abstract": "Precise navigation is a key capability of autonomous mobile robots and required for many tasks including transportation or docking. To guarantee a robust and accurate localization and navigation performance, many practical approaches rely on observations of artificial landmarks. This raises the question of where to place the landmarks along the desired trajectory of the robot. In this paper, we present a novel approach to landmark selection, which aims at selecting the minimal set of landmarks that bounds the uncertainty about the deviation of the robot from its desired trajectory. At the same time the selected landmark sets are robust against the fact that a certain number of landmarks can be obscured from view during operation. Our algorithm is highly efficient due to a linearization of the whole navigation cycle and employs submodular optimization, for which strong formal bounds on the approximation quality are known. In extensive experiments, also carried out with a real robot, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms several other methods and that it enables robust autonomous robot navigation in practice.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a study of the control problem of a laser beam illuminating and focusing a microobject subjected to dynamic disturbances using light intensity for feedback only. The main idea is to guide and track the beam with a hybrid micro/nanomanipulator which is driven by a control signal generated by processing the beam intensity sensed by a four-quadrant photodiode. Since the pointing location of the beam depends on real-time control issues related to temperature variation, vibrations, output intensity control, and collimation of the light output, the 2D beam location to the photodiode sensor measurement output is estimated in realtime. We use the Kalman filter (KF) algorithm for estimating the state of the linear system necessary for implementing the proposed track-following control approach. To do so a robust master/slave control strategy for micro/nano dual-stage manipulators is presented based on sensitivity function decoupling design methodology. The decoupled feedback controller is synthesized and implemented in a 6 dof micro/nanomanipulator capable of nanometer resolution through several hundreds micrometer range. A case study relevant to tracking a laser-beam for imaging purposes is presented.",

This paper implements a path following controller, based on transverse feedback linearization (TFL), which guarantees invariance of the path to be followed. The coordinate and feedback transformation employed allows one to easily design control laws to generate arbitrary desired motions on the path for the closed-loop system. The approach is applied to an uncertain and simplified model of a robot manipulator for which none of the dynamic parameters are measured. The controller is made robust to modelling uncertainties using Lyapunov redesign. The robustified controller is tested on a 4-degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) manipulator with a combination of revolute and linear actuated links. The experimental results show a substantial improvement when using the robust controller for path following versus standard state feedback.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we model the robust loop-closure pose-graph SLAM problem as a Bayesian network and show that it can be solved with the Classification Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. In particular, we express our robust pose-graph SLAM as a Bayesian network where the robot poses and constraints are latent and observed variables. An additional set of latent variables is introduced as weights for the loop-constraints. We show that the weights can be chosen as the Cauchy function, which are iteratively computed from the errors between the predicted robot poses and observed loop-closure constraints in the Expectation step, and used to weigh the cost functions from the pose-graph loop-closure constraints in the Maximization step. As a result, outlier loop-closure constraints are assigned low weights and exert less influences in the pose-graph optimization within the EM iterations. To prevent the EM algorithm from getting stuck at local minima, we perform the EM algorithm multiple times where the loop constraints with very low weights are removed after each EM process. This is repeated until there are no more changes to the weights. We show proofs of the conceptual similarity between our EM algorithm and the M-Estimator. Specifically, we show that the weight function in our EM algorithm is equivalent to the robust residual function in the M-Estimator. We verify our proposed algorithm with experimental results from multiple simulated and real-world datasets, and comparisons with other existing works.",

        "abstract": "Achieving a robust, accurately scaled pose estimate in long-range stereo presents significant challenges. For large scene depths, triangulation from a single stereo pair is inadequate and noisy. Additionally, vibration and flexible rigs in airborne applications mean accurate calibrations are often compromised. This paper presents a technique for accurately initializing a long-range stereo VO algorithm at large scene depth, with accurate scale, without explicitly computing structure from rigidly fixed camera pairs. By performing a monocular pose estimate over a window of frames from a single camera, followed by adding the secondary camera frames in a modified bundle adjustment, an accurate, metrically scaled pose estimate can be found. To achieve this the scale of the stereo pair is included in the optimization as an additional parameter. Results are presented both on simulated and field gathered data from a fixed-wing UAV flying at significant altitude, where the epipolar geometry is inaccurate due to structural deformation and triangulation from a single pair is insufficient. Comparisons are made with more conventional VO techniques where the scale is not explicitly optimized, and demonstrated over repeated trials to indicate robustness.",

Due to quadratic cost functions when optimizing SLAM via nonlinear least square methods, a single such outlier can cause severe map distortions. Following in the footsteps of recent improvements in the robustness of SLAM optimization process, this work presents a framework for improving sensor noise characterizations by combining a machine learning approach with max-mixture error models. By using max-mixtures, the sensor's noise distribution can be modeled to a desired accuracy, with robustness to outliers. We apply the framework to the task of accurately modeling the uncertainties of consumer-grade GPS sensors. Our method estimates the observation covariances using only weighted feature vectors and a single max operator, learning parameters off-line for efficient on-line calculation.",

        "abstract": "This work is concerned with the matching of straight lines between two stereo image pairs by reprojection. While we will focus on visual odometry in the realm of simultaneous mapping and localization, the techniques are also relevant to monocular and stereo 3D object detection and tracking. Our first contribution is an adaptation of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to the domain of lines. We argue that a naive \u201cIterative Closest Line\u201d derivation cannot deliver similar performance. In contrast, our novel Iterative Closest Multiple Lines (ICML) algorithm allows efficient line matching while even reducing the amount of local minima during iterative optimization with its consideration of several weighted matches. The second contribution is a fast and robust hypothesize-and-test algorithm which can act as a fallback for challenging frame pairs where pure gradient-based optimization fails. In several differently textured scenes, we demonstrate robust performance, even in very sparse cases where proven feature point based methods fail. In comparison to edge-point ICP, we see speed improvements of more than an order of a magnitude and reduced susceptibility for local minima.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores the use of mechanical redundancy to enhance robustness to leg failures in miniature ambulatory robots. Graceful degradation, rather than immediate catastrophic failure, is exhibited experimentally in 10\u201320 leg centipede-inspired millirobots as legs are removed without altering the gait, using speed and radius of curvature as performance metrics. Static stability retention is examined as a function of the nominal number of legs, and for cases where static stability is lost, two gait options are tested. The effect of location of missing legs on performance is also described.",

By using the Rolling SLIP (R-SLIP) model as the \u201ctemplate\u201d of the robot, together with the investigation of the stability properties of the R-SLIP model, the robot implemented with the selected trajectory based on the R-SLIP motion can immediately excite its dynamic running behavior (i.e., composed of stance and flight phases) without necessity of extra tuning or optimization effort. In addition, a feedback control strategy is proposed to regulate the robot's motion when the robot's operating region is not located at the stable area of the R-SLIP model (i.e., no stable fixed point). The controller includes three portions: a body velocity estimator, a database containing a wide range of pre-computed R-SLIP trajectories, and a control law which regulates the robot motion to the desired R-SLIP profile. The proposed methodology of robot trajectory generation and strategy of running regulation are experimentally evaluated.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Force-position control through one or multiple robots, or fingers, typically assumes a rigid endpoint without rolling nor slipping. However, there are some interesting tasks where rolling is involved, such as turning a knob (object is pivoting at a fixed rotational axis) or rolling a wheel (object rotational axis is moving). In such a case, rigid endpoint force control becomes very difficult if not impossible, even for us humans. This stems from two facts, firstly, infinitesimally small rigid point does not yield a tangent force, therefore it is very difficult to control it indirectly; and secondly, the pair robot-object stands for a highly non-linear constrained underactuated dynamical systems. In this paper, we aim at exploring rolling of a rigid dynamic circular object with hemispherical deformable fingertip, then with area, not point, contact. The dynamic model and a control scheme are presented inspired in previous works, but regulation of normal and tangential forces, as well as position and orientation of the object are synthesized. In particular, tangential force control proves instrumental to regulate posture, and displacement of the object with a simple transpose Jacobian Cartesian PDF+g control. Regulation of rolling angle and displacement with stable normal and tangential forces are obtained without force sensing, neither any model of the deformation nor any dynamic parameter of the object. To entertain these control objectives, a redundant configuration is required so as to yield local regulation, based on the stability-in-the-manifold criteria, whose dimension is greater than the operational space. Illustrative simulations are discussed that provide insight into the closed-loop numerical performance, and finally, remarks on the structure and potential applications are addressed.",

Equipped with novel grippers which grip and rub on clothes, Rubbot is able to climb on flexible clothes and control how much fabric to grasp by feedback from infrared sensor. Rubbot also has a frame which has three passive folders which adjust the climbing posture of Rubbot. This not only makes Rubbot quite functional with clothes of different thicknesses and curved surfaces, but also makes Rubbot's motion more flexible. A theory of the deformation of cloth is then presented based on an analysis of creases created while Rubbot is climbing, this leads to a more reliable method to climb flexible surfaces. Finally experiments have verified that Rubbot is effective on flexible surfaces, as it can climb on 95% of the surfaces human clothes and still perform well on non-rigidly backed cloth.",

In this work we propose a simple on-line method for tracking the pose of a depth camera in six degrees of freedom and simultaneously maintaining an updated 3D map, represented as a truncated signed distance function. The distance function representation implicitly encodes surfaces in 3D-space and is used directly to define a cost function for accurate registration of new data. The proposed algorithm is highly parallel and achieves good accuracy compared to state of the art methods. It is suitable for reconstructing single household items, workspace environments and small rooms at near real-time rates, making it practical for use on modern CPU hardware.",

Traditional surgical manipulators are usually based on metallic steerable needles, tendon driven mechanisms or articulated motorized links. In this work the main idea is to combine flexible fluidic actuators enabling omnidirectional bending and elongation capability and the granular jamming phenomenon to implement a selective stiffness changing. The proposed manipulator is based on a series of identical modules, each one consisting of a silicone tube with pneumatic chambers for allowing 3D motion and one central channel for the implementation of the granular jamming phenomenon for stiffening. The silicone is covered by a novel bellows-shaped braided structure maximizing the bending still limiting lateral expansion. In this paper one single module is tested in terms of bending range, elongation capability, generated forces and stiffness changing.",

This paper addresses aspects of safe navigation in the range of wall-climbing robots using negative pressure adhesion in combination with a drive system. In this context aspects of the developed robot control architecture will be presented and common hazards for this type of robots are examined. Based on this a risk prediction function is trained via methods of evolutionary algorithms using internal data generated inside of the behavior-based robot control network. Although there will always be a residual risk of a robot dropoff it is shown that the risk could be lowered tremendously by the developed analysis methods and counteractive measures.",

        "abstract": "Magnetically driven wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) represents one of the last achievements in the research of minimally invasive tools for gastrointestinal tract (GI) diagnosis. Recently, capsule localization methodologies have been employed to enable system autonomy maintaining a magnetic link with the device and managing interaction forces with GI tissues. To achieve these objectives, the locomotion platforms exploit automatic motion in some degrees of freedom and unsupervised contact with the external patient abdomen can occur. In this paper safety issues are faced; in particular a safety system, able to monitor pressure with patient abdomen, has been designed, characterized, and integrated with a magnetically driven WCE locomotion platform. New technologies, such as smart textiles, have been employed as sensible element. The proposed system showed promising results in controlling the pressure exerted on the abdomen respecting safety limits and increasing the efficiency and range of locomotion.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for finding the largest, connected, smooth surface in noisy depth images. The formulation of the fitting in a Sample Consensus approach allows the use of RANSAC (or any other similar estimator), and makes the method tolerant to low percentage of inliers in the input. Therefore it can be used to simultaneously segment and model the surface of interest. This is important in applications like analyzing physical properties of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) structures using depth cameras. Employing bivariate polynomials for modeling turns out to be advantageous, allowing to capture the variations along the two principle directions on the surface. However, fitting them efficiently using RANSAC is not straightforward. We present the necessary pre- and post-processing, distance and normal direction checks, and degree optimization (lowering the order of the polynomial), and evaluate how these improve results. Finally, to improve the initial estimate provided by RANSAC and to stabilize the results, an Expectation Maximization (EM) strategy is employed to converge to the best solution. The method was tested on high-quality data and as well on real-world scenes captured by a RGB-D camera.",

The algorithm has three main features. First, it is incremental, in the sense that the procedure for finding a satisfying path at each iteration scales only with the number of new samples generated at that iteration. Second, the underlying graph is sparse, which guarantees the low complexity of the overall method. Third, it is probabilistically complete. Examples illustrating the usefulness and the performance of the method are included.",

Its goal is to maximize the probability of capturing the target within the budget. A challenging aspect of our model is that the target can cross the searcher without being captured when they take the same edge at the same time in opposite directions. We present a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) approach for finding the optimal search strategy. We also present an efficient approximate solution to the POMDP. The strategies found by this approach reveal structural properties of the efficient search strategies which we exploit to solve the problem efficiently without running the POMDP.",

The sensing model and the characteristic of the environment require the searcher and the target to be on the same site at the same time to guarantee capture. The objective is to optimize the searcher's motion, given by a sequence of actions (move right, left or remain stationary), so that the probability of capturing the target is maximized. Each action is associated with an energy cost. The searcher strategy is constrained by a total energy budget. We propose a class of randomized strategies for which we provide an analytical expression for the capture probability as a function of a single parameter. We then use this expression to find the best strategy within this class. In addition to theoretical results, the algorithms are analyzed in simulation and compared with other intuitive solutions.",

While the construction of consistent and coherent local solutions is simple, the SLAM remains a critical problem as the distance travelled by the robot increases. To circumvent this limitation, many strategies divide the environment in small regions, and formulate the SLAM problem as a combination of multiple precise submaps. In this paper, we propose a new submap-based particle filter algorithm called Segmented DP-SLAM, that combines an optimized data structure to store the maps of the particles with a probabilistic map of segments, representing hypothesis of submaps topologies.

Normally, micropumps in microfluidic systems are powered by electricity or heat generated from electric energy and the actuation is controlled by on-off switching of external inputs. Herein we report a novel autonomous flow control inside microfluidic channels powered by self-oscillating gels without external control devices. Self-oscillating gels exhibit a volume oscillation driven by the oscillatory Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction. Our approach greatly simplifies the microfluidic system construction because there is no need for the electric wiring and source. In this paper, we first demonstrate a directional fluid pumping within microfluidic channels and a directional flow rate was 0.02 \u03bcL/min utilizing self-oscillating gels. This self-actuated pump could serve as a new framework for microfluidic devices.",

        "abstract": "Recently, language education has a great demand from elementary school to adults. Robots are used as teaching assistants in Robot-Assisted Language Learning. It is very effective to use robots for language education. However, the robots may have some problems. One of the problems is to get bored when interacting with robots. This paper deals with this issue by using a method based on social cognitive theory. We discuss the role of robots based on mutual learning in language education. Next, we explain the concept of self-efficacy for evaluating the learning condition of robots. We propose a method to express self-efficacy using fuzzy control. The essence of the proposed method is to adapt to human's state. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method for long-term communication between a human and a robot.",

        "abstract": "Nature regularly uses self-folding as an efficient approach to automated fabrication. In engineered systems, however, the use of self-folding has been primarily restricted to the assembly of small structures using exotic materials and/or complex infrastructures. In this paper we present three approaches to the self-folding of structures using low-cost, rapid-prototyped shape memory laminates. These structures require minimal deployment infrastructure, and are activated by light, heat, or electricity. We compare the fabrication of a fundamental structure (a cube) using each approach, and test ways to control fold angles in each case. Finally, for each self-folding approach we present a unique structure that the approach is particularly suited to fold, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.",

        "abstract": "Human intention estimation is important for assistive lower limb exoskeleton, and the task is realized mostly by the dynamics model or the EMG model. Although the dynamics model offers better estimation, it fails when unmodeled disturbances come into the system, such as the ground reaction force. In contrast, the EMG model is non-stationary, and therefore the offline calibrated EMG model is not satisfactory for long-time operation. In this paper, we propose the self-learning scheme with the sliding mode admittance control to overcome the deficiency. In the swing phase, the dynamics model is used to estimate the intention while teaching the EMG model; in the consecutive swing phase, the taught EMG model is used alternatively. In consequence, the self-learning control scheme provides better estimations during the whole operation. In addition, the admittance interface and the sliding mode controller ensure robust performance. The control scheme is justified by the knee orthosis with the backdrivable spring torsion actuator, and the experimental results are prominent.",

Each rover can communicate with others using radio, and a wireless mesh network is configured on an asteroid's surface. Our proposed system has the following three advantages against a conventional exploration system using one or two rovers: (1) It is possible to explore a wider area of an asteroid. (2) Since the mesh network has redundant communication paths, it has more robustness against some troubles. (3) It is possible to estimate the relative distances among plural rovers by using the mesh network. This relative distance estimation is useful for asteroid analyses using sensors that rovers have. Simulation results reveal the validity and effectiveness of our proposed rover system with the wireless mesh network and the relative distance estimation method.",

We approach this challenge by folding a 0.27 mm sheet-like material into a structure. We utilize the thermal deformation of a contractive sheet sandwiched by rigid structural layers. During this \u201cbaking\u201d process, the heat applied on the entire sheet induces contraction of the contracting layer and, thus, forms an instructed bend in the sheet. To attain the targeted folding angles, the V-fold Spans method is used. The targeted angle \u03b8out can be kinematically encoded into crease geometry. The realization of this angle in the folded structure can be approximately controlled by a contraction angle \u03b8in. The process is non-reversible, is reliable, and it is relatively fast. Our method can be applied simultaneously to all the folds in multi-creased origami structures. We demonstrate the use of this method to create a light-weight mobile robot.",

        "abstract": "We propose Bayesian approaches for semantic mapping, active localization and local navigation with affordable vision sensors. We develop Bayesian model of egocentric semantic map which consists of spatial object relationships and spatial node relationships. Our topological-semantic-metric (TSM) map has characteristic that a node is one of the components of a general topological map that contains information about spatial relationships. In localization part, view dependent place recognition, reorientation and active search are used for robot localization. A robot estimates its location by Bayesian filtering which leverages spatial relationships among observed objects. Then a robot can infer the head direction to reach a goal in the semantic map. In navigation part, a robot perceives navigable space with Kinect sensor and then moves to goal location while preserving reference head direction. If obstacles are founded in front, then a robot changes the head direction to avoid them. After avoiding obstacles, a robot performs active localization and finds new head direction to goal location. Our Bayesian navigation program provides how a robot should select either an action for following line of moving direction or action for avoiding obstacles. We show that a mobile robot successfully navigates from starting position to goal node while avoiding obstacles by our proposed semantic navigation system with TSM map.",

        "abstract": "High level reasoning is becoming essential to autonomous systems such as robots. Both the information available to and the reasoning required for such autonomous systems is fundamentally incremental in nature. A stream is a flow of incrementally available information and reasoning over streams is called stream reasoning. Incremental reasoning over streaming information is necessary to support a number of important robotics functionalities such as situation awareness, execution monitoring, and decision making. This paper presents a practical framework for semantically grounded temporal stream reasoning called DyKnow. Incremental reasoning over streams is achieved through efficient progression of temporal logical formulas. The reasoning is semantically grounded through a common ontology and a specification of the semantic content of streams relative to the ontology. This allows the finding of relevant streams through semantic matching. By using semantic mappings between ontologies it is also possible to do semantic matching over multiple ontologies. The complete stream reasoning framework is integrated in the Robot Operating System (ROS) thereby extending it with a stream reasoning capability.",

In this problem, A, X, and B are homogeneous transformations with A and B acquired from sensor measurements and X being the unknown. It has been known for decades that this problem is solvable for X when a set of exactly measured A's and B's, in a priori correspondence, is given. However, in practical problems, the data streams containing the A' and B's will be asynchronous and may contain gaps (i.e., the correspondence is unknown, or does not exist, for the sensor measurements) and temporal registration is required. For the AX = XB problem, an exact solution can be found when four independent invariant quantities exist between two pairs of A's and B's. We formally define these invariants, reviewing and elaborating results from classical screw theory. We then illustrate how they can be used, with sensor data from multiple sources that contain unknown or missing correspondences, to provide a solution for X.",

        "abstract": "We study the problem of coordinating an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) for a precision agriculture application. In this application, the ground and aerial measurements are used for estimating nitrogen (N) levels on-demand across a farm. Our goal is to estimate the N map over a field and classify each point based on N deficiency levels. These estimates in turn guide fertilizer application. Applying the right amount of fertilizer at the right time can drastically reduce fertilizer usage. Towards building such a system, this paper makes the following contributions: First, we present a method to identify points whose probability of being misclassified is above a threshold. Second, we study the problem of maximizing the number of such points visited by an UAV subject to its energy budget. The novelty of our formulation is the capability of the UGV to mule the UAV to deployment points. This allows the system to conserve the short battery life of a typical UAV. Third, we introduce a new path planning problem in which the UGV must take a measurement within a disk centered at each point visited by the UAV. The goal is to minimize the total time spent in traveling and measuring. For both problems, we present constant-factor approximation algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our system with simulations which use manually collected soil measurements from the field.",

        "abstract": "Handling objects with a single hand without dropping the object is challenging for a robot. A possible way to aid the motion planning is the prediction of the sensory results of different motions. Sequences of different movements can be performed as an offline simulation, and using the predicted sensory results, it can be evaluated whether the desired goal is achieved. In particular, the task in this paper is to roll a sphere between the fingertips of the dexterous hand of the humanoid robot TWENDY-ONE. First, a forward model for the prediction of the touch state resulting from the in-hand manipulation is developed. As it is difficult to create such a model analytically, the model is obtained through machine learning. To get real world training data, a dataglove is used to control the robot in a master-slave way. The learned model was able to accurately predict the course of the touch state while performing successful and unsuccessful in-hand manipulations. In a second step, it is shown that this simulated sequence of sensor states can be used as input for a stability assessment model. This model can accurately predict whether a grasp is stable or whether it results in dropping the object. In a final step, a more powerful grasp stability evaluator is introduced, which works for our task regardless of the sphere diameter.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Dexterous grasping of objects with uncertain pose is a hard unsolved problem in robotics. This paper solves this problem using information gain re-planning. First we show how tactile information, acquired during a failed attempt to grasp an object can be used to refine the estimate of that object's pose. Second, we show how this information can be used to replan new reach to grasp trajectories for successive grasp attempts. Finally we show how reach-to-grasp trajectories can be modified, so that they maximise the expected tactile information gain, while simultaneously delivering the hand to the grasp configuration that is most likely to succeed. Our main novel outcome is thus to enable tactile information gain planning for Dexterous, high degree of freedom (DoFs) manipulators. We achieve this using a combination of information gain planning, hierarchical probabilistic roadmap planning, and belief updating from tactile sensors for objects with non-Gaussian pose uncertainty in 6 dimensions. The method is demonstrated in trials with simulated robots. Sequential replanning is shown to achieve a greater success rate than single grasp attempts, and trajectories that maximise information gain require fewer re-planning iterations than conventional planning methods before a grasp is achieved.",

Due to the unavailability of suitable actuators, however, novel intelligent and agile robots are often restricted in their performances and development. The limited output torque range and low energy efficiency of current robotic actuators are the main bottlenecks. We have developed a SPEA with intermittent mechanism that addresses these problems. The SPEA is a novel compliant actuator concept that enables variable recruitment of parallel elastic elements and adaptive load cancellation. This paper describes how a SPEA lowers the motor torque and increases the energy efficiency. Experiments on the first proof of concept set-up endorse the practicability of the SPEA concept and the modeled trend of a lowered motor torque and increased energy efficiency. We expect that features of the biologically inspired SPEA with intermittent mechanism will prove exceedingly useful for robotics applications in the future.",

        "abstract": "A recent method to obtain correct robot controllers is to automatically synthesize them from high-level robot missions that are specified in temporal logic. In this context, we aim for controllers that are optimal, i.e., do not let the robot take unnecessarily costly paths to reach its goals. Previous work on obtaining optimal synthesized robot controllers either ignored interactions with the environment, or assumed a cooperative environment. In this paper, we solve the problem of obtaining optimal robot controllers for adversarial environments. Our main observation is that the quality of a path to a goal has two dimensions: (1) the number of phases in which the robot waits for the environment to perform some actions and (2) the cost of the robot's actions to reach the goal. Our synthesis algorithm can take any prioritization over the possible cost combinations into account, and computes the optimal strategy in a symbolic manner, despite the fact that the action costs can be non-integer. We show the scalability of the new algorithm by example of a delivery problem.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In many home and service applications, an emerging class of articulated robots such as the Raven and Baxter trade off precision in actuation and sensing to reduce costs and to reduce the potential for injury to humans in their workspaces. For planning and control of such robots, planning in belief ssigma hullpace, i.e., modeling such problems as POMDPs, has shown great promise but existing belief space planning methods have primarily been applied to cases where robots can be approximated as points or spheres. In this paper, we extend the belief space framework to treat articulated robots where the linkage can be decomposed into convex components. To allow planning and collision avoidance in Gaussian belief spaces, we introduce the concept of sigma hulls: convex hulls of robot links transformed according to the sigma standard deviation boundary points generated by the Unscented Kalman filter (UKF). We characterize the signed distances between sigma hulls and obstacles in the workspace to formulate efficient collision avoidance constraints compatible with the Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GKJ) and Expanding Polytope Algorithms (EPA) within an optimization-based planning framework. We report results in simulation for planning motions for a 4-DOF planar robot and a 7-DOF articulated robot with imprecise actuation and inaccurate sensors. These experiments suggest that the sigma hull framework can significantly reduce the probability of collision and is computationally efficient enough to permit iterative re-planning for model predictive control.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a SPAM (Simultaneous Planning and Mapping) technique for a manipulator type robot working in an uncertain environment via a Best Next Move algorithm. Demands for a smart decision to move a manipulator such as humanoid arms in uncertain or crowded environments call for a simultaneous planning and mapping technique. We assume no a priori knowledge of either the obstacles or the rest of the environment exits. For rapid map building and path planning, we use a skin type setup based on 3D depth camera sensors that completely encompass the entire body of a manipulator. The 3D sensors capture the point clouds used to create an instantaneous c-space map whereby a Best Next Move algorithm directs the motion of the manipulator. The Best Next Move algorithm utilizes the gradient of the density distribution of the k-nearest-neighborhood sets in c-space. It has tendency to travel along the direction by which the point clouds spread in space, thus rendering faster mapping of c-space obstacles. The proposed algorithm is compared with several sensor based algorithms for performance measurement such as map completion rate, distribution of samples, total nodes, etc. Some improved performances are reported for the proposed algorithm. Several possible applications include semi-autonomous tele-robotics planning, humanoid arm path planning, among others.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies the underwater localization problem for a school of robotic fish, i.e., a kind of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles with limited size, power and payload. These robotic fish cannot be equipped with traditional underwater localization sensors that are big and heavy. The proposed localization system is performed by using a single surface mobile beacon which provides range measurement to bound the localization error. The main contribution of this paper lies in twofold: 1) Observability of single beacon based localization is first analyzed in the context of nonlinear discrete time system, deriving a sufficient condition on observability. 2) Moving Horizon Estimation is then integrated with Extended Kalman Filters for three-dimensional localization using single beacon, which can reduce the computational complexity, impose various constraints and make use of previous range measurements for current estimation. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to verify the observability and high localization accuracy of the proposed underwater localization method.",

        "abstract": "New smartphone technologies are emerging which combine head-mounted displays (HMD) with standard functions such as receiving phone calls, emails, and helping with navigation. This opens new opportunities to explore cyber robotics algorithms (robotics sensors and human motor plant). To make these devices more adaptive to the environmental conditions, user behavior, and user preferences, it is important to allow the sensor-equipped devices to efficiently adapt and respond to user activities (e.g., disable incoming phone calls in an elevator, activate video recording while car driving). This paper hence presents a situation awareness system (SAS) for head-mounted smartphones. After collecting data from inertial sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes), and video data (camera), SAS performs activity classification in three steps. Step 1 transforms inertial sensor data into a head orientation-independent and stable normalized coordinate system. Step 2 extracts critical features (statistical, physical, GIST). Step 3 classifies activities (Naive Bayes classifier), distinguishes between environments (Support Vector Machine), and finally combines both results (Hidden Markov Model) for further improvement. SAS has been implemented on a sensor-equipped eyeglasses prototype and achieved high accuracy (81.5%) when distinguishing between 20 real-world activities.",

Furthermore, the robot should be able to infer such skills to handle uncertainties and perturbations, since most robot tasks are usually daily-life tasks that include many unexpected situations. Therefore, we propose a unified skill learning and inference framework. The framework includes six processing modules: 1) a human demonstration process, 2) an autonomous segmentation process, 3) a dynamic movement primitive learning process, 4) a Bayesian network learning process, 5) a motivation graph construction process, and 6) a skill-inferring process. Based on the framework, the robot learns and infers situation-adequate and goal-oriented skills to handle uncertainties and human perturbations. To show the validity of our framework, some experimental results are illustrated using a robot arm that performs a \u2018tea service\u2019 task.",

        "abstract": "Robot programming by demonstration encompasses a wide range of learning strategies, from simple mimicking of the demonstrator's actions to the higher level extraction of the underlying intent. By focusing on this last form, we study the problem of extracting the reward function explaining the demonstrations from a set of candidate reward functions, and using this information for self-refinement of the skill. This definition of the problem has links with inverse reinforcement learning problems in which the robot autonomously extracts an optimal reward function that defines the goal of the task. By relying on Gaussian mixture models, the proposed approach learns how the different candidate reward functions are combined, and in which contexts or phases of the task they are relevant for explaining the user's demonstrations. The extracted reward profile is then exploited to improve the skill with a self-refinement approach based on expectation-maximization, allowing the imitator to reach a skill level that goes beyond the demonstrations. The approach can be used to reproduce a skill in different ways or to transfer tasks across robots of different structures. The proposed approach is tested in simulation with a new type of continuum robot (STIFF-FLOP), using kinesthetic demonstrations from a Barrett WAM manipulator.",

        "abstract": "SkySweeper is a mobile robot designed to operate in an environment of cables, wires, power lines, ropes, et cetera. The robot is comprised of two links pivotally connected at one end; a series elastic actuator at this \u201celbow\u201d joint can actuate relative rotation between the two links. At the opposite end of each link is an actuated three-position clamp. The clamp can either be open, partially closed, such that the clamp can roll (translate) along the cable, or fully closed, such that the clamp can only pivot on the cable. By actuating the elbow joint and cleverly choosing the positions of the clamps, the robot can locomote on the cable in a number of different ways. The particular method of locomotion can be chosen to minimize energy consumption, maximize speed, or traverse an obstacle (e.g. a support from which the cable is suspended). SkySweeper has the potential to locomote in a more energy efficient manner than existing cable-locomoting robots. It also operates with a minimal number of actuators, which reduces cost significantly. Potential applications include power and communication line inspection, suspension bridge inspection and construction, as well as entertainment. Data from a prototype, consisting largely of 3D-printed and off-the-shelf parts, are compared to dynamic simulation results.",

Other than searching through typical appearance attributes such as clothing color and body height, information such as whether a person carries a bag or not is valuable to provide more relevant targeted search. We propose two novel and fast algorithms for sling bag and backpack detection based on the geometrical properties of bags. The advantage of the proposed algorithms is that it does not require shape information from human silhouettes therefore it can work under crowded condition. In addition, the absence of background subtraction makes the algorithms suitable for mobile platforms such as robots. The system was tested with a low resolution surveillance video dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is promising.",

Humans can identify such events using a combination of superficial and deep mechanoreceptors. In robotic hands, with more limited tactile sensing, such events can be hard to distinguish. This paper presents a signal processing method that can help to distinguish finger/object and object/world events based on multidimensional coherence, which measures whether a group of signals are sampling a single input or a group of incoherent inputs. A simple linear model of the fingertip/object interaction demonstrates how signal coherence can be used for slip classification. The method is evaluated through controlled experiments that produce similar results for two very different tactile sensing suites.",

        "abstract": "Real-time shape sensing and state acquisition is important for closed-loop control of hyper-redundant snake robots in minimally invasive surgery. Due to the miniaturized size of such minimally invasive surgery robots, it is not feasible to use existing angular sensors involving rotary encoders. With recent advances of the MEMS technology, micro inertial sensors have shown their potential for robot state estimation. Previous studies have demonstrated that accurate joint angles can be estimated for one degree-of-freedom (DoF) joints. However, higher DoF joints of the robot can impose a number of challenges to the current joint angle estimation methods. This paper presents a micro-sensing platform and shape reconstruction algorithm for minimally invasive surgery snake robot with two DoF joints. The method incorporates both gravitational and gyroscopic sensing for calculating the rotation difference between any consecutive robot segments. The gyroscope measurements are first used as the input to predict the rotation difference by direct orientation integration. The orientation difference is then derived from the consecutive acceleration vectors to update the prediction through a complementary filter. To demonstrate the performance of our proposed approach, a robot prototype with two universal joints was fabricated. Detailed experimental results have demonstrated that high accuracy can be achieved by using the proposed method for joint angle estimation.",

Toward this goal, we propose a novel framework that can model context-dependent human spatial interactions, encoded in the form of a social map. The core idea of our approach resides in modelling human personal spaces as non-linearly scaled probability functions within the robotic state space and devise the structure and shape of a social map by solving a learning problem in kernel space. The social borders are subsequently obtained as isocontours of the learned implicit function that can realistically model arbitrarily complex social interactions of varying shape and size. We present our experiments using a rich dataset of human interactions, demonstrating the feasibility and utility of the proposed approach and promoting its application to social mapping of human-populated environments.",

        "abstract": "We propose a social navigation model that allows a robot to navigate in a human environment according to human intentions, in particular during a situation where the human encounters a robot and he/she wants to avoid, unavoid (maintain his/her course), or approach the robot. Avoiding, unavoiding, and approaching trajectories of humans are classified based on the face orientation on a social force model and their predicted motion. The proposed model is developed based on human motion and behavior (especially face orientation and overlapping personal space) analysis in preliminary experiments. Our experimental evidence demonstrates that the robot is able to adapt its motion by preserving personal distance from passers-by, and approaching persons who want to interact with the robot. This work contributes to the future development of a human-robot socialization environment.",

By modelling such tasks as an approximate hybrid dynamical system with time-based switching, we develop a systematic methodology to simultaneously optimize control commands, stiffness profiles and temporal aspect of the movement such as switching instances and total movement duration. Numerical evaluations on a simple switching system, a realistic brachiating robot model with VSA, and a hopper with variable stiffness springs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "The cerebellum is a brain structure necessary for skilled motor behaviour and has a well understood and repetitive architecture. Such an architecture inspired the Marr-Albus-Ito theory of cerebellar learning, that provides an explanation for the acquisition of motor skills by the cerebellum. Numerous computational models inspired in such a theory have already been employed in robotic tasks. Here we look into one of the suggested roles of the cerebellum, the replacement of reflexes by anticipatory actions and we apply it to a robot navigation task. The acquisition of anticipatory actions has been thoroughly studied in the field of classical conditioning. Of particular interest is the so-called CS-intensity effect, an effect that links the rapidity of execution of an anticipatory protective action, the Conditioned Response (CR), to the intensity of a predictive signal, the Conditioning Stimulus (CS). We propose that the CS-intensity effect implements a built-in sensory-motor contingency that allows to carry over a skill learned in a safe and easy context, e.g., turning at slow velocity, to a more difficult one, e.g., a turning at a faster speed. We demonstrate this hypothesis in a series of experiments where a robot has to navigate a track that has a turn. We show that after being trained at a slow velocity, by means of the CS-intensity effect, the cerebellar controller modulates the turning such that its onset anticipates as the robot speed increases. Ultimately, through incremental learning, this generalization allows the robot to learn to navigate the track at its maximum speed.",

In the context of morphological computation one could see such complex structures as potential computational resources. In this study, we implement and exploit this view point in a spine-driven quadruped robot called Kitty by using its flexible spine as a computational resource. The spine is an actuated multi-joint structure consisting of a sequence of soft silicone blocks. Its complex dynamics are captured by a set of force sensors and used to construct a closed-loop to drive the motor commands. We use simple static, linear readout weights to combine the sensor values to generate multiple gait patterns (bounding, trotting, turning behavior). In addition, we demonstrate the robustness of the setup by applying strong external perturbations in form of additional loads. The system is able to fully recover to its nominal gait patterns (which are encoded in the linear readout weights) after the perturbation has vanished.",

This paper then conducts numerical analyses to examine the effects of non-instantaneous DLS motion on the gait properties such as stability and energy efficiency. First, we divide the gait cycle into the collision and the stance phases and numerically evaluate their stability in terms of the convergence rate. Second, we analyze the stability in more detail by dividing the stance phase into the periods of DLS and single-limb support. The simulation results show that the energy efficiency monotonically worsens with the increase of the ratio of the period of DLS to the gait cycle but the convergence rate improves. Furthermore, we discuss the similarities between robot walking and human walking based on the analysis results obtained.",

        "abstract": "Tele-surgery has been more and more popular in robotassisted medical intervention. Most existing teleoperation architectures for medical applications adopt 2-channel architectures. The 2-channel architectures have been evaluated in literature and it is shown that some architectures, e.g. position-force (P-F), are able to provide the surgeon a reliable haptic sense of the working environment (transparency). However, stability of these P-F architecture is still a considerable concern especially when physiological disturbances exist in the remote environment. P-PF architecture is proved to provide a convenient alternative. With one more channel 3-channel teleoperation architectures present promising options due to their augmented design flexibility. This paper evaluates stability and transparency of general 3-channel bilateral teleoperation control architectures and provides a design framework guidelines to improve the architectures' stability robustness and optimize the transparency. Simulation evaluations are provided to illustrate how the optimal 3-channel teleoperation architecture is chosen for medical applications given their dedicated requirements.",

        "abstract": "A legged robot has to deal with environmental contacts every time it takes a step. To properly handle these interactions, it is desirable to be able to set the foot compliance. For an actively-compliant legged robot, in order to ensure a stable contact with the environment the robot leg has to be passive at the contact point. In this work, we asses some passivity and stability issues of the actively-compliant leg of the quadruped robot HyQ, which employs a highperformance cascade compliance controller. We demonstrate that both the nested torque loop performance as well as the actuator bandwidth have a strong influence in the range of virtual impedances that can be passively rendered by the robot leg. Based on the stability analyses and experimental results, we propose a procedure for designing cascade compliance controllers. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that the HyQ's actively-compliant leg is able to reproduce the compliant behavior presented by an identical but passively-compliant version of the same leg.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an integrated control framework for balancing humanoids on uneven terrains combining stabilization control and terrain inclination estimation. The stabilization is realized by passivity based admittance control that utilizes the force/torque feedback in feet to actively regulate the compliance. The logic-based terrain estimation algorithm exploits feet to probe the terrain inclination and deals with underactuation when feet tilt on the contact surface. The equilibrium position in the admittance control is thereby adapted for recovering balance on the slope. Both the theoretical work and experimental validation are presented. The method is implemented and validated on the real humanoid by demonstrating the capability of estimating terrain inclination, balancing on the slope with varying gradient, and maintaining upright posture in the meantime. Experimental data such as inclination estimation in the comparison study, center of pressure measurement, and body attitude compensation are presented and analyzed.",

Using the conventional mechanical-electrical analogy, the multilateral teleoperation system with mechanical nature is modelled as an electrical circuit. Power correlated signal are then identified to extract the augmented network representation in which time-delay is taken into account. The passivity of multilateral teleoperation system are also analyzed and the method of using TDPA to passivate the network is proposed. This framework is independent of control architecture and communication delay. Experiment on a trilateral teleoperation system has been done and showed good performance with proposed method.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper investigates how a walker could estimate the variability of an arbitrary set of state variables when migrating on visco-elastic grounds. The state variables are a function of both the visco-elastic settings of the walking body and soft terrain parameters. A rimless wheel model was developed using a Lagrangian approach in order to obtain analytical solutions for migration across ground conditions. An algorithm was then developed to determine the steady value of the variables as a function of the difference in ground and hub parameters involved in the migration. A generalised migration metaparameter, \u0394g, function of this difference, was then extrapolated using polynomial approximation. \u0394g can be used to estimate the expected variability at a state given information on actual and previous ground parameters. A second parameter, \u0394h, describing local variability of a given state on a given terrain, is used to generate a predictive algorithm capable of stabilising the rimless wheel setup when subject to an abrupt change in ground parameters. We actuate the rimless wheel with a constant torque leaving it to develop any speed profile for a given visco-elastic impedance distribution of the ground and its own vertical visco-elastic impedance. The ground is altered depending on the two migration meta-parameters (\u0394g and \u0394r), ensuring both local and migration stability.",

The key idea is to extract information from the kinematic constraints given through the intermittent contacts with the ground and to fuse this information with inertial measurements. To this end, we design an unscented Kalman filter based on a consistent formulation of the underlying stochastic model. To increase the robustness of the filter, an outliers rejection methodology is included into the update step. Furthermore, we present the nonlinear observability analysis of the system, where, by considering the special nature of 3D rotations, we obtain a relatively simple form of the corresponding observability matrix. This yields, that, except for the global position and the yaw angle, all states are in general observable. This also holds if only one foot is in contact with the ground. The presented filter is evaluated on a real quadruped robot trotting over an uneven and slippery terrain.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we propose a steering control method for a cycling wheelchair. The commercially available cycling wheelchair is a pedal-driven system that is similar to a bicycle, and patients with impairment of their lower extremities can move the wheelchair based on the pedaling force if they can slightly move their legs by themselves. The user can also change the wheelchair direction using the steering handle. However, right and left turns are perceived differently and a large steering torque is required while operating the steering handle because of hardware problems associated with the cycling wheelchair. To overcome this problem, we propose a new hardware solution and a method for steering motion control using servo brakes for the cycling wheelchair. The proposed method is applied to the developed cycling wheelchair, and the experimental results illustrate the validity of the system.",

        "abstract": "We introduce our new quadrotor platform for realizing autonomous navigation in unknown indoor/outdoor environments. Autonomous waypoint navigation, obstacle avoidance and flight control is implemented on-board. The system does not require a special environment, artificial markers or an external reference system. We developed a monolithic, mechanically damped perception unit which is equipped with a stereo camera pair, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), two processor-and an FPGA board. Stereo images are processed on the FPGA by the Semi-Global Matching algorithm. Keyframe-based stereo odometry is fused with IMU data compensating for time delays that are induced by the vision pipeline. The system state estimate is used for control and on-board 3D mapping. An operator can set waypoints in the map, while the quadrotor autonomously plans its path avoiding obstacles. We show experiments with the quadrotor flying from inside a building to the outside and vice versa, traversing a window and a door respectively. A video of the experiments is part of this work. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first autonomously flying system with complete on-board processing that performs waypoint navigation with obstacle avoidance in geometrically unconstrained, complex indoor/outdoor environments.",

In order to gradually transition from passive exercise to exercises with more voluntary movements, it is important to reduce the assistance provided by the therapist in stages. Since stiffness control is the key factor of assistance adjustment in robotic movement rehabilitation, this paper focuses on stiffness control as a tool to adjust the assistance in stages. It is necessary to set a proper stiffness ellipse to perform assistance with directivity, especially in the case of active-assistive exercise. The performance of the proposed stiffness control for exercise therapy is validated through experimental results.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces two objective functions for computing the expected cost in the Stochastic Collection and Replenishment (SCAR) scenario. In the SCAR scenario, multiple user agents have a limited supply of a resource that they either use or collect, depending on the scenario. To enable persistent autonomy, dedicated replenishment agents travel to the user agents and replenish or collect their supply of the resource, thus allowing them to operate indefinitely in the field. Of the two objective functions, one uses a Monte Carlo method, while the other uses a significantly faster analytical method. Approximations to multiplication, division and inversion of Gaussian distributed variables are used to facilitate propagation of probability distributions in the analytical method when Gaussian distributed parameters are used. The analytical objective function is shown to have greater than 99% comparison accuracy when compared with the Monte Carlo objective function while achieving speed gains of several orders of magnitude.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method to compute the pose-graph loop-closure constraints using multiple non/minimal overlapping field-of-views cameras mounted rigidly on a self-driving car without the need to reconstruct any 3D scene points. In particular, we show that the relative pose with metric scale between two loop-closing pose-graph vertices can be directly obtained from the epipolar geometry of the multicameras system. As a result, we avoid the additional time complexities and uncertainties from the reconstruction of 3D scene points which are needed by standard monocular and stereo approaches. In addition, there is a greater flexibility in choosing a configuration for the multi-camera system to cover a wider field-of-view so as to avoid missing out any loop-closure opportunities. We show that by expressing the point correspondences between two frames as Pl\u00fccker lines and enforcing the planar motion constraint on the car, we are able to use multiple cameras as one and formulate the relative pose problem for loop-closure as a minimal problem which requires 3-point correspondences that yields up to six real solutions. The RANSAC algorithm is used to determine the correct solution and for robust estimation. We verify our method with results from multiple large-scale real-world data.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces superiority of pinching force accuracy and band when our developed pinching force support system augments a human's pinching force, allowing direct contact of human fingers and fixing distribution ratio of the supporting force. A user with our exoskeleton support system adjusts his/her pinching force according to a task based on his/her sensory feedback information that is made available by a direct contact with a pinching object. In addition to the direct contact, the exoskeleton pushes a user's finger with a constant rate of supporting force for reduction of the affecting force on the human finger, and then the rest of the supporting force directly acts on the pinching object. In contrast, most of conventional gripping assistive robots interfere with haptic sense of a user finger and with stable and dexterous manipulation based on the tactile sense because they covers a user's fingers with their exoskeleton. Through some experiments, this paper reports that our exoskeleton achieves high precision and wide band of the pinching force, comparing with the human performance and with performance of different structure of the exoskeletons.",

Recently, the subgraph-preconditioned conjugate gradient method has been proposed to combine the advantages of two reigning paradigms, direct and iterative methods, to improve the efficiency of the solver. Yet the question of how to pick a good subgraph is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a new metric to measure the quality of a spanning tree preconditioner based on support theory. We use this metric to develop an algorithm to find good subgraph preconditioners and apply them to solve the SLAM problem. The results show that although the proposed algorithm is not fast enough, the new metric is effective and resulting subgraph preconditioners significantly improve the efficiency of the state-of-the-art solver.",

MSY is an optimal approach to the problem of maximizing sustainable foraging where the resources harvested are replenished by logistic growth, e.g. living things. Over-harvesting reduces both the instantaneous resource availability and growth rate, and above some threshold will permanently deplete resources. Under-harvesting is sustainable, but fails to maximally exploit the resources. We describe a system model and use it to determine the optimal allocation of robot work to resource-producing `patches'. We give a practical illustration of a troublesome feature of MSY: it is too sensitive for a fixed allocation to be sustainable in practice. We show how to centrally allocate a number of robots to each patch, and then locally adapt the work rate of each robot to achieve sustainable and near-optimal foraging. This is the first study of robot foraging where the robots' activity modifies the productivity and sustainability of the environment.",

        "abstract": "For the effective use of motor power, an appropriate gear ratio has to be selected according to the robot task and motion. Because a jumping robot, in particular, requires both high torque and high velocity properties through the motion, a varying gear ratio is necessary. Moreover, it has to be optimally designed and realized. In this paper, we design a jumping robot with a non-circular gear that changes the gear ratio through the motion for the higher jumping. Based on statics, the gear ratio is optimized and change of the gear ratio is obtained by a simulation-based design considering the robot dynamics. So far, we have developed a design method of no-circular gear, and its effectiveness was evaluated by simulation. In this paper, a jumping robot is prototyped, and the effectiveness is evaluated by experiment containing the robustness for the perturbation of robot parameters.",

As fin locomotion is a novel and complex research area, basic control concepts are analyzed and implemented. Based on a simulation, a fin-trajectory morphing control strategy is developed in order to control the robots roll, pitch and yaw rates, thus allowing the robot to follow a given vector. Absolute position control or depth control, however, is not yet implemented. The paper concludes with the presentation of a working system that demonstrated motion capabilities in air as well as the first dive test in a swimming pool.",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of systematically covering all accessible floor space in an unknown environment by a mobile robot. Our approach uses rectangular regions that are swept across the environment. In the first stage, the robot covers each region using the classic boustrophedon pattern and planning paths to uncovered areas within the region while keeping track of its position uncertainty. The region is then moved sideways to cover the next part of the environment until all accessible space has been visited. In the second stage, the robot revisits the perimeter around the obstacles. We compare our method in terms of total trajectory length to 5 off-line methods including the distance transformation by Zelinsky et al. [1] in a standard test environment as well as in multi-room homes. The presented method has been employed in our Mint cleaning robot [2] for autonomously sweeping and mopping the floors.",

Various devices and systems have been introduced for supporting human communication, and most of them are based on visual and auditory media. For presenting tactile sensations, some tactile actuators have been introduced recently, however these actuators require real objects to generate the various tactile sensations and input data to be associated with output tactile sensations should be prepared manually by a user. This study introduces an algorithm to automatically generate parameters from an object's image for driving tactile actuators.

        "abstract": "This study proposes a novel technique to display tactile sensation using electro-rheological fluid (ERF). ERF changes its rheological characteristics according to the electric field applied. The ERF used in this study generates relatively high yield stress and behaves as a solid when subjected to a strong electric field. Using this solid-liquid phase transition, we propose a novel device which provides a tactile sensation, i.e., tactile bump display. Applying electric field at a specific position in an ERF chamber, the corresponding ERF behaves as solid at the position. This solid-state ERF gives tactile sensation like a physical bump to a user. We fabricate in this study a prototype, which may realize the above-mentioned idea, and characterize it. We obtained the following results by experiments. First, the tactile bump display could make the users recognize their finger position on a flat surface by creating a tactile bump. Second, we confirmed that the tactile bump might significantly improve the accuracy and the precision of touch typing.",

Starting with an RGB-D view of a tangled rope, our goal is to infer its knot structure and then choose appropriate manipulation actions that result in the rope getting untangled. We design appropriate features and present an inference algorithm based on particle filters to infer the rope's structure. Our learning algorithm is based on max-margin learning. We then choose an appropriate manipulation action based on the current knot structure and other properties such as slack in the rope. We then repeatedly perform perception and manipulation until the rope is untangled. We evaluate our algorithm extensively on a dataset having five different types of ropes and 10 different types of knots. We then perform robotic experiments, in which our bimanual manipulator (PR2) untangles ropes successfully 76.9% of the time.",

This paper presents a drawer-type storage system for supporting object search, \u201cTansuBot\u201d. By using this system and a smart device (e.g. smart phone), a user can review the photos of contents stored in the system. In addition, the system can present candidate drawers where the searching target object may be stored based on preliminary information such as usage histories. Concretely, LED blinking and pop-up actions (pushing drawers forward) are used for display. To realize these supports, a stacker crane type wall-moving robot is equipped at the backside of storage. The robot has a movable camera and mechanisms to push a drawer forward. For easy installation to a home, storage efficiency and cost reduction should be considered in the design of the instrument. Especially for cost reduction, this paper presents an approach to use wooden parts for main mechanisms. This approach also contributes to user-friendly presence and appearance of the instrument. This paper reports about the development of a prototype and an experiment to evaluate the functions for supporting object search. The results of the experiment prove the importance of the functions realized by the system; displaying contents' photos on a smart device and showing candidate drawers to investigate. The outcomes indicate that those functions have positive effects on reduction of searching time and mental burden.",

The generated trajectories are collision-free and satisfy the task constraint with arbitrary accuracy. Bounds on the achievable generalized velocities may also be taken into account. The proposed approach is validated through planning experiments on a 7-dof articulated robot and an 8-dof mobile manipulator.",

        "abstract": "To plan complex motions of robots with many degrees of freedom, our novel, very flexible framework builds task-relevant roadmaps (TRMs), using a new sampling-based optimizer called Natural Gradient Inverse Kinematics (NGIK) based on natural evolution strategies (NES). To build TRMs, NGIK iteratively optimizes postures covering task-spaces expressed by arbitrary task-functions, subject to constraints expressed by arbitrary cost-functions, transparently dealing with both hard and soft constraints. TRMs are grown to maximally cover the task-space while minimizing costs. Unlike Jacobian-based methods, our algorithm does not rely on calculation of gradients, making application of the algorithm much simpler. We show how NGIK outperforms recent related sampling algorithms. A video demo (http://youtu.be/N6x2e1Zf_yg) successfully applies TRMs to an iCub humanoid robot with 41 DOF in its upper body, arms, hands, head, and eyes. To our knowledge, no similar methods exhibit such a degree of flexibility in defining movements.",

In this control system, several characteristics of the configuration of the swarm robots are encoded as task functions, for which a human operator can specify desired values that are conveyed to the end-effector of the master robot. Stability and tracking performance of the proposed control system are investigated in the presence of communication delays so that the swarm robots can be manipulated remotely. Moreover, the swarm robots, which perform like a redundant robotic system, can also regulate their position to achieve secondary tasks autonomously. The proposed control algorithms are validated via numerical simulations on a 3-DOF robot manipulator with a group of mobile robots.",

        "abstract": "In minimally invasive robotic surgery, slender instruments are used that provide additional degrees of freedom inside the human body. Kinematic limitations due to the instrument could endanger the secure execution of a surgical task. Numerous design alternatives are proposed in literature whereas few work is done that evaluates the performance of these instruments objectively. This paper presents a new method to evaluate alternative designs of instrument kinematics with respect to their ability to perform surgical tasks. Two specific criteria are set up accounting for the limited space during a minimally invasive intervention as well as for the ability to execute the desired task. The evaluation is based on task specific reference trajectories which are recorded in one orientation. During robotic surgery, arbitrary orientations of this area can occur. The method is able to handle this by rotating the acquired reference trajectories within software. The presented method is independent from the setup, i.e. the relative position and orientation of the area of interest with respect to the trocar location. Four different examples demonstrate the application of the method to show its usefulness.",

Since the desired behavior of the robots highly depends on the application, we need flexible means for teaching a robot a certain navigation policy. We present an approach that allows a mobile robot to learn how to navigate in the presence of humans while it is being teleoperated in its designated environment. Our method applies feature-based maximum entropy learning to derive a navigation policy from the interactions with the humans. The resulting policy maintains a probability distribution over the trajectories of all the agents that allows the robot to cooperatively avoid collisions with humans. In particular, our method reasons about multiple homotopy classes of the agents' trajectories, i. e., on which sides the agents pass each other. We implemented our approach on a real mobile robot and demonstrate that it is able to successfully navigate in an office environment in the presence of humans relying only on on-board sensors.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel synergy driven teleimpedance controller for the Pisa-IIT SoftHand is presented. Towards the development of an efficient, robust, and low-cost hand prothesis, the Pisa-IIT SoftHand is built on the motor control principle of synergies, through which the immense complexity of the hand is simplified into distinct motor patterns. As the SoftHand grasps, it follows a synergistic path with built-in flexibility to allow grasping of objects of various shapes using only a single motor. In this work, the hand grasping motion is regulated with an impedance controller which incorporates the user's postural and stiffness synergy profiles in realtime. In addition, a disturbance observer is realized which estimates the grasping contact force. The estimated force is then fedback to the user via a vibration motor. Grasp robustness and transparency improvements were evaluated on two healthy subjects while grasping different objects. Implementation of the proposed teleimpedance controller led to the execution of stable grasps by controlling the grasping forces, via modulation of hand compliance. In addition, utilization of the vibrotactile feedback resulted in reduced physical load on the user. While these results need to be validated with amputees, they provide evidence that a low-cost, robust hand employing hardware-based synergies is a viable alternative to traditional myoelectric prostheses.",

In this paper, a teleoperated system for robotic surgery is introduced, able to guide the surgeon towards a target anatomy by providing her with force feedback based on Virtual Fixtures (VF). The teleoperated system has a redundant slave robot. A closed-form inverse kinematics is proposed to solve redundancy that is based on an optimization approach in one variable. Four different cost objective functions are proposed in the paper and one is implemented and validated, i.e. the cost function aimed at minimizing the amount of space of the robot in the operative theater during the surgical procedure. The proposed teleoperated architecture has been tested on a teleoperated system composed of a 3-DoFs haptic joystick and a 7-DoFs anthropomorphic manipulator. Experimental tests on 12 volunteer subjects have been carried out. Results demonstrate that a force feedback based on VF provides a statistically significant enhancement of procedure accuracy.",

A state-of-the-art free-viewpoint image generation technique is employed to generate the scene presented to the operator. In addition, an augmented reality technique is used to superimpose a 3D model of the robot onto the generated scenes.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a surgical master-slave tele-operation system for percutaneous interventional procedures under continuous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance. This system consists of a piezoelectrically actuated slave robot for needle placement with integrated fiber optic force sensor utilizing Fabry-Perot interferometry (FPI) sensing principle. The sensor flexure is optimized and embedded to the slave robot for measuring needle insertion force. A novel, compact opto-mechanical FPI sensor interface is integrated into an MRI robot control system. By leveraging the complementary features of pneumatic and piezoelectric actuation, a pneumatically actuated haptic master robot is also developed to render force associated with needle placement interventions to the clinician. An aluminum load cell is implemented and calibrated to close the impedance control loop of the master robot. A force-position control algorithm is developed to control the hybrid actuated system. Teleoperated needle insertion is demonstrated under live MR imaging, where the slave robot resides in the scanner bore and the user manipulates the master beside the patient outside the bore. Force and position tracking results of the master-slave robot are demonstrated to validate the tracking performance of the integrated system. It has a position tracking error of 0.318mm and sine wave force tracking error of 2.227N.",

        "abstract": "This work is aimed at developing a new minimally invasive approach to characterize tissue properties in real time during telerobotic palpation and to localize tissue abnormality while estimating its depth. This method relies on using a minimally invasive probe with a rigidly mounted tactile sensor at the tip to capture the force distribution map and the indentation depth by each tactile element and thereby generating a stiffness map for the palpated tissue. The hybrid impedance control technique is used for this approach to enable the operator to switch between position control and force control and thereby to autonomously obtain the required information from the remote tissue. The operator would then be able to localize tissue abnormality based on the force distribution map, the tissue stiffness map and the indentation depth which are visually presented to him/her in real time. This method also enables the operator to estimate the depth at which the tissue abnormality is located.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a robot motion planning problem from a specification given as a syntactically co-safe linear temporal logic formula over a set of properties known to be satisfied at the regions of an unknown environment. The robot is assumed to be equipped with deterministic motion and accurate sensing capabilities. The environment is assumed to be partitioned into a finite number of identical square cells. By bringing together tools from formal verification, graph theory, and grid-based exploration, we develop an incremental algorithm that makes progress towards satisfying the specification while the robot discovers the environment using its local sensors. We show that the algorithm is sound and complete. We illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach through a simulated case study.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, tension propagation analysis of a newly designed multi-DOF robotic platform for single-port access surgery (SPS) is presented. The analysis is based on instantaneous kinematics of the proposed 6-DOF surgical instrument, and provides the decision criteria for estimating the payload of a surgical instrument according to its pose changes and specifications of a driving-wire. Also, the wiretension and the number of reduction ratio to manage such a payload can be estimated, quantitatively. The analysis begins with derivation of the power transmission efficiency through wire-interfaces from each instrument joint to an actuator. Based on the energy conservation law and the capstan equation, we modeled the degradation of power transmission efficiency due to 1) the reducer called wire-reduction mechanism, 2) bending of proximal instrument joints, and 3) bending of hyper-redundant guide tube. Based on the analysis, the tension of driving-wires was computed according to various manipulation poses and loading conditions. In our experiment, a newly designed surgical instrument successfully managed the external load of 1kgf, which was applied to the end effector of a surgical manipulator.",

        "abstract": "In human skin, the ability to spatially discriminate an individual indentation from two simultaneous indentations is tailored to the need of the specific area of application on the human body. While the spatial resolution is comparatively low over wide areas of the human body, there are no insensitive spots. In addition, the measuring range is tuned to the expected loads on the respective part of the human body. Within this study these observations are utilized to solve some of the key challenges on the way towards an artificial skin as a whole-body cover for robotic systems. To enable the reliable detection of collision events which are commonly of very short duration the reaction time of the artificial skin system has to be minimized. In order to do so, the goal conflict between the required number of taxels and the required high readout frequencies has to be solved. We present the DLR approach towards scalable transduction hardware and readout electronics as a basis for the acquisition of tactile information from future whole-body covers. First experiments with prototypes of the DLR Artificial Skin demonstrate the scalability of the transduction hardware with respect to size, spatial resolution and measuring range.",

        "abstract": "How a robot approaches a person greatly determines the interaction that follows. This is particularly relevant when the person has never interacted with the robot before. In human communication, we exchange a multitude of multimodal signals to communicate our intent while we approach others. However, most robots do not have the capabilities to produce such signals and easily communicate their intent. In this paper we propose to communicate intent when a robot approaches a person through functional noise and approach speed. Both were manipulated in a between-subjects experiment (N=40) either slowly increasing at the start of the approach and slowly decreasing when the robot reached the human or maximized at the start and abruptly stopped at the end of the approach. We analyzed questionnaires and video data from the interaction and found that particularly functional noise that in-/decreased in volume was helpful to communicate the robot's intent but only in congruence with an in-/decreasing velocity.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the application of a hydraulic DC-DC converter, namely a step down Buck Converter to the actuation of a robot leg that is part of the quadruped robot HyQ. The use of a Hydraulic Buck Converter (HBC) offers significant advantages in terms of improved efficiency of hydraulic actuation systems analogously to an electric switching DC-DC converter as opposed to a rheostatic-type system. In this paper, a HBC consisting of two digital valves and two check valves is introduced to improve the efficiency performance of a singl leg of a hydraulic quadruped robot (HyQ). This type of hydraulic buck converter is able to support the locomotion in two directions. The HBC operates at a switching frequency of 100 Hz in pulse-width-modulation. The better energy performance compared to proportional control is achieved by the use of fast check valves. The performance of the system with a 3-way-4-position proportional valve is compared with the HBC drive. A test rig is set up to investigate the performance of HBC with two different controllers and a Hydraulic Proportional Drive (HPD) system, based on proportional valves which control flow, by throttling it, in a dissipative manner. The performance of position tracking and energy consumption is evaluated. The experimental results indicate that HBC systems can achieve similar position tracking with relatively less consumed energy.",

The missions are defined by a set of Points of Interest (PoI) and UAVs should pass through them. A module to detect and identify thermals is implemented to exploit their energy and extend the flight duration, known as static soaring. A collision-free trajectory planner based on the RRT\u2217 (Optimal Rapidly-exploring Random Trees) planning algorithm is implemented. The proposed system allows applications in real time because of its low computational needs. Simulations and experiments carried out in the airfield of La Cartuja (Seville, Spain) show the performance and advantages of the proposed system.",

We introduce the \u201cEnhanced Centroidal Moment Pivot point\u201d (eCMP) and the \u201cVirtual Repellent Point\u201d (VRP), which allow for the encoding of both direction and magnitude of the external (e.g. leg) forces and the total force (i.e. external forces plus gravity) acting on the robot. Based on eCMP, VRP and DCM, we present a method for real-time planning and control of DCM trajectories in 3D. We address the problem of underactuation and propose methods to guarantee feasibility of the finally commanded forces. The capabilities of the proposed control framework are verified in simulations.",

With concern to the sudden dynamic changes during maneuver, the dynamical model is derived and used together with the force-angle stability measure (FASM) to estimate the tip-over incident and the tipping direction. A single gimbal control moment gyro (SGCMG) is proposed to counter the instability by producing a precession torque in the opposite direction of the estimated tip-over direction. Simulation results are given to demonstrate the performance of this approach.",

We consider two-dimensional configuration spaces. At any point in time, the robots' map consists of known, partially-mapped obstacles. The unknown, yet-to-be-explored area is mapped to a single point, thus giving us a quotient space. The topological classes on the quotient space allows us to define topological classes of trajectories connecting a robot pose to the unknown region in the original configuration space. Robots explore this configuration space choosing different homology classes when confronted by obstacles or walls. We illustrate the basic idea with simulations of small teams of robots. Experiments with a single robot illustrate the applicability of the method to robots that have small sensor footprints and limited computational resources. We also provide comparisons with a standard frontier-based algorithm.",

In this paper, we explore how stochastic motion models and weak encounter information can be exploited to learn topological information about an unknown environment. Our system behavior mimics a probabilistic motion model of cockroaches, as it is inspired by current biobotic (cyborg insect) systems. We employ tools from algebraic topology to extract spatial information of the environment based on neighbor to neighbor interactions among the biologically inspired agents with no need for localization data. This information is used to build a map of persistent topological features of the environment. We analyze the performance of our estimation and propose a switching control mechanism for the motion models to extract features of complex environments in an effective way.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this study is to provide an architecture for a generic definition of robot manipulation actions. We emphasize that the representation of actions presented here is \u201cprocedural\u201d. Thus, we will define the structural elements of our action representations as execution protocols. To achieve this, manipulations are defined using three levels. The toplevel defines objects, their relations and the actions in an abstract and symbolic way. A mid-level sequencer, with which the action primitives are chained, is used to structure the actual action execution, which is performed via the bottom level. This (lowest) level collects data from sensors and communicates with the control system of the robot. This method enables robot manipulators to execute the same action in different situations i.e. on different objects with different positions and orientations. In addition, two methods of detecting action failure are provided which are necessary to handle faults in system. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, several different actions are performed on our robotic setup and results are shown. This way we are creating a library of human-like robot actions, which can be used by higher-level task planners to execute more complex tasks.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous capabilities for manipulating randomly piled objects may enhance current methods of path planning and open a new field of development for mobile manipulation and Urban Search And Rescue (USAR) robotics. This paper introduces the challenge of achieving such manipulation capabilities and as a first step presents three algorithms, including a proposed novel solution, for the selection of objects to remove from a pile. The proposed algorithm determines a removability rank for each object according to the degree of its encapsulation within other objects. Using the contact vectors of the examined object, it is possible to obtain the motions that will not violate the object's unilateral contact constraints. The removability rank of the object is proportional to the union of all such motions. All algorithms were tested in simulation in full and partial knowledge modes, and evaluated on a physical robot with a simple manipulator and sensor. This work contributes: the introduction of an important autonomous manipulation challenge, the solution of which will be useful in the field of manipulation in general and USAR in particular; a specific novel algorithm for the construction of disassembly plans for piled objects; and an experimental evaluation of three algorithms targeted at such construction.",

However, the quadrotor configuration's innate simplicity and inexpensive construction recommends its use in many aerial robotics applications. We present a four-rotor configuration that merges the simplicity of a quadrotor with the energy efficiency of a helicopter, while improving manoeuvering rotor bandwidth. This class of aircraft, called a `Y4' or `triangular quadrotor', consists of a single fixed-pitch main rotor with three smaller rotors on booms that provide both counter-torque and manoeuvering control. Our analysis indicates that a Y4 may provide a 20 per cent reduction in hovering power required, compared with a similarly sized conventional quadrotor. Using a matched pair of quadrotor/triangular quadrotor aircraft, our preliminary experiments show that the test-bed Y4 used 15 per cent less power, without optimisation. We present a dynamic model and demonstrate experimentally that the aircraft can be stabilised in flight with PID control.",

        "abstract": "In the state-of-the-art approaches to SLAM, the problem is often formulated as a non-linear least squares. SLAM back-ends often employ iterative methods such as Gauss-Newton or Levenberg-Marquardt to solve that problem. In general, there is no guarantee on the global convergence of these methods. The back-end might get trapped into a local minimum or even diverge depending on how good the initial estimate is. Due to the large noise in odometry data, it is not wise to rely on dead reckoning for obtaining an initial guess, especially in long trajectories. In this paper we demonstrate how M-estimation can be used as a bootstrapping technique to obtain a reliable initial guess. We show that this initial guess is more likely to be in the basin of attraction of the global minimum than existing bootstrapping methods. As the main contribution of this paper, we present new insights about the similarities between robustness against outliers and robustness against a bad initial guess. Through simulations and experiments on real data, we substantiate the reliability of our proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Robots with Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSA) are intrinsically flexible in the joints. The built-in mechanical spring not only has the advantage of a higher peak performance, but also leads to a more robust robot. This paper presents and analyzes the threats to a VSA equipped robot that arise from external or internal origin. Influences of mechanical, moisture, electrical, thermal, radiation, and chemical nature are identified. Protection methods from these threats are discussed and the results presented. The results are separated into hardware, observation, control limiters, and reaction strategies. A hierarchical implementation of the control limiters and reaction strategies is presented. The reaction strategies use a motor position deviation and a change in the stiffness setup to reduce the load at high passive deflections in the VSA. Control limiter and reaction strategies have been implemented in the DLR Hand Arm System and evaluated experimentally with impacts on the system.",

Soft actuators comprised of elastomeric materials with integrated channels that function as pneumatic networks (PneuNets), are designed and geometrically analyzed to produce bending motions that can safely conform with the human finger motion. Bending curvature and force response of these actuators are investigated using geometrical analysis and a finite element model (FEM) prior to fabrication. The fabrication procedure of the chosen actuator is described followed by a series of experiments that mechanically characterize the actuators. The experimental data is compared to results obtained from FEM simulations showing good agreement. Finally, an open-palm glove design and the integration of the actuators to it are described, followed by a qualitative evaluation study.",

        "abstract": "Traditional 2D single-legged hoppers were able to demonstrate stable bi-directional running in a closed-loop approach. In contrast, we employ an open-loop control to achieve high-speed (\u22480.8 m/sec or 1.78 mph) bi-directional dynamic running of the reconfigurable leg length hopper (RLLH). Our hopper has variable linear joint in series with a passive spring that allows changing its effective leg length in realtime. Furthermore by instantaneously changing the leg length at a particular amplitude and frequency. The required \u201cthrust-forces\u201d can be produced. We hypothesize that the direction and the speed of our hopper can be smoothly controlled by only changing the phase of the thrust-forces being applied to the ground, i.e., the change in phase between the leg-reconfiguration and the leg-oscillation. This is experimentally evaluated by varying the phase of leg-reconfiguration up-to the range of 0\u20132\u03c0 rad (0\u2013360 deg). Our results show a large region of a symmetric running. Moreover, a novel gait called \u201cin-place running1\u201d is found, where the speed of running is zero. We demonstrate that by only altering the phase of applying thrust-forces together with a constant leg oscillation can robustly control the speed and transition in the direction of locomotion.",

        "abstract": "Effective robot navigation in the presence of humans is hard. Not only do human obstacles move, they react to the movements of the robot according to instinct and social rules. In order to efficiently navigate around each other, both the robot and the human must move in a way that takes the other into account. Failure to do so can lead to a lowering of the perceived quality of the interaction and, more importantly, it can also delay one or both parties, causing them to be less efficient in whatever task they are trying to achieve. In this paper, we present a system capable of creating more efficient corridor navigation behaviors by manipulating existing navigation algorithms and introducing social cues from the robot to the human. We give the results of a user study, demonstrating the effectiveness of our system, and discuss how it can be applied more generally to a wide variety of situations.",

        "abstract": "Generating robot motion trajectories instantaneously in the moment unforeseen sensor events happen is very essential for many real-world robot applications. Using a previous work on online trajectory generation as a basis, this paper proposes an alternative approach that also considers dynamic models. The former class of algorithms does not take into account dynamically changing acceleration capabilities based on maximum actuator forces/torques. This paper extends target velocity-based algorithms of the previous approach by taking into consideration the entire system dynamics when generating trajectories online within one control cycle (typically 1 ms or less). The extension includes the acceleration capabilities of a robot at every discrete time step assuming constant values for the maximum actuator forces/torques, thus allowing the generation of adaptive trajectory profiles during the motion of the robot. Several real-world experimental results using a seven-degree-of-freedom lightweight robot arm underline the relevance of this extension.",

In nature, bacteria utilize chemical signaling to execute controlled movement, communication, and collaborative task completion. Chemotactic response (i.e. biased random walk of bacteria towards a chemo-attractant source) enables effective sensing and creates a biased distribution of bacteria in a field. Quorum sensing allows a robust collective response to be achieved at specific bacteria number densities. In this work, we present a computational model for bio-inspired sensing, communication, and control that is based on the combination of chemotaxis and quorum sensing. We have computationally demonstrated that these bio-inspired strategies can be implemented in synthetic mobile sensor network. Robustness and response time of such systems are also examined.",

This is achieved through a feature inference algorithm that enables computing the fusion of keywords which have never been presented to the robot together previously. In this sense, robot imagination is defined as the robot's capability of generating feature parameter values of unknown objects by generalizing characteristics from previously presented objects. The system is first trained with visual information paired with semantic object descriptions from which keywords are extracted. Each keyword creates an instance of the learnt object in an n-dimensional feature space. The core concept behind the robot imagination system presented in this paper is the use of statistically fit hyperplanes in the feature space to represent and simultaneously extend the meaning of grounded words. The inference algorithm allows to determine complete solutions in the feature space. Finally, evolutionary algorithms are used to return these numeric values to the real world, completing an inverse semantic process.",

        "abstract": "Tendril helical motions and snake robots have a multitude of potential applications from climbing to anchoring to complex manipulation in fields such as medical, gas/oil energy, and manufacturing. Constructing a snake robot from a fluid driven, fiber reinforced elastomeric enclosure (FREE), complex helical motions are created in a lightweight, low cost, simple structure. The snake-like manipulators are created by forming a hollow cylindrical elastomer that is reinforced with two families of fibers and one additional fiber. The manipulator is then driven by changing the volume of fluid contained within, thus forming the desired helical patterns. The design of this continuum structure is analyzed for all possible fiber angles and the FREE radius. The parameters of the resulting helix including pitch and radius are determined analytically, without the need for finite element methods. Three prototypes at different points in the design space are fabricated and tested to verify the analytical model.",

Due to its fast settling time and its robustness, this controller is suggested to be applied for the first time to control a R/W head of an HDD. To highlight the good performance and characteristics of the NMPC, a comparative study with a standard PID control is presented. The two control methodologies were evaluated in nominal conditions as well as in other situations such as disturbances and uncertainties on the plant model parameters. In all cases, NMPC presents much better simulation results in term of speed and robustness in the presence of unexpected perturbations and parameters' change.",

Our focus is dynamic ocean features such as fronts and plumes. To support strong networked-control designs, we first develop a clean linear time-invariant framework for tracking features, that directly couples the global structure of the process to vehicle positioning. To address the packet loss inherent in underwater acoustic communications, we then extend the synthesis technique of Imer et al. [1] to the case where measurements and control commands suffer loss with differing statistics among the multiple channels. Simulations show that the integrated feedback system achieves good performance in front tracking.",

        "abstract": "There are body-powered hooks and myoelectric prosthetic hands that trans-radial amputees can use for work. Though the body-powered hooks have good workability for complex operations, the design of the hook is unappealing and the harness is cumbersome. The myoelectric prosthetic hand has a natural appearance similar to the human hand and intuitive operability using a myoelectric control system. However, it is expensive and heavy. Because of these problems associated with prostheses for work, many amputees use cosmetic prostheses. In this paper, we report a lightweight, low-cost electric trans-radial prosthesis with three opposed fingers. A simple mechanism to control the fingers by a linear actuator contributes to its good workability, lightweight, and low-cost. An operation system using an inexpensive distance sensor allows intuitive operability equivalent to the myoelectric control system. A socket makes the prosthesis easily removable. The total weight of the hand and socket is 300 g, and both can be produced with a 3D printer. An evaluation using the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP) demonstrated that an amputee was able to operate abstract objects which require six types of grasps with the developed prosthesis.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of incrementally learning different strategies of performing a complex sequential task from multiple demonstrations of an expert or a set of experts. While the task is the same, each expert differs in his/her way of performing it. We assume that this variety across experts' demonstration is due to the fact that each expert/strategy is driven by a different reward function, where reward function is expressed as a linear combination of a set of known features. Consequently, we can learn all the expert strategies by forming a convex set of optimal deterministic policies, from which one can match any unseen expert strategy drawn from this set. Instead of learning from scratch every optimal policy in this set, the learner transfers knowledge from the set of learned policies to bootstrap its search for new optimal policy. We demonstrate our approach on a simulated mini-golf task where the 7 degrees of freedom Barrett WAM robot arm learns to sequentially putt on different holes in accordance with the playing strategies of the expert.",

        "abstract": "In nature, some animals exhibit impressive navigation capability using ambient magnetic field. Particularly, certain kinds of sea turtles can associate geomagnetism to spatial representation for positioning in transoceanic migration across the seemingly clueless sea. In robotics, the previous works on magnetic navigation can position a robot using ambient magnetic field, but they focused on an exploitation of extensively-explored magnetic map, i.e. the magnetic field of every inch of the region of interest is recorded for mapping. In this work, we propose an algorithm that is based on our analysis on how sea turtles navigate at sea under magnetic disruption as investigated and reported by biologists [1], [2]. We propose a direct likelihood method that generates pseudo training data to improve the estimation accuracy of the Gaussian mixture models. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that our localization algorithm exhibits stable and accurate positioning results. This work contrasts with the previous works which focused on magnetic localization using extensive data collection. On the contrary, we address whether magnetic localization is still feasible under scarce data samples and how to overcome this challenge.",

        "abstract": "Medical ultrasound imaging is a widespread highresolution (both spatial and temporal) method to gather live images of the interior of the human body. Its potential as a human-machine interface for the disabled - amputees in particular - is being explored in the rehabilitation robotics community. Following up the recent discovery that first-order spatial features of the ultrasound images of the human forearm are linearly related to the hand configuration, we hereby push the approach to a realistic scenario. We show that an extremely simple calibration procedure can be used to obtain a linear regression system which will effectively predict the forces required by a human subject at the fingertips, using live ultrasound images of the forearm. In particular, the system can be trained on minimum and maximum forces only, thereby dramatically shortening the calibration phase; and it will generalise to intermediate force values. This phenomenon is uniform across 5 intact subjects whom we examined in a controlled experiment. Moreover, it is not necessary to use any force sensor, as learning-by-imitation, namely using a visual stimulus, yields similar results. This result is particularly useful in the case of amputees, who normally cannot perform graded-force tasks as proprioception may be lost since decades. Applications of this system include, among others: advanced prosthetics, phantom pain therapy and smart teleoperation.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a new comprehensive solution for the open problem of uncalibrated 3D image-based stereo visual servoing for robot manipulators. One of the main contributions of this article is a novel 3D stereo camera model to map positions in the task space to positions in a new 3D Visual Cartesian Space (a visual feature space where 3D positions are measured in pixel). This model is used to compute a full-rank Image Jacobian Matrix (Jimg), which solves several common problems presented on the classical image Jacobians, e.g., image space singularities and local minima. This Jacobian is a fundamental key for the image-based control design, where uncalibrated stereo camera systems can be used to drive a robot manipulator. Furthermore, an adaptive second order sliding mode visual servo control is designed to track 3D visual motions using the 3D trajectory errors defined in the Visual Cartesian Space. The stability of the control in closed loop with a dynamic robot system is formally analyzed and proved, where exponential convergence of errors in the Visual Cartesian Space and task space without local minima are demonstrated. The complete control system is evaluated both in simulation and on a real industrial robot. The robustness of the control scheme is evaluated for cases where the extrinsic parameters of the stereo camera system change on-line and the kinematic/dynamic robot parameters are considered as unknown. This approach offers a proper solution for the common problem of visual occlusion, since the stereo system can be moved to obtain a clear view of the task at any time.",

Note that most deformation controllers in the literature require a-priori knowledge of the object's deformation properties. In contrast to this trend, we present a new Lyapunov-based method that online estimates the unknown deformation Jacobian matrix, avoiding any model identification or calibration steps. To achieve the desired object's deformation, we derive an innovative dynamic-state feedback velocity control law using the passivity-based framework. We present a detailed experimental study to validate the feasibility of our deformation controller.",

Specifically, a novel fundamental matrix-based algorithm is firstly proposed to rotate the robot to point toward the desired position, with the camera intrinsic parameters estimated simultaneously by employing the fundamental matrix and a projection homography matrix. Subsequently, by utilizing the obtained camera intrinsic parameters, a straight-line motion controller is developed to drive the robot to the desired position, with the orientation of the robot always facing the target position. Another pure rotation controller is finally adopted to correct the orientation error. The exponentially convergent properties of the visual servo errors are proven with mathematical analysis. The performance of the proposed uncalibrated visual servo regulation method is further validated by simulation results.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to acquire textured 3D models of objects without the need for sophisticated hardware infrastructures. The approach is inexpensive, using a low-cost Microsoft Kinect RGB-D sensor and Augmented Reality (AR) markers printed on paper sheets. The AR-markers can be freely placed in the scene, allowing the modeling of objects of various sizes, and the sensor can be moved by the hand of an untrained person. To generate usable models with this very inexpensive and simple setup, the sequence of RGB-D scans is embedded in a graph-based optimizer for automatic post-refinement. The main novelty of this contribution is the development of an uncertainty model for an AR-marker. The AR-marker uncertainty models are used as constraints in an optimization problem to better estimate the object pose. The models are in the end further fine-tuned by a standard point-based registration algorithm. The results section presents realistic models of various objects generated using this system, e.g., parcels, sport balls, human dolls etc. Additionally, a quantitative analysis is presented using objects of known dimensions.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel survey path planning technique which minimizes the robot's position uncertainty along the planned path while taking into account area coverage performance. The proposed technique especially targets bathymetric mapping applications and respects application constraints such as the desire to survey in parallel tracks and to avoid turns in the target area to maximize sonar measurements quality. While accounting for uncertainty in the survey planning process can lead to more accurate data products, existing survey planning tools typically ignore it. Our method bridges this gap using the saliency on an a priori map to predict how the terrain will affect the robot's belief at every point on the target area. Based on this magnitude, we provide an algorithm that computes the order in which to trace parallel tracks to cover the target area minimizing the overall uncertainty along the path. A particle filter keeps track of the robot's position uncertainty during the planning process and, in order to find useful loop-closures for mapping, crossing tracks that visit salient locations are added when the uncertainty surpasses a user-provided threshold. We test our method on real-world datasets collected off the coasts of Spain, Greece and Australia. We evaluate the expected robot's position uncertainty along the planned paths and assess their associated mapping performance using a bathymetric mapping algorithm. Results show that our method offers benefits over a standard lawnmower-type path both in terms of position uncertainty and map quality.",

This 1D+2D detector fuses 1D range scan and 2D image information via an effective geometric descriptor and a silhouette based visual representation within a radial basis function kernel support vector machine learning framework. Unlike the existing approaches, the proposed 1D+2D detector does not make any restrictive assumptions on the range scan positions, thus it is applicable to a wide range of real-life detection tasks. To analyze the discriminative power of the geometric descriptor, a range scan only version, 1D+, is also evaluated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the 1D+2D detector works robustly under challenging imaging conditions and achieves several orders of magnitude performance improvement while reducing the computational load drastically. In addition, a new multi-modal (LIDAR, depth image, optical image) dataset, DontHitMe, is introduced. This dataset contains 40,000 registered frames and 3,600 manually annotated human objects. It depicts challenging illumination conditions in indoors and outdoors environments and is publicly available to our community.",

The method generates dense, geometrically accurate reconstructions of underwater environments by compensating for image distortions due to refraction. A refractive model of the camera and enclosure is calculated offline using calibration images and produces non-linear epipolar curves for use in stereo matching. An efficient block matching algorithm traverses the precalculated epipolar curves to find pixel correspondences and depths are calculated using pixel ray tracing. Finally the depth maps are used to perform dense simultaneous localization and mapping to generate a 3D model of the environment. The localization and mapping algorithm incorporates refraction corrected ray tracing to improve map quality. The method is shown to improve overall depth map quality over existing methods and to generate high quality 3-D reconstructions.",

        "abstract": "In order to increase accuracy and robustness in state estimation for robotics, a growing number of applications rely on data from multiple complementary sensors. For the best performance in sensor fusion, these different sensors must be spatially and temporally registered with respect to each other. To this end, a number of approaches have been developed to estimate these system parameters in a two stage process, first estimating the time offset and subsequently solving for the spatial transformation between sensors. In this work, we present on a novel framework for jointly estimating the temporal offset between measurements of different sensors and their spatial displacements with respect to each other. The approach is enabled by continuous-time batch estimation and extends previous work by seamlessly incorporating time offsets within the rigorous theoretical framework of maximum likelihood estimation. Experimental results for a camera to inertial measurement unit (IMU) calibration prove the ability of this framework to accurately estimate time offsets up to a fraction of the smallest measurement period.",

We propose the use of FPGAs as a flexible solution to these low-level issues; We here address the hitherto unresolved issue of interfacing the FPGA-based controllers to high-level robotics software running on a PC. This paper presents the Unity-Link software-gateware stack, which connects high-level software frameworks to our modular, FPGA-based generic hardware. Unity-Link provides simple, unified abstractions for quickly and easily interconnecting PC-based systems with nodes that provide hard real-time control of distributed robotic systems. Unity-Link uses a component-based modular bus structure based on open standards, and interfaces with a library of gateware components, enabling us to create complex applications quickly and efficiently. Automated code generation is used to provide convenient, application-specific interfaces to high-level robotics middleware such as ROS.",

        "abstract": "While inexpensive depth sensors are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, field of view and self-occlusion constraints limit the information a single sensor can provide. For many applications one may instead require a network of depth sensors, registered to a common world frame and synchronized in time. Historically such a setup has required a tedious manual calibration procedure, making it infeasible to deploy these networks in the wild, where spatial and temporal drift are common. In this work, we propose an entirely unsupervised procedure for calibrating the relative pose and time offsets of a pair of depth sensors. So doing, we make no use of an explicit calibration target, or any intentional activity on the part of a user. Rather, we use the unstructured motion of objects in the scene to find potential correspondences between the sensor pair. This yields a rough transform which is then refined with an occlusion-aware energy minimization. We compare our results against the standard checkerboard technique, and provide qualitative examples for scenes in which such a technique would be impossible.",

        "abstract": "We present a principled solution to the problem of transferring grasps across objects. Our approach identifies, through autonomous exploration, the size and shape of object parts that consistently predict the applicability of a grasp across multiple objects. The robot can then use these parts to plan grasps onto novel objects. By contrast to most recent methods, we aim to solve the part-learning problem without the help of a human teacher. The robot collects training data autonomously by exploring different grasps on its own. The core principle of our approach is an intensive encoding of low-level sensorimotor uncertainty with probabilistic models, which allows the robot to generalize the noisy autonomously-generated grasps. Object shape, which is our main cue for predicting grasps, is encoded with surface densities, that model the spatial distribution of points that belong to an object's surface. Grasp parameters are modeled with grasp densities, that correspond to the spatial distribution of object-relative gripper poses that lead to a grasp. The size and shape of grasp-predicting parts are identified by sampling the cross-object correlation of local shape and grasp parameters. We approximate sampling and integrals via Monte Carlo methods to make our computer implementation tractable. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in simulation. A proof of concept on a real robot is also provided.",

Based on the radar propagating principle and the proposed algorithm, the vibration status of robot arm can be obtained. Besides, the vibration status can be reduced by feedback the information to the controller of the robot arm. The advantage of the proposed sensor is that without contacting to the robot arm, UWB sensor is more flexible to be used and will not cause any unnecessary payload as accelerometers. With proper calibration, the simulation of vibration frequency and the real-time absolute position of the robot arm were calculated and demonstrated. The experimental results show that the correlations for measured frequency and distance approximate to 1.",

Based on the concept of distributed representation, a non-parametric action-mixture model is proposed in the system to represent high-dimensional human-pose space using low-dimensional manifolds in searching human poses. In each manifold, the probability distribution is estimated by the similarity of features. The distributions in the manifolds are then redistributed according to the stationary distribution of a Markov chain that models the frequency of actions. After the redistribution, the manifolds are combined according to the distribution determined by the action classification. In addition, the spatial relationship between human-body parts is explicitly modeled by a kinematic chain. Computer-simulation results showed that multiple low-dimensional manifolds can represent human-pose space. The 3D-point-cloud system showed reduction of the overall error and standard deviation compared with other approaches without using action classification.",

Sensing physical parameters in microfluidic environments has strongly been demanded in various lab-on-a-chip applications as well. In this paper, we propose mobile microrobots as mobile sensor in microfluidics. We develop an original environment for highresolution dynamic tracking and analysis in microfluidic chips. Studying robot dynamics in low Reynolds fluid with no magnetic sensor in the chip is challenging as the field distribution and robot magnetization are not well known. Our intended goal is to explore intrinsic magneto-fluidic sensing capacities to collect more information on the microsystem. We successfully integrate our robot into a transparent microfluidic chip for high-temporal resolution analysis of dynamics. We develop an electromagnetic setup allowing complete remote control (at low power) of rotational behaviour. We study a breakdown phenomenon up to 1kHz signal and develop a scalar method analyzing rotational dynamics to enhance their sensing capacity.",

        "abstract": "We proposed a method for estimating sound source locations in a 3D space by integrating sound directions estimated by multiple microphone arrays and taking advantage of reflection information. Two types of sources with different directivity properties (human speech and loudspeaker speech) were evaluated for different positions and orientations. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of using reflection information, depending on the position and orientation of the sound sources relative to the array, walls, and the source type. The use of reflection information increased the source position detection rates by 10% on average and up to 60% for the best case.",

        "abstract": "We present a methodology for enabling service robots to follow natural language commands from non-expert users, with and without user-specified constraints, with a particular focus on spatial language understanding. As part of our approach, we propose a novel extension to the semantic field model of spatial prepositions that enables the representation of dynamic spatial relations involving paths. The design, system modules, and implementation details of our robot software architecture are presented and the relevance of the proposed methodology to interactive instruction and task modification through the addition of constraints is discussed. The paper concludes with an evaluation of our robot software architecture implemented on a simulated mobile robot operating in both a 2D home environment and in real world environment maps to demonstrate the generalizability and usefulness of our approach in real world applications.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for detecting moving entities that are in the robot's path but not in the field of view of sensors like laser scanners, cameras or ultrasonic sensors. The proposed system makes use of passive acoustic localization methods which receive information from occluded regions (at intersections or corners) because of the multipath nature of sound propagation. Contrary to the conventional sensors, this method does not require line of sight. In particular, specular reflections in the environment make it possible to detect moving entities that emit sound such as a walking person or a rolling cart. This idea was exploited for safe navigation of a mobile platform at intersections. The passive acoustic localization output is combined with a 3D geometric map of the environment that is precise enough to estimate sound propagation and reflection using ray casting methods. This gives the robot the ability to detect a moving entity out of the field of view of the sensors that require line of sight. Then the robot is able to recalculate its path and waits until the detected entity is out of its path so that it is safe to move to its destination. To illustrate the performance of the proposed method, a comparison of the robot's navigation with and without the audio sensing is provided for several intersection scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Tactile sensations make grasping fragile objects a simple and unchallenging task for the human hand. Prosthetic hands lack these sensory capabilities and their users frequently struggle with such tasks. To address this problem, the benefits of compliant fingertips with contact-detection reflexes were assessed in one prosthesis user when grasping fragile objects (eggshells, foam packing peanuts, crackers, and soft clay). A commercially available myoelectric prosthetic hand was modified to include the compliant BioTac\u00ae tactile sensors (SynTouch, LLC), which have previously been demonstrated to be more sensitive to contact than the human fingertip. Upon sensing contact during hand closure on an object, the gain of the operator's EMG command signals to the prosthesis' motor was reduced to prevent excessive closing forces, a behavior similar to an inhibitory reflex. This allowed the prosthetic hand to quickly react to the presence of the object and permitted the operator to handle fragile objects with ease and without the usual dependency on visual feedback. The time required to grasp and move a set of fragile objects with this modified prosthesis was compared to the subject's usual prosthetic hand. The contact detection method demonstrated both utility and reliability through faster completion times and reduced variance in the times to complete these trials.",

This renders simulations and simulation models more accessible to a general-public, by reducing the simulation model deployment complexity. It also increases productivity by offering built-in and ready-to-use functionalities, as well as a multitude of programming approaches.

To enable such novel characteristics our method embeds samples generated in the configuration space into a simple l2 norm space by using pivot points. We then implicitly define Voronoi regions and use local LSHs with varying quantization factors for those Voronoi regions. We have applied our method and other prior techniques to high-dimensional motion planning problems. Our method is able to show performance improvement by a factor of up to three times even with higher accuracy over prior, approximate nearest neighbor search techniques.",

To obtain high-speed motion, it is necessary to increase the actuator output as the robot weight increases. In contrast, humans perform motions using instantaneous force, such as jumping or throwing, via variable stiffness characteristics. We have developed a one-degree-of-freedom manipulator with a variable rheological joint using a straight-fiber-type artificial muscle and a magnetorheological (MR) brake. With the generation of instantaneous force, the dead and rise times decreased compared to the conventional method. After the generation of an arbitrary instantaneous force, we were able to control the robot's arm position by applying an equilibrium force on the joint. Furthermore, we were able to control the vibrations of the arm by controlling the MR brake using an evaluation function.",

We aim to reduce the vascular load through extracting and vibrating action as actually applied by operators. In order to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct an evaluation experiment where a wire is inserted in a tube that simulates a blood vessel. As a result of the experiment we were able to estimate the force on the contact points with an accuracy of an estimation error of 9.1%. Moreover, through vibration control we were able to reduce the load to below 0.1[N] for places where there was an overload of more than 0.5[N]. For vibration control, the experiment also enabled us to derive an effective parameter adjustment method to remove obstructions.",

We propose a new cooperative fusion method between two exteroceptive sensors: it is able to address highly non linear dynamic configuration without any assumption on the driving maneuver. Information are provided by a mono-layer laser scanner and a monocular camera which are unsynchronized. The initial detection stage is performed using the 1D laser data, which computes clusters of points which might correspond to vehicles present on the road. These clusters are projected to the image to define targets, which will be tracked using image registration techniques. This multi-object association and tracking scheme is implemented using belief theory integrating temporal and spatial information, which allows the estimation of the dynamic state of the tracks and to monitor appearance and disappearance of obstacles. Accuracy of the method is evaluated on a database made publicly available, focus is cast on the relative localization of the vehicle ahead: estimations of its longitudinal and lateral distances are analysed.",

        "abstract": "Predicting other traffic participants trajectories is a crucial task for an autonomous vehicle, in order to avoid collisions on its planned trajectory. It is also necessary for many Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, where the ego-vehicle's trajectory has to be predicted too. Even if trajectory prediction is not a deterministic task, it is possible to point out the most likely trajectory. This paper presents a new trajectory prediction method which combines a trajectory prediction based on Constant Yaw Rate and Acceleration motion model and a trajectory prediction based on maneuver recognition. It takes benefit on the accuracy of both predictions respectively a short-term and long-term. The defined Maneuver Recognition Module selects the current maneuver from a predefined set by comparing the center lines of the road's lanes to a local curvilinear model of the path of the vehicle. The overall approach was tested on prerecorded human real driving data and results show that the Maneuver Recognition Module has a high success rate and that the final trajectory prediction has a better accuracy.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses a vibration suppression control method for a space robot with a rigid manipulator and flexible appendage. A suitable dynamic model that considers the coupling between the manipulator and flexible appendage was developed for the controller to accomplish the vibration suppression control of the flexible appendage. The flexible appendage was modeled using a virtual joint model, and the control method was developed on the basis of this model. Although this type of control requires feedback of the flexible appendage state, its direct measurement is generally difficult. Thus, an estimator of the flexible appendage state was constructed using a force/torque sensor attached between the base and flexible appendage. The control method was experimentally verified using an air-floating system.",

        "abstract": "This article presents a novel algorithm for multiple odor source localization by a multi-robot system based on a virtual cancelation plume approach. The proposed method is based on rendering a previously declared odor source invisible to the robots so that the declared source and the odor plume it generates do not interfere with the effects of other existing plumes, allowing the localization of the remaining sources. Exploration and plume tracking by the robots is achieved using a decentralized asynchronous particle swarm optimization algorithm. The divergence operator is used to declare the odor sources. A set of simulations and real world experiments are performed on two different scenarios on a controlled environment using a swarm of 5 robots to validate the proposed methodology. Results show that the virtual plume cancelation algorithm can be successfully used to find multiple odor sources, even when two plumes overlap. It can also extend the operation of many odor source localization algorithms developed for single source localization.",

        "abstract": "All mammals but humans use whiskers in order to rapidly acquire information about objects in the vicinity of the head. Collisions of the head and objects can be avoided as the contact point is moved from the body surface to the whiskers. Such a behavior is also highly desirable during many robot tasks such as for human-robot interaction. Using novel capacitive proximity sensors, robots sense when they approach a human (or an object) and react before they actually collide with it. We propose a sensor and control concept that mimics the behavior of whiskers by means of capacitive sensors. Major advantages are the absence of physical whiskers, the absence of blind spots and a very short response time. The sensors are flexible and thin so that they feature skin-like properties and can be attached to various robotic link and joint shapes. In comparison to capacitive proximity sensors, the proposed virtual whiskers offer better sensitivity towards small conductive as well as non conductive objects. Equipped with the new proximity sensors, a seven-joint robot for humanrobot interaction tasks shows the efficiency and responsiveness of our concept.",

It allows detecting a runway under different weather conditions even if only a small part is visible in the image. In order to increase landing reliability under sub-optimal wind conditions, an additional loop was introduced into the altitude controller. All control and image processing is performed onboard. The system has been successfully tested in flight experiments with two different fixed wing platforms at various weather conditions, in summer, fall and winter.",

If work progress continues, deformation of the part increases, humans check the deformation and adjust force corresponding to the progress state. The proposed method enables a robot manipulator to adjust force applied for assembly work like a human. In our proposed method, force applied for the work is generated by visual information from a camera reading the deformation of the parts. Processing the visual information quantifies the deformation and the data show the work progress. NCC is generally used for template matching, but in this paper we use it for quantifying deformation. Connectors are assembled by a robot manipulator using proposed method and impedance control in experiments. Experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a vision-based localization and mapping algorithm for an autonomous mower. We divide the task for robotic mowing into two separate phases, a teaching phase and a mowing phase. During the teaching phase, the mower estimates the 3D positions of landmarks and defines a boundary in the lawn with an estimate of its own trajectory. During the mowing phase, the location of the mower is estimated using the landmark and boundary map acquired from the teaching phase. Of particular interest for our work is ensuring that the estimator for landmark mapping will not fail due to the nonlinearity of the system during the teaching phase. A nonlinear observer is designed with pseudo-measurements of each landmark's depth to prevent the map estimator from diverging. Simultaneously, the boundary is estimated with an EKF. Measurements taken from an omnidirectional camera, an IMU, and a ground speed sensor are used for the estimation. Numerical simulations and offline teaching phase experiments with our autonomous mower demonstrate the potential of our algorithm.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a mapping and navigation system for a mobile robot, which uses vision as its sole sensor modality. The system enables the robot to navigate autonomously, plan paths and avoid obstacles using a vision based topometric map of its environment. The map consists of a globally-consistent pose-graph with a local 3D point cloud attached to each of its nodes. These point clouds are used for direction independent loop closure and to dynamically generate 2D metric maps for locally optimal path planning. Using this locally semi-continuous metric space, the robot performs shortest path planning instead of following the nodes of the graph \u2014 as is done with most other vision-only navigation approaches. The system exploits the local accuracy of visual odometry in creating local metric maps, and uses pose graph SLAM, visual appearance-based place recognition and point clouds registration to create the topometric map. The ability of the framework to sustain vision-only navigation is validated experimentally, and the system is provided as open-source software.",

Sensor fusion algorithms are generally used to achieve an accurate estimation of the vehicle motion by combining heterogeneous sensors measurements with different statistical characteristics. In this paper, a new method that combines measurements provided by an inertial sensor and a vision system is presented. Compared to classical modelbased techniques, the method relies on a Pareto optimization that trades off the statistical properties of the measurements. The proposed technique is evaluated with simulations in terms of computational requirements and estimation accuracy with respect to a classical Kalman filter approach. It is shown that the proposed method gives an improved estimation accuracy at the cost of a slightly increased computational complexity.",

        "abstract": "Visual localization in crowded dynamic environments requires information about static and dynamic objects. This paper presents a robust method that learns the useful features from multiple runs in highly crowded urban environments. Useful features are identified as distinctive ones that are also reliable to extract in diverse imaging conditions. Relative importance of features is used to derive the weight for each feature. The popular Bag-of-words model is used for image retrieval and localization, where query image is the current view of the environment and database contains the visual experience from previous runs. Based on the reliability, features are augmented and eliminated over runs. This reduces the size of representation, and makes it more reliable in crowded scenes. We tested the proposed method on data sets collected from highly crowded Indian urban outdoor settings. Experiments have shown that with the help of a small subset (10%) of the detected features, we can reliably localize the camera. We achieve superior results in terms of localization accuracy even when more than 90% of the pixels are occluded or dynamic.",

        "abstract": "Aim at enhancing dexterous and safe operation in unstructured environment, a cable-driven soft robotic manipulator is designed in this paper. Due to soft material it made of and nearly infinite degree of freedom it owns, the soft robotic manipulator has higher security and dexterity than traditional rigid-link manipulator, which make it suitable to perform tasks in complex environments that is narrow, confined and unstructured. Though the soft robotic manipulator possesses advantages above, it is not an easy thing for it to achieve precise position control. In order to solve this problem, a kinematic model based on piecewise constant curvature hypothesis is proposed. Through building up three spaces and two mappings, the relationship between the length variables of 4 cables and the position and orientation of the soft robotic manipulator end-effector is obtained. Afterwards, a depth-independent image Jacobian matrix is introduced and an image-based visual servo controller is presented. Applied by adaptive algorithm, the controller could estimate unknown position of the feature point online, and then Lyapunov theory is used to prove the stability of the proposed controller. At last, experiments are conducted to demonstrate rationality and validity of the kinematic model and adaptive visual servo controller.",

This article presents a method for UAV visual servoing that uses the 3D pose of the drone as controller feedback. A remote monocular camera observes the tracked UAV while it moves and rotates in a 3D space. Pose is obtained from a 3D tracking process based on a cuboid model. In particular, a simultaneous face tracking strategy where 3D pose estimations from different faces are combined is introduced. Face combination was validated using a robotic arm with a cuboid at the final joint. For the UAV control, hover and path following tasks were tested. Results show that the proposed method correctly handles changes in pose, even though no face is always visible. Also, the UAV maintained a low speed in order to satisfy the small inter-frame displacement constraint imposed by visual tracking algorithm.",

In this paper, a new, fast and direct method of autofocusing has been presented based on the idea of traditional visual servoing to control the focus step using an adaptive gain. The visual control law is validated using a normalized variance sharpness function. The obtained experimental results demonstrate the performance of the proposed autofocusing method in terms of accuracy, speed and robustness.",

Localization for the controller is provided by an on-board, vision-based mapping and navigation system enabling operation in large-scale, GPS-denied, extreme environments. The paper presents experimental results including over 600 m of travel by a four-wheeled, 50 kg robot travelling through challenging terrain including steep hills and sandy turns and by a six-wheeled, 160 kg robot at gradually-increased speeds up to three times faster than the nominal, safe speed. In the absence of a global localization system, ILC is demonstrated to reduce path-tracking errors caused by unmodelled robot dynamics and terrain challenges.",

        "abstract": "This paper provides two novel contributions. The former regards the observability of the visual-inertial structure from motion. It is proven that, the information contained in the data provided by a monocular camera which observes a single point-feature and by an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) allows estimating the absolute scale, the speed in the local frame, the absolute roll and pitch angles, the biases which affect the accelerometer's and the gyroscope's measurements, the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration and the extrinsic camera-IMU calibration. The latter contribution is the derivation of a new closed form solution to determine some of the previous observable quantities by only using few camera measurements collected during a short time interval and the data provided by the IMU during the same time interval. This closed-solution allows us to investigate the intrinsic properties of the visual-inertial structure from motion and in particular to identify the conditions under which the problem has a finite number of solutions. Specifically, it is shown that the problem can have a unique solution, two distinct solutions and infinite solutions depending on the trajectory, on the number of point-features and on their layout and on the number of camera images. The proposed closed solution is finally used in conjunction with a filter based approach in order to show its benefit.",

Unlike most existing learning from demonstration approaches, where the focus is placed on the trajectories, in our approach the focus is on achieving a desired goal configuration of objects relative to one another. Our approach is based on visual perception which captures the object's context for each demonstrated action. This context is the basis of the visuospatial representation and encodes implicitly the relative positioning of the object with respect to multiple other objects simultaneously. The proposed approach is capable of learning and generalizing multi-operation skills from a single demonstration, while requiring minimum a priori knowledge about the environment. The learned skills comprise a sequence of operations that aim to achieve the desired goal configuration using the given objects. We illustrate the capabilities of our approach using three object reconfiguration tasks with a Barrett WAM robot.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We present variable negative stiffness actuation (VnSA), an alternative method of achieving variable stiffness actuation based on the nonlinear deflection characteristics of buckling beams. The approach exploits transverse stiffness variations of axially loaded beams around their critical buckling load to achieve an actuator with adjustable stiffness. In particular, transverse stiffness of buckled beams are positive under tensile loading and for compressive loading below their first critical buckling load, while they display negative stiffness above this critical value. Furthermore, for small deflections transverse stiffness of buckled beams depends linearly on the amount of axial loading. Consequently, the stiffness of a variable stiffness actuator can be modulated (i) by decreasing the transverse stiffness through an increase of the axial compressive loading on a beam, up to values above the first critical buckling load where the overall stiffness of the actuator approaches its lowest negative value, and (ii) by increasing the transverse stiffness through application of tensile axial loading. Capitalizing on the concept of negative stiffness, the lowest stiffness of VnSA can be set arbitrarily close to zero or even to negative values (when counterbalanced), while very high stiffness values are also achievable by tensile loading of the beam. As a result, VnSA can modulate its stiffness over a uniquely large range that includes zero and negative stiffness values. Furthermore, thanks to the negative stiffness characteristics, the stiffness of VnSA can be kept very low without sacrificing the mechanical integrity and load bearing capacity of the actuator. We introduce the design of VnSA, theoretically analyze its stiffness modulation response, and provide implementation details of a prototype. We also provide experimental results detailing range of stiffness modulation and force tracking performance achieved with this prototype and discuss its correspondence with the ... Show More",

        "abstract": "Conversion of unorganized point clouds to surface reconstructions is increasingly required in the mobile robotics perception processing pipeline, particularly with the rapid adoption of RGB-D (color and depth) image sensors. Many contemporary methods stem from the work in the computer graphics community in order to handle the point clouds generated by tabletop scanners in a batch-like manner. The requirements for mobile robotics are different and include support for real-time processing, incremental update, localization, mapping, path planning, obstacle avoidance, ray-tracing, terrain traversability assessment, grasping/manipulation and visualization for effective human-robot interaction. We carry out a quantitative comparison of Greedy Projection and Marching cubes along with our voxel planes method. The execution speed, error, compression and visualization appearance of these are assessed. Our voxel planes approach first computes the PCA over the points inside a voxel, combining these PCA results across 2\u00d72\u00d72 voxel neighborhoods in a sliding window. Second, the smallest eigenvector and voxel centroid define a plane which is intersected with the voxel to reconstruct the surface patch (3-6 sided convex polygon) within that voxel. By nature of their construction these surface patches tessellate to produce a surface representation of the underlying points. In experiments on public datasets the voxel planes method is 3 times faster than marching cubes, offers 300 times better compression than Greedy Projection, 10 fold lower error than marching cubes whilst allowing incremental map updates.",

        "abstract": "Crafting a proper assistance policy is a difficult endeavour but essential for the development of robotic assistants. Indeed, assistance is a complex issue that depends not only on the task-at-hand, but also on the state of the user, environment and competing objectives. As a way forward, this paper proposes learning the task of assistance through observation; an approach we term Learning Assistance by Demonstration (LAD). Our methodology is a subclass of Learning-by-Demonstration (LbD), yet directly addresses difficult issues associated with proper assistance such as when and how to appropriately assist. To learn assistive policies, we develop a probabilistic model that explicitly captures these elements and provide efficient, online, training methods. Experimental results on smart mobility assistance - using both simulation and a real-world smart wheelchair platform - demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach; the LAD model quickly learns when to assist (achieving an AUC score of 0.95 after only one demonstration) and improves with additional examples. Results show that this translates into better task-performance; our LAD-enabled smart wheelchair improved participant driving performance (measured in lap seconds) by 20.6s (a speedup of 137%), after a single teacher demonstration.",

In order to effectively adapt to this, robots need the ability to reason along multiple dimensions at execution time. We propose an approach to closed-loop planning capable of generating configuration plans, i.e., action plans for multirobot systems which specify the causal, temporal, resource and information dependencies between individual sensing, computation, and actuation components. The key feature which enables closed loop performance is that configuration plans are represented as constraint networks, which are shared between the planner and the executor and are continuously updated during execution. We report experiments run both in simulation and on real robots, in which a fault in one robot is compensated through different types of plan modifications at run time.",

When the minimum distance between a human and a robot is too short, it can be naturally considered that the probability of a collision increases. Therefore, we consider that the robot should increase the distance to the human when the human is getting closer. We propose Withdrawal strategy as a method that aims to increase the distance by moving the end-effector not only away from the human but also to a parking position that can be previously assessed to be safer. To withdraw the end-effector, we use a virtual force model consisting of two virtual forces: a repelling force exerted by the human and an attractive force exerted by the parking position. We carry out experiments using a human-sized humanoid robot and five human subjects, and report the task completion time to evaluate the efficiency of the robot when performing a simple task.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the performance of distributed control algorithms for networked robotic systems when one or more robots fail to execute the optimal policy. In particular, we investigate the performance of the circumcenter algorithm with connectivity maintenance [1]-[3] when one or more adversarial agents act maliciously to maximally disrupt convergence of the remaining, cooperative agents. To this end, we formulate a performance objective for each adversary node in terms of the circumradii of its cooperative neighbors in a communication graph which does not require omniscience of adversaries as is often assumed in the literature (e.g., [4], [5]). We provide an optimization algorithm based on finite-horizon dynamic programming, and obtain solutions through numerical simulation. Our results show that in general adversarial nodes are able not only to impede convergence toward consensus, but can also affect global changes in the topology of the communication graph for the cooperative agents.",

        "abstract": "The navigation of a miniature aerial vehicle (MAV) in GPS-denied environments requires a robust embedded visual localization method. In this paper, we describe a simple but efficient stereo visual odometry algorithm, called eVO, running onboard our quadricopter MAV at video-rate. The proposed eVO algorithm relies on a keyframe scheme which allows to decrease the estimation drift and to reduce the computational cost. We study quantitatively the influence of the main parameters of the algorithm and tune them for optimal performance on various datasets. The eVO algorithm has been submitted to the KITTI odometry benchmark [1] where it ranks first at the date of submission, with an average translational drift of 1.93% and an average angular drift of less than 0.076 degres/m. Besides, we have made several experiments with our MAV with egolocalization given by eVO, for instance for autonomous 3D environment modeling.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an \u201canti-fatigue\u201d control method for bionic actuated systems. Specifically, the proposed method is illustrated on an over-actuated bionic arm. Our control method consists of two steps. In the first step, a set of linear equations is derived by connecting the acceleration description in both joint and muscle space. The pseudo inverse solution to these equations provides an initial optimal muscle force distribution. As a second step, we derive a gradient direction for muscle force redistribution. This allows the muscles to satisfy force constraints and generate an even distribution of forces throughout all the muscles (i.e. towards \"anti-fatigue\"). The overall proposed method is tested for a bending-stretching movement. We used two models (bionic arm with 6 and 10 muscles) to verify the method. The force distribution analysis verifies the \u201canti-fatigue\u201d property of the computed muscle force. The efficiency comparison shows that the computational time does not increase significantly with the increase of muscle number. The tracking error statistics of the two models show the validity of the method.",

We evaluate two different methods of detecting which robots are intended by the user, and show that an iterated election performs well in our setting. We also show that teams can be modified by adding and removing individual robots: \u201cAnd you. Not you\u201d. The success of the system is examined for different spatial configurations of robots with respect to each other and the user to find the proper workspace of selection methods.",
