        "abstract": "The work described in this paper explores a new solution for tracking multiple and dynamic objects in complex environments. An XPF (extended particle filter) is used to implement a multimodal distribution that represents the most probable estimation for each object position and velocity. A standard PF (particle filter) cannot be used with a variable number of obstacles; some other solutions have been tested in different previous works, but most of them require heavy computational resources at least for a high number of obstacles to be tracked. The solution described here includes a clustering procedure that increases the robustness of the probabilistic process in order to provide on-line adaptation to the variable number of clusters. The result is the XPFCP: extended particle filter with clustering process. The presented algorithm has been tested using stereovision measurements; the results included in the paper show the efficiency of the proposed system.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present how the 2 1/2 D visual servoing scheme can be used with omnidirectional cameras. Motivated by the growing interest for omnidirectional sensors on robotic applications and particularly on vision-based control, we extend this framework to the entire class of central catadioptric systems. Indeed, conventional cameras suffer from restricted field of view. Central catadioptric systems have larger fields of view thus overcoming the visibility problem encountered when using conventional cameras. The 2 1/2 D visual servoing is based on the estimation of the partial camera displacement between two views, given by the current and desired images. Geometrical relationships are exploited to enable a partial Euclidean reconstruction by decoupling the interaction between translation and rotation components of a homography matrix. First we describe how to obtain a generic homography matrix for central catadioptric cameras from the projection model of an entire class of camera. Then the information obtained from the homography is used to develop a 2 1/2 D visual servoing scheme.",

The proposed method describes robot dynamics by use of a 3D inverted pendulum model and applies passive dynamic autonomous control (PDAC) to it. By utilizing the polar coordinate system to express the robot state around the contact-point between robot and the ground and applying PDAC, it is possible to express the 3-dimensional dynamics as 1-dimensional autonomous system. Due to autonomy, this 1D dynamics has the conservative quantity named PDAC constant. We build the stabilizing controller by means of PDAC constant and analyze the walking based on the 1D dynamics. Finally the proposed method is tested by experiment.",

By using GPR, we could extract the buried object signals from a raw underground data of GPR. In addition, we could create a high resolution underground image which focuses on buried objects. The extraction of buried object signals from raw GPR data is achieved by using two methods which are a feature extraction processing method of underground image and a ground adaptive manipulation method which manipulates the sensor head of GPR along a ground surface. Moreover, we propose novel synthetic aperture radar processing, which could be applied to an uneven ground surface of a minefield, for detecting the landmine clearly. The high resolution underground image is obtained by the proposed synthetic aperture radar processing which is referred to as ground adaptive synthetic aperture radar algorithm. We developed a landmine detection robot, in which the proposed methods were implemented. To evaluate the proposed methods, experiments concerning landmine detection are done and experimental results illustrate the validity of the system.",

Moreover, in order to use the robot in object carrying search and rescue (SAR) applications, a grasping scheme of desired objects is added to the abilities of the controller. Behavior-based approach is also incorporated by \"target reaching\", \"link following\", \"obstacle avoidance\" and \"object grasping\" behaviors. Each link of the robot is separately controlled and able to select a behavior at any time. Behaviors are all realized as fuzzy actor critic learning (FACL) controllers (Jouffe, 1998). In order to move the robot in between different configurations and take dynamics into account, an online optimization technique based on genetic algorithms is employed.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports a case study of using single 3D stereoscopic visual feedback for real-time teleoperation of dexterous tasks. In traditional teleoperation systems, real-time visual feedbacks of multiple monoscopic views of the robot workspace are provided for remote operator. However, it is difficult for the operator to control remote robot to perform dexterous tasks by looking at multiple video feedbacks at the same time. During teleoperation, remote operators usually find multiple 2D visual feedbacks confusing, especially when performing dexterous tasks that require accurate positioning and orientating of robot end-effectors. In this paper, we propose to provide single real-time 3D stereoscopic visual feedback for remote operators so that they perceive remote robot workspace with the sense of depth. This sense of 3D empowers remote operators to accurately position and orient robot end-effector with confidence. Experiments have been conducted to reveal the usefulness of real-time 3D stereoscopic video feedback over multiple monoscopic video feedback in real-time teleoperation.",

We also describe a method for target localization in real-world coordinates which allows for sequential incorporation of measurements from multiple cameras into a single target's state vector. Additionally, a fast implementation of a false-positive reduction method for the foreground pixel masks is developed. Finally, a low-overhead collision prediction algorithm using the time-as-axis paradigm is presented. The proposed system was able to perform in real-time on videos of quarter-VGA (320/spl times/240) resolution.

        "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to evaluate the performance of our proposed art gallery-based roadmap algorithm against well-known and frequently cited visibility-based motion planning algorithms: the visibility graph and the visibility-based probabilistic roadmap. The comparison involves several criteria among which are: the cardinality of the graph, the completeness of the algorithm, coverage and connectivity of the free configuration space (CS/sub free/) and computational cost. Our proposed algorithm is robust and fast as it generally covers the whole CS/sub free/, based on the well-known art gallery theorem. It efficiently seeks to construct a roadmap that contains the smallest possible number of nodes (called guards) as opposed to generating a large number of nodes when compared to other motion planning approaches. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms both algorithms and proves to not only combine the attractive features of both algorithms but also eliminate the drawbacks of each one.",

Different spatial motion constraints for human machine collaborative systems can be implemented by using this method if we know the required geometric constraints and the instantaneous kinematics of the robot. It is independent of manipulator types: teleoperative or cooperative controlled; admittance or impedance type. Our method uses weighted, linearized, multi-objective optimization framework to formalize a library of virtual fixtures for task primitives. We set the cost function based on the user's inputs, and set linearized subject function based on a combination of five basic geometric constraints. In this paper, we also illustrate the implementation for two sample tasks, which are useful for surgical applications, and provide the experimental results for these tasks.",

The existence of time-varying communication delay and possibility of data packets dropouts are taken into consideration. Since significant data dropouts may result in discontinuity of the reference trajectory transmitted through the communication channel, the proposed control scheme includes a filter that provides a smooth approximation of a possibly discontinuous reference trajectory. The stability of the overall system is guaranteed by a version of the IOS small gain theorem for functional-differential equations. It is also shown that, in the case of reliable communication protocols, the proposed scheme guarantees that the slave manipulator tracks the delayed trajectory of the master with a prescribed small error.",

A gripper mechanism is mounted on the tool for grasping and manipulating objects. The design of the tool specifically focused on the demonstration of compliant motion task, with applications in manipulation and assembly tasks. The calibration approach first uses an extended Kalman Filter to convert the measured positions of three to twelve visible LED's into the pose of the tool frame relative to the Krypton camera frame. Then, using a non minimal state Kalman filter, the force sensor calibration parameters are calculated, and the orientation of the Krypton camera frame relative to the world frame is defined. This calibration approach is verified in a real world experiment.",

This is accomplished by comparing the dynamic performance of a cable-driven hexapod to that of a more conventional design in which the actuators are mounted at the joints. By integrating the actuators into the torso and through the use of cable transmission, the mass and inertias of the legs are reduced in order to attain the high accelerations and backdrivability. The dynamic performance described herein is bounded by the actuator torque limits and the no-slip condition at the ground contact points. The result is a description of how well each hexapod can accelerate its torso without causing slippage at the ground contact points. Although somewhat mixed, the results show some advantage to the use of a cable-driven transmission.",

The first one employs principal component analysis for feature selection and support vector machine for classification of human behaviors. The proposed feature selection method is based on the border information of four consecutive blobs. The second approach computes optical flow to obtain the velocity of each pixel for determining whether a human behavior is normal or not. Both algorithms are successfully implemented in crowded environments for detecting the human abnormal behaviors, such as (1) running people in a crowded environment, (2) bending down movement while most are walking or standing, (3) a person carrying a long bar and (4) a person waving hand in the crowd. Experimental results demonstrate the two methods proposed are robust and efficient in detecting human abnormal behaviors.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a new compact bending and disposable (to avoid nosocomial contaminations) plastic wrist for minimally invasive surgery with a large free space for several connections such as electrical wires, fiberoptics and fluidic tubes, etc. It uses small partially locked ball joints to increase the dexterity of surgical tools in all directions contrary to other wrists using several successive orthogonal joints. This compact wrist is a generic concept comprises at least two vertebrae composed of non-attached contacts: plastic plates and balls. Six metal wires drive the position of each vertebra and several other free wires allow the locking of wrist axial rotations. Analytic and finite element simulations allow an evaluation of the mechanical rigidity of the wrist by several parameters: the wire number, diameter, position, mechanical properties and the general geometry of the wrist. The wrist is fabricated with 6 mm biocompatible plastic vertebrae micromachined by low cost water jet cutting. It uses 0.3 mm NiTi super-elastic wires for its mechanical structure which enable two degrees of freedom (DOF) in any directions between -85 degrees and 85 degrees. The two DOFs of the wrist and the DOF of the forceps are driven by a handled basic system using pulleys, 0.5mm Topline/spl reg/ ropes connected to NiTi wires and four RC-servomotors. In the first prototype 6 electrical wires, 2 micro-light emitters and 4 fiberoptics were successfully integrated. We are convinced of the effectiveness of this compact disposable plastic wrist, to be used with a usual or a motorised handled surgical instrument and integrating new functionalities such as electrical/optical/fluidics connections for smart surgical embedded micro-systems like micro-sensors and micro-actuators.",

The feature of the proposed method is that each AGV subsystem creates the routing to minimize the sum of the transportation time and the penalty for collision avoidance constraints taking into account motion delay disturbances for other AGVs. The computational results show that the total transportation time obtained by the proposed method is shorter than that of the conventional method under various type of motion delay disturbances.",

        "abstract": "A four degree of freedom thermally actuated MEMS microgripper is presented in this paper. Each jaw of the microgripper has independent x and y degrees of freedom. These extra degrees of freedom give the gripper added dexterity for manipulating microparts. The motion of each gripper jaw is provided by a two degree of freedom compliant mechanism which is based on a five bar rigid link mechanism. This gripper also introduces a novel thermal microactuator design that is capable of bi-directional actuation giving it a greater range of motion than previous thermal actuator designs. The actuator provides a total range of motion of 12.7 /spl mu/m and a maximum force of 1.9 mN. Also, since this microgripper is based on a compliant mechanism, deformable object tracking can be used to provide force as well as position feedback for the gripper. This combination of an increased number of degrees of freedom and increased sensory feedback provides a level of dexterity that has not been previously available in microassembly.",

One necessary functionality of such systems is their ability to move in a platoon fashion. Platooning of these automatic guided vehicles, relying on RTK-GPS sensors and inter-vehicles communication, is addressed in this paper. The developed control law is based on a global control strategy; actually, it can take into account all the platoon state, and not only the immediate previous vehicle state. Distance here is understood as difference of curvilinear abscissa along a reference trajectory. Relying on nonlinear control theory, lateral and longitudinal control are fully decoupled, and therefore addressed independently. To ensure passengers comfort, additional monitoring functions supervise our control system. Then, experiment, carried out with urban vehicles, and simulations of long platoon, are presented.",

As part of this project, a mobile robot, MOLE I has been designed that takes readings of underground chemical concentrations by inserting a probe into the ground at a sequence of locations. The robot is guided towards regions of higher chemical concentration using the hex-path algorithm. This algorithm was developed especially for the task of locating underground chemical sources and this is the first time that it has been tested using a mobile robot. There are important economic, environmental and humanitarian applications for systems that can find the source of an odor or volatile chemical located beneath the ground. These applications range from harvesting truffles, to finding the location of leaking chemical storage tanks and unexploded ordinance. In this paper, the robot construction and hex-path algorithm are described together with experimental results that demonstrate the capabilities of the robot system.",

Employing top-down design approach, we propose a hierarchical architecture consisting of five levels: task level, role (or mode) level, behavior level, action level and controller level, to formalize the processes from task decomposition, role assignments and control performance. Two typical cases are developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the architecture and corresponding experimental results show that high efficiency and much greater capabilities are exhibited when the fish try to cooperate.",

ORTW-II is the second version of a walking aid system with an omnidirectional platform and uses MR brakes for its control. A new interpretation of paths, called potential canal is conducted in this paper in order to realize tracking via merely control of brakes of the passive system. Unlike most tracking methods which attempt to lead an objective system on a desired trajectory, in the new algorithm, a mobile system's motion is constrained in a pathway rather than a single trajectory and motion can be conducted by the user. In systems with direct human interaction similar to walking aid systems, the new method is expected to increase user-dependability of the system's behavior while increasing user's freedom. A collision-free potential canal is maintained using a realtime modification method, based on environmental information.

It is intended for application to navigation in an environment that is not mapped, but in which a mission is described in the form of a semantic description of the perception stimulus that the robot is expected to encounter. The need to integrate features from different sensors led to the use of an uncertainty estimate employed in information theory; binary entropy. By using entropy, the features are ranked in order of decreasing uncertainty. This article describes the state of the work in an as yet preliminary stage, but appears promising for application to navigation using topological information. It also offers interesting perspectives on commonly used sensory data such as local intensity image features.",

        "abstract": "Movement and behavior analysis is a key research area in the domain of biomedical engineering and in many other medical research domains aiming at the understanding of physiological motor and cognitive basic mechanisms. The systematic application of robotic and mechatronic technologies to realize new tools and measurement methods for quantitatively assessing motor and cognitive functions in humans as well as in animal models is gaining an increasing popularity. This work represents a first step towards the development of a sensorised environment for behavioral phenotyping of animal models. In particular, this paper focuses on tremor analysis in reeler mice, an emerging potential animal model for anatomical and behavioral traits observed in autism. Ground reaction force (GRF) sensing is indeed the most direct means of measuring tremor. Although force platforms have extensively been used for large size animals, only few attempts have been made to measure GRF at a single paw for animals as small as mice or rats. Under the hypothesis that in-plane GRF components are directly connected to tremor, a small size, low-cost, 2-axis force sensor for measuring the in-plane components of GRF was designed and developed. Special care was paid to design a structure that would allow self-aligned assembly, for repeatability, and modularity for combining multiple platforms for a sensorised floor. Preliminarily testing was performed with both reeler and wildtype mice. Fourier analysis was deployed to extract information due to tremor, validating the hypothesis of a direct connection between tremor and in-plane GRFs.",

This leads to the logistical problem with coordination and control of a large number of cameras. In this paper, we used a lightweight multi-agent system for coordinating such camera arrays. The agent framework provides more than a remote sensor access API. It allows reconfigurable and transparent access to cameras, as well as software agents capable of intelligent processing. Furthermore, it eases maintenance by encouraging code reuse. Additionally, our agent system includes an automatic discovery mechanism at startup, and multiple language bindings. Performance tests showed the lightweight nature of the framework while validating its correctness and scalability. Two different camera agents were implemented to provide access to a large array of distributed cameras. Correct operation of these camera agents was confirmed via several image processing agents.",

Experimental results using a zoom camera and a 7-DOF serial manipulator prove the effectiveness of the approach.",

One of the significant features of our approach is that we explicitly exploit \"emergent phenomena\" stemming from the interplay between control and mechanical systems in order to control the morphology in real time. To this end, we particularly focus on a \"functional material\" and a \"mutual entrainment\", the former of which is used as a spontaneous connectivity control mechanism between the modules, and the latter of which plays as the core of the control mechanism for the generation of locomotion. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm can induce locomotion, which allows us to successfully control the morphology of the modular robot in real time according to the situation without losing the coherence of the entire system.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates impressions on the robot motion based on EDA experiments, deduces a motion rule for human-friendly robots from the investigations, and applies it to a mobile robot experimental apparatus. In our previous work, it was suggested that actuation noise come from the robots tended to raise the sympathetic nerve system (SNS) response of the heart rate variability. In another experiment it is observed that blocking out either the sound or the sight attenuated the electrodermal activity (EDA), which reflects the SNS, to the robot motion. In the present work, the experiment was designed not so as to avoid the influence of the habituation differently from the previous experiments, which was the significant factor contributing to reducing the EDA responses. As a result of statistical analysis, it was concluded that the present work supported the result of the previous work. Based on these investigations, we deduced the motion rule for human-friendly robots from this investigation, that robots must reduce their motion speed in the immediate vicinity of humans. We constructed the experimental setup that a mobile robot approached human with its speed decreased in conformity with the rule. To estimate the distance from the human, the skin color detection and depth-from-focus techniques were applied to a monocular color video camera system with pan/tilt/zoom operation. The experimental result showed that a proper choice of commands could perform the robot motion to reduce its speed in the immediate vicinity of the human.",

In the past, many multi-degree-of-freedom actuators have been developed. However, they are all still large and heavy. Thus, we propose a miniature multi-degree-of-freedom actuator using plural single-phase-driven ultrasonic vibrators. A single-phase-driven ultrasonic motor is known for its miniaturizing facility. On the other hand, it is also known for its lack of output force. Therefore, we proposed to use plural single-phase-driven vibrators and also tried to make one vibrator generate great force. This motor has many small vibrators; each one having four patterns in the thrust direction. By controlling the frequency of each vibrator, we can obtain multiple movements of a movable object. First, we proposed the principles of this motor. Next, we selected vibration modes and designed the size of a vibrator to be 10 /spl times/ 7.5 /spl times/ 0.9 mm/sup 3/ using finite element analysis. Finally, we measured frequency, vibration, and driving characteristics of the vibrators. The maximum thrust was about 3.14 N and the maximum torque was about 6mN-m.",

Additionally, such robots will need to be taught unknown objects that are present in private homes. We present a multi-modal object attention system that is able to identify objects referenced by the user with gestures and verbal instructions. The proposed system can detect known and unknown objects and stores newly acquired object information in a scene model for later retrieval. This way, the growing knowledge base of the robot companion improves the interaction quality as the robot can more easily focus its attention on objects it has been taught previously.",

        "abstract": "Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) is increasingly important for wheeled mobile robots (WMRs). One of the most promising approaches is the so-called particle filter (also known as sequential Monte Carlo) method. In this paper, rule based inference and multiple particle filters are integrated to diagnose hard faults of WMR's dead reckoning system. The rule based inference method is employed to determine the states of the movement of the robot in plane and each state of movement is monitored with a particle filter. This approach presents a general framework to combine domain knowledge with particle filters. The key advantage of the proposed method is that it decreases the size of the state space for each particle filter. As a result, it decreases particle number and increases efficiency and accuracy for each particle filter. Experiment performed on a mobile robot shows the improvement in accuracy and efficiency.",

This work deals with development of effective redundancy resolution algorithms for the motion control of humanoid. Differently from the typical kinematically redundant robots that are attached to the fixed ground, the ZMP condition should be taken into account in the human body motion in order to guarantee the system stability. For this, a geometric constraint equation is derived by reshaping the existing ZMP equation. This constraint equation is formed like a second order kinematic equation, which enables one to plan the ZMP trajectory in a feedforward fashion. This constraint equation and the kinematic equation of the humanoid model are solved together. A sequential redundancy resolution algorithm exploiting the remaining kinematic redundancy is also proposed to optimize several secondary criteria such as joint limit index and manipulability. The feasibility of the proposed algorithms is verified by simulating a stable standing up motion and a planar walking motion though planar 5 DOF and 6 DOF humanoid models.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We describe a new method for position estimation of planar surfaces using simple, low-cost infrared (IR) sensors. The intensity data acquired with IR sensors depends highly on the surface properties and the configuration of the sensors with respect to the surface. Therefore, in many related studies, either the properties of the surface are determined first or certain assumptions about the surface are made to estimate the distance and the orientation of the surface relative to the sensors. We propose a novel method for position estimation of surfaces with IR sensors without the need to determine the surface properties first. The method is considered to be independent of the type of surface encountered since it is based on searching the position of the maximum value of the intensity data rather than using absolute intensity values. The method is verified experimentally with planar surfaces of different surface properties. An intelligent feature of our system is that its operating range is made adaptive based on the maximum intensity of the detected signal. The absolute mean range error for the method resulting in the lowest errors is 0.15 cm over the range from 10 to 50 cm. The cases where the azimuth and elevation angles are nonzero are considered as well. The results obtained demonstrate that IR sensors can be used for localization to an unexpectedly high accuracy without prior knowledge of the surface characteristics.",

        "abstract": "The paper presents a new approach to construct a control law that realizes a main task and simultaneously takes supplementary constraints into account. Classically, this is done by using the redundancy formalism. If the main task does not constrain all the motions of the robot, a secondary task can be achieved by using only the remaining degrees of freedom (DOF). We propose a new general method that frees up some of the DOF constrained by the main task in addition of the remaining DOF. The general idea is to enable the motions produced by the secondary control law that help the main task to be completed faster. The main advantage is to enhance the performance of the secondary task by enlarging the number of available DOF. In a formal framework, a projection operator is built which ensures that the secondary control law does not disturb the main task. A control law can be then easily computed from the two tasks considered. Experiments that implement and validate this approach are proposed. The visual servoing framework is used to position a 6-DOF robot while simultaneously avoiding occlusions and joint limits.",

According to modular robot concept, a new dynamic modeling method is proposed in consideration of interactive motions, nonholonomic constraints and self-motions. Then, an online self-motion planner (SMP) and a robust adaptive neural-fuzzy controller (RANFC) are devised; the former is used to generate desired self-motions in a real-time manner, while the latter is used to prevent the robot from overturning and to control the end-effector to follow a desired spacial trajectory at the same time. The proposed algorithm does not need exact apriori knowledge of dynamic parameters and can suppress bounded external disturbance effectively.

        "abstract": "In this paper, a force control technique is applied to an autonomous aerial helicopter system. Applying a force control technique to a helicopter system is quite new since the helicopter system is mostly used for carrying humans or objects and navigating. For those operations, speed control is used most. For a specific task, however, position control for attitude control application is required as well. Here, the speed of a helicopter is controlled by the LQR method, and position is controlled by closing the other outer loop. After the position control is done, the force control is also applied. The adaptive impedance force control algorithm is applied and tested to control the desired force under unknown location and stiffness of the environment. The simple adaptive law minimizes the force tracking error. Simulation studies show that the proposed control algorithm works well.",

This paper proposes a novel fin type of model microrobot utilizing electromagnetic actuator as the servo actuator to realize moving motion for biomedical application. We also discuss the structure, motion mechanism and characteristic evaluation of a driving fin. The moving fin driven by a permanent magnet can be controlled by the frequency adjustment of the alternate magnetic field. The running speed of the microrobot has been measured in vertical direction and at turning point by changing the frequency of input current. Experimental results showed that the maximum running speed 40mm/s could be obtained in vertical direction. The developed microrobot has characteristics of compact volume, quick response, can correspond to the dirt adhering to the inner wall, or long distance movement, and running speed control can be easily performed by frequency adjustment. It will be very useful for industrial application and for microsurgery.",

A prototype has been developed that integrates 4 sensitive areas, battery, and electronics for data acquisition and wireless transmission into a wearable insole. The prototype foot interface has been experimentally validated in the control of a robotic hand prosthesis. Comparative experimental trials were conducted with 10 able-bodied subjects, with both the foot interface and an EMG-based control, which represents the most advanced interface currently available in clinical implants for amputees. The results confirmed the effectiveness of the foot interface in the control of the hand prosthesis and showed a significant decrease in required adaptation and learning from the user's side.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, the dynamic modelling and control design of a planar parallel manipulator used as a pick-and-place machine, is addressed. First, in a departure from standard modelling techniques utilized for planar parallel mechanisms, it is demonstrated that since the translational axes of the manipulator are driven by DC motors through industry standard ball screws, the nonlinear dynamics and coupling effects of the nonlinear dynamics of the manipulator are greatly reduced by a very large effective gear ratio factor, in this case, 1.097 xlO6. The dynamics of the driving motors thus become the dominant dynamics in the system. Hence, the dynamics of the entire system can be approximated as a set of three identical linear dynamic equations, each of which represents the dynamics of one kinematic chain, with constraints representing the coupling of these axes. Then a robust closed-loop controller designed with a Convex Integrated Design (CID) method is determined, such that multiple closed-loop performance specifications, together with a robustness specification, are simultaneously satisfied. The robustness of the closed-loop controller thus guarantees that the controller, although determined based on a simplified linear model, performs as expected on the practical system, i.e., the manipulator, hence results in satisfactory closed-loop performance. Both simulation and experiments conducted demonstrate that the multiple simultaneous closed-loop performance specifications are satisfied thus validating the simplified modeling strategy and verifying the effectiveness of the control design approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a planning method based on mapping moving obstacles into C-space for safe interaction between human arms and robot manipulators. In pre-processing phase, a hybrid distance metric is defined to select neighboring sampled nodes in C-space to construct a roadmap. Then, two kinds of mapping are constructed to determine invalid and dangerous edges in the roadmap for each basic cell decomposed in workspace. For updating the roadmap when an obstacle is moving, basic cells covering the obstacle's surfaces are mapped into the roadmap by using new positions of the surfaces points sampled on the obstacle. In query phase, in order to predict and avoid coming collisions and reach the goal efficiently, an interaction strategy with six kinds of planning actions of searching, updating, walking, waiting, dodging and pausing are designed. Simulated experiments show that the proposed method is efficient for safe interaction between two working robot manipulators and two randomly moving human arms.",

Since a H-slit beam unidirectionally deforms, only the normal force from the ground is selectively detected without being affected from the friction force between the sole and ground. The plantar H-slit force sensors are developed for a humanoid robot. A model is proposed to simulate the sensor output.

However, control and self-localization of omni directional mobile robots are important issues and different teams in the Robocup competitions have used different techniques to tackle it. Since it is very complicated to calculate the omni directional system transfer function as in classic control, a simplified model of the system would be helpful for estimating the PID coefficients of the robots' position and orientation control. The vision-based self-localization combined with the odometry system enables us to have a robust self-localization method.

We present a graph-based algorithm to coordinate a group of robots which takes the limitations and uncertainties of sensors into account and is able to find good coordination plans efficiently even for large environments. We analyze and compare the approach against other coordination strategies based on a new probabilistic framework that allows to evaluate the performance of any coordination strategy based on a probabilistic sensor model and a worst case behavior model for intruders. Using this framework we demonstrate the capabilities of the planning algorithm in several simulation experiments.",

The mode selection process is done in two steps: the best suited mode is firstly selected on the basis of initial information or a qualitative map built on-line by the robot. Then, the motions of the robot are monitored by various processes that update mode transition probabilities in a Markov system. The paper focuses on this latter selection process: the overall approach is depicted, and preliminary experimental results are presented.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to real-time 3D modeling of workspace for manipulative robotic tasks. First, we establish the three fundamental principles that human uses for modeling and interacting with environment. These principles have led to the development of an integrated approach to real-time 3D modeling, as follows: 1) It starts with a rapid but approximate characterization of the geometric configuration of workspace by identifying global plane features. 2) It quickly recognizes known objects in workspace and replaces them by their models in database based on in-situ registration. 3) It models the geometric details on the fly adaptively to the need of the given task based on a multi-resolution octree representation. SIFT features with their 3D position data, referred to here as stereo-sis SIFT, are used extensively, together with point clouds, for fast extraction of global plane features, for fast recognition of objects, for fast registration of scenes, as well as for overcoming incomplete and noisy nature of point clouds. The experimental results show the feasibility of real-time and behavior-oriented 3D modeling of workspace for robotic manipulative tasks.",

The proposed solution empowers specialized roboticists to contribute software components that can be integrated into complete real-time systems. The framework also facilitates robotic software components reuse and portability across hardware platforms. Based on an indoor navigation case study we evaluate the advantages and the limitations of the framework in terms of ease of use, modularity and real-time capabilities.",

In this paper, we proposed an algorithm to generate labels and transition rules for robots to producing an arbitrary two dimensional structure with only local sensing. The algorithm proceeds by first partitioning the desired structure into a set of rectangles, generating rules and labels for each rectangle, assigning labels to tiles to be placed, generating rules to connect the rectangles, and finally replacing redundant labels and rules in a post-processing step. This algorithm guarantees convergence to the desired structure, produces fewer labels than those algorithms found in the literature, and has the potential to handle structures impossible with a single seed.",

Repetitive trajectories, a preplanned periodic motion, are obtained from general polynomial trajectory planning method by connecting the end point of trajectory to start point by enforcing continuous motion. After drag torque is described in terms of joint angles and velocities, directional drag force in task space is derived, which is used as objective function to be optimized during a time period. The genetic algorithm (GA) is adopted to find optimal parameters composing the coefficients of polynomials. To verify the correctness of proposed method, periodic motion planning examples of simple two-link planner robot are presented in this paper.",

However, human engineering ingenuity still falls short in comparison to nature's capabilities. This research area is inherently multidisciplinary in nature, calling for collaboration from biologists, neurologists and engineers. This paper is intended to provide an insight into force sensor design for microflight based on current biological, biomimetic and miniature sensors available to compare existing attempts and to make a framework to identify issues that need further attention.

The system plays roles of assisting surgeon for inserting a pedicle screw in spinal fusion. Compared to pure navigation systems as well as conventional methods for spinal fusion, it is able to achieve better accuracy through compensating for the portending movement of the surgical area. Furthermore, the robot can position and guide needles, drills, and other surgical instruments or conducts drilling/screwing directly. In preoperative surgery, the desired entry point, orientation, and depth of surgical tools for pedicle screw insertion are determined by the surgical planning system based on CT or MR images. Intra-operatively, the position information on the surgical instruments and the targeted surgical areas are obtained by the tracking system and, using that information, a robot conducts the preplanned operation depending on its role while compensating the movement of the surgical area. Two exemplary experiments employing the developed robot-assisted surgery system are conducted.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an emulating system for zero-gravity (0-G) emulation of a ground spacecraft in an earthbound (1-G) laboratory environment using a controlled manipulator. Such an emulating system allows testing of the spacecraft, e.g., a satellite, with all of its hardware in place, and it is applicable to the case of either a rigid spacecraft or a flexible spacecraft. The controller of the manipulator is developed to virtually change the mass properties of the ground spacecraft and to replicate either the free-space motion or the orbital motion dynamics of a flight-spacecraft. The stability of the system and the effects of disturbance and force sensor noise on the fidelity of the emulating system is thoroughly analyzed. The concept of the 0-G emulation of spacecraft is demonstrated by performing experiment for emulation of a satellite using a robotic testbed at the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a multicriteria image-based controller and describes an application of this result to the task sequencing problem. The method allows to stabilize the camera and determine the associated region of stability in spite of unknown value of the target points depth, bounds on admissible visual feature errors which guarantee visibility, and limits on the camera velocity and acceleration. The proposed formulation, based on a mixed polytopic and norm-bounded representation of uncertainties, allows to consider LMI-based optimization schemes to maximize the size of the region of stability associated to the closed-loop system. Through this result we show the interest of the approach for designing control strategies that allow to link dynamically a sequence of sensor-based tasks. An application of the result to a problem of task sequencing is simulated in the last section.",

In this paper, the micro biopsy module which is a part of the capsule endoscope is proposed. The proposed module is less than 2 mm in thickness and has a diameter of 10 mm. It consists of a trigger with paraffin block, rotational tissue-cutting razor with a torsion spring and controller. This module makes it possible for the capsule endoscope to obtain a sample tissue inside the small intestine which can not be reached by a conventional biopsy device. Through dedicated experiments, tissue samples were successfully extracted using the proposed biopsy module and the cells in samples were extracted and tested by a microscope.",

To the purpose, the use of a platoon of mobile robots is proposed to carry a number of repeater antennas; these must be suitably moved to dynamically ensure a multi-hop communication link to the vehicle that extends outside the area covered by the sole base antenna. Self configuration of the robots' platoon is then achieved by a singularity-robust task-priority inverse kinematics algorithm via the definition of suitable task functions. The obtained simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "A sensor platform has been developed that is capable of both aerial and terrestrial locomotion, as well as transitioning between the two. The morphing micro air-land vehicle (MMALV) implements biological inspiration in both flying and walking. MMALV integrates the University of Florida's micro air vehicle (MAV) technology with the terrain mobility of Mini-Whegs/spl trade/. Fabricated of lightweight carbon fiber, the UF-MAV employs a flexible wing design to achieve improved stability over other MAVs of similar size. Mini-Whegs/spl trade/ employs the patented (pending) wheel leg running gear that makes the Whegs/spl trade/ and Mini-Whegs/spl trade/ line of robots fast, agile, and efficient. MMALV has a 30.5cm wingspan, and is 25.4cm long. Terrestrial locomotion is achieved using two independently controlled wheel legs, which are differentially actuated to perform turning. The vehicle successfully performs the transition from flight to walking. Furthermore, MMALV is capable of transitioning from terrestrial to aerial locomotion by walking off a structure of only 20 feet. A wing retraction mechanism improves the portability of the vehicle, as well as its terrestrial stealth and ability to enter small openings.",

Insects and geckos can provide inspiration for both novel adhesive technology and for the locomotory mechanisms employed during climbing. For this work, Mini-Whegs/spl trade/, a small quadruped robot that uses wheel-legs for locomotion, was altered to explore the feasibility of scaling vertical surfaces using compliant, adhesive feet. Modifications were made to reduce its weight, and its legs were redesigned to enable its feet to better attach and detach from the substrate, mimicking homologous actions observed in animals. The resulting vehicle is self-contained, power-autonomous, and weighs only 87 grams. Using pressure-sensitive tape, it is capable of walking up a vertical surface, walking upside-down along an inverted surface, and transitioning between orthogonal surfaces.",

        "abstract": "A rheology object means a visco-elastic object with some residual displacement. The modeling is useful to manipulate a real rheology object by a robot hand/arm or to feel a contact impulse (forces) from a virtual one by some haptic device. In our previous works, we compared several types of MSD models with/without two kinds of conservation laws of volume by giving position replacements at some surrounding masses, calibrating and evaluating shape differences between virtual and real rheology objects. Concerning to shape precision, the combination is wonderful. Also, the model including conservation laws of volume is better than the model excluding them. However, concerning to force precision, they are unfortunately meaningless. To overcome this drawback in this paper, we compare the types of MSD models by giving, calibrating and evaluating impulses and their differences at the masses around the virtual and real rheology objects. As a result, for the purpose, the new combination is suitable. Furthermore, concerning to force precision, the model excluding conservation laws of volume is better than the model including them.",

The representation combines Isomap, a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm, with expectation maximization, a statistical learning scheme. The joint probability distribution of this representation is computed offline based on existing training data. The training phase of the algorithm results in a nonlinear and non-Gaussian likelihood model of natural features conditioned on the underlying visual states. This generative model can be used online to instantiate likelihoods corresponding to observed visual features in real-time. The instantiated likelihoods are expressed as a Gaussian mixture model and are conveniently integrated within existing non-linear filtering algorithms. Example applications based on real visual data from heterogenous, unstructured environments demonstrate the versatility of the generative models.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a system for which applications in the field of personal navigation are planned. In the current version, the system embodies a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and an inertial measurement unit (IMU), composed of two dual-axis accelerometers and one single-axis gyro. The IMU is positioned at a subject's foot instep, and it is intended to produce estimates of some gait parameters, including stride length, stride time, and walking speed. Data from GPS and IMU are managed by a DSP-based control box. The computations performed by the DSP processor allow to detect subsequent foot contacts by a threshold-based method applied to gyro signal, and to reconstruct the trajectory of the foot instep by numerical strapdown integration. Features of human walking dynamics are incorporated in the algorithm to enhance the estimation accuracy against errors due to sensor noise and integration drift. All computations are performed by the DSP processor in real-time conditions. The foot sensor performance is assessed during outdoor level walking trials. The traveled distance estimated by inertial dead-reckoning is compared with the estimate produced by GPS in experimental conditions where GPS can be used as a reference source for accurate absolute positioning. Results show the remarkable accuracy achieved by foot inertial sensing.",

        "abstract": "Traditionally, the problem of stereo matching has been addressed either by a sparse feature-based approach or a dense area-based approach. This technique still suffers from a lack in accuracy or long computation time needed to match stereo images. In this paper, we employ color segments on scan lines of stereo images as primitives for matching, and introduce the widely used fuzzy set theory to the matching processes in order to handle ambiguities in matching. During the stage of accurate pixel correspondences of matched color segments, we use the technique of dynamic time warping (DTW), which is used in speech recognition. We found that DTW works robustly and rapidly regardless of the number of points to be matched. Covering more image space than point elements and providing more information than gray level features, color segments are less sensitive to noise and photometric variations and are thus more easily matched, and can reduce the false matches. Furthermore, a post-processing step can find more matches and alleviate the influence of under-segmentation or over-segmentation. A fast median filter can be applied to the results to further remove outliers. Experiments have been performed to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm.",

The system consists of mobile sensors that guard a rectangular surveillance zone crisscrossed by moving targets. Targets penetrate the surveillance zone with poisson rates at uniform velocities. Under these conditions we present a motion strategy computation for each sensor such that it maximizes target detection for the next T time-steps. A coordination mechanism among sensors ensures that overlapping and overlooked regions of observation among sensors are minimized. This coordination mechanism is interleaved with the motion strategy computation to reduce detections of the same target by more than one sensor for the same time-step. To avoid an exhaustive search in the joint space of all the sensors the coordination mechanism constrains the search by assigning priorities to the sensors and thereby arbitrating among sensory tasks. A comparison of this methodology with other multi target tracking schemes verifies its efficacy in maximizing detections. \"Sample\" and \"time-step\" are used equivalently and interchangeably in this paper.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a useful tactile display method that can control multiple tactile sensations such as roughness, pressure, and friction sensations using simple vibratory stimulations. Our concepts are based on two points: frequency range selection for making selective stimulation on different tactile receptors types and timing control of the stimulation in response to hand movements. The selective stimulations were realized by selecting reactive frequencies of vibratory stimulation based on temporal response characteristics of tactile receptors. For representing roughness sensation, vibrating frequencies were modulated in response to hand velocity considered as a temporal coding perception of FA I type receptor. Two reactive frequencies were also selected for representing pressure sensation and friction sensation corresponding to SA I and FA II type receptors respectively. A wearable tactile display using ICPF (ionic conducting polymer gel film) actuators verified our proposed methods. Finally, we conducted a total texture feeling display combined with our methods for roughness, pressure, and friction sensations in a parameterized manner. Comparison with real clothes showed that some combinations of multiple tactile sensations could express texture feels of the expected materials.",

        "abstract": "We propose a method for promoting human-robot interaction based on emotion recognition with particular focus on tension emotion. There are two types of emotions expressed in a short time. One is autonomic emotion caused by a stimulus, such as joy and fear. The other is self-reported emotion, such as tension, that is relatively independent of a single stimulus. In our preliminary experiment, we observed that tension emotion (self-reported emotion) obstructs the expression of autonomic emotion, which has demerits on speech recognition and interaction. Our method is based on detection and moderation of tension emotion. If a robot detects tension emotion, it tries to ease it so that a person will interact with it more comfortably and express autonomic emotions. It also retrieves nuances from expressed emotions for supplementing insufficient speech recognition, which will also promote interaction.",

Based on the dynamic leader-follower model, a reactive tracking controller is proposed to make each following robot maintain a desired pose to its leader, and the stability property of this controller is discussed using Lyapunov theory. By employing such controllers, the N-robot formation control problem can be decomposed into decentralized tracking problems between N-l followers and designated leaders. Additionally, graph theory is introduced to formalize general formation patterns in a simple but effective way and two types of switching between these formations are also proposed. Numerical simulations and physical robots experiments show the effectiveness of our approach.",

Most of the previously built conversational robots cannot perform dialogue management necessary for accurately recognizing human intentions and providing information to humans. This model integrates robot behavior planning models with spoken dialogue management that is robust enough to engage in mixed-initiative dialogues in specific domains. It has two layers; the upper layer is responsible for global task planning using hierarchical planning and the lower layer engages in local planning by utilizing modules called experts, which are specialized for performing certain kind of tasks by performing physical actions and engaging in dialogues. This model enables switching and canceling tasks based on recognized human intentions. A preliminary implementation of the model, which has been integrated with Honda ASIMO, has shown its effectiveness.",

This method allows us to reformulate control problems as a special class of optimal control. We take this line of reasoning one step further and demonstrate that well-known and also several novel nonlinear robot control laws can be derived from this generic methodology. We show experimental verifications on a Sarcos Master Arm robot for some of the derived controllers. We believe that the suggested approach offers a promising unification and simplification of nonlinear control law design for robots obeying rigid body dynamics equations, both with or without external constraints, with over-actuation or underactuation, as well as open-chain and closed-chain kinematics.",

The workspace is captured using a stereo camera, and heterogeneously modeled with the recognized plane features, recognized objects with complete solid models, and unrecognized 3D point clouds organized with a multi-resolution octree. When the service robot is requested to manipulate a recognized object, the local accessibility information for the object is retrieved from the object database. Then, accessibility analysis is done to verify the object accessibility and determine the global accessibility. The verification process utilizes the visibility query, which is accelerated by graphics hardware. The experimental results show the feasibility of real-time and behavior-oriented 3D modeling of workspace for robotic manipulative tasks, and also the performance gain of the hardware-accelerated accessibility analysis obtained using the commodity graphics card.",

Although authentication is indispensable for useful robot services, the traditional approaches that have been applied in strictly regulated environments cannot be applied as they are when both the robot and humans are freely moving around. In this paper, a new authentication system redesigned to be adapted to robot environments is described. In the proposed system, semi-biometrics and user tracking are incorporated to cope with the limited applicability of traditional authentication techniques. Semi-biometrics indicates a set of features useful for discriminating persons, but only in interested group of persons and in interested frame of time. As a representative semi-biometric feature, body height and color characteristics of the clothes are investigated. Especially, a novel method to measure body height with single camera is proposed. Also by incorporating tracking functionality, the system could maintain the user status information continuously, which is useful not only for recognition but also for finding a designated person.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a visual servoing system for an underwater legged robotic system named AQUA and initial experiments with the system performed in the open sea. A large class of significant applications can be leveraged by allowing such a robot to follow a diver or some other moving target. The robot uses a suite of sensing technologies, primarily based on computer vision, to allow it to navigate in shallow-water environments. The visual servoing system described here allows the robot to track and follow a given target underwater. The servo package is made up of two distinct parts: a tracker and a feedback controller. The system has been evaluated in the sea water and under natural lighting conditions. The servo system has been tested underwater, and with minor modifications, the system can be used while the robot is walking on the ground as well.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an accurate kinesthetic haptic display method for a multi-DOF haptic interface. Position-position (p-p) architecture plays an important role in a haptic interface like four channel architecture since force reflection using only force sensor information induces a serious problem if a slave manipulator is constrained by unexpected obstacles the force sensor cannot detect. However, the conventional p-p architecture in literature has limitations to apply to a multi-DOF haptic interface. This paper indicates the limitation through an example and proposes a novel haptic display method using instantaneous restriction space (IRS). IRS can be calculated using Jacobian and joint angle error of a slave manipulator. Since the proposed method has the form of impedance two port architecture in the sense of data flow, it can be easily combined with the previous results of two-port haptic display framework in literature. The method is compared to the conventional p-p architecture through experiments.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "To improve the maneuverability of underwater vehicles, accurate thrust model is required. However, its modeling is not only difficult but also inaccurate, because it has highly nonlinear dynamics and many parameters which cannot be modeled exactly. Generally, a propeller's steady-state axial thrust is proportional to the signed square of propeller shaft velocity under bollard pull condition. And, it is reported that the velocity of the ambient flow of the thruster affects the thrust force largely. From these facts, we can easily make a reasonable inference that the thrust force may also be affected by the thruster spouting angle with respect to the vehicle moving direction. However, the effect of this non-parallel ambient flow is not well understood in the previous works. Hence, in this paper, a new parameter, what we call incoming angle, is introduced and its effect on thrust force is shown. Incoming angle is defined as the angle between the direction of thrust and that of vehicle velocity. The effect of this angle can be dominant during an underwater vehicle changes its direction, or an omni-directional vehicle carries out its task. The effect cannot be compensated by including the only parallel component of vehicle velocity into previous models. In this paper, based on the three axial flow states classification model, the effect of the incoming angle of ambient flow is analyzed, and critical incoming angle (CIA) is also defined to describe the thrust force states according to incoming angle. In order to characterize the effect of non-parallel ambient flow, the proposed model is evaluated by comparing experimental data with numerical model simulation data, and it accurately covers overall flow conditions within /spl plusmn/2N force error.",

In this paper, we suggest that sound signal can be used to relay navigation information to the operator to substitute other sensory information such as two-dimensional vision and multidimensional force feedback. The rationale for using an acoustic interface is that it utilizes significantly less bandwidth than visual information, and it has higher stability compared with force feedback. A four-section psychological experiment was devised to investigate human teleoperation performance under different sensory feedback and evaluate the effectiveness of acoustic information. The preliminary tests results show that the human operator can sufficiently perceive the remote environment through audio feedback for remote teleoperation tasks.",

Specifically, our approach is built on the premise that qualitative spatial reasoning is an appropriate framework to pose, learn, and solve navigational tasks. As such, the robot must be able to acquire and maintain landmarks in a form that facilitates learning and subsequent travel. Much research on landmark recognition has focused on either point landmarks or on landmark objects that come from segmentation and feature extraction. Here, we combine these approaches in the following sense. Potential landmark points are acquired in the point mode, but aggregations of them are utilized to represent \"interesting\" objects that can then be maintained throughout the path. In this paper, we investigate whether consistent aggregations can be maintained and thus serve as candidate chunks for the working memory system. The approach was tested on a video sequence of 1200 frames. Examples from this outdoor video are shown to corroborate the approach.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous robots act according to the information they acquire from the environment. However, in real environments, the acquisition of the information regarding an object is often disturbed. This paper deals with the problem of developing an intelligent control for autonomous mobile robots to make them able to adapt to dynamic environment even when the uncertainty of information exists. RoboCup soccer robot is chosen as a demonstration target. In the method we propose, robots extrapolate missing environmental information with short-term memory. However, the acquired or extrapolated information is not always certain. In order to reduce the influences caused by misunderstandings and errors of information, it might be desirable that the robots use qualitative information for the situation where the reliability of information is low. Therefore, in our method, the each robot has an integrator which switches three kinds of action selectors, \"quantitative\", \"qualitative\" and \"base\" according to the reliability index of information. Each action selector operates on some action modules. The action selector selects the action module according to the environmental information. The integrator which is constructed by neural network selects the most suitable action selector based on \"reliability indexes\" of the ball position and the self-position estimated with short-term memory. The usefulness of this control system was shown through simulations.",

        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the problem of appearance-based active multi-sensor object recognition/pose estimation in the presence of structured noise. It is assumed that multiple cameras acquire images from an object belonging to a set of known objects. An algorithm is proposed for optimal sequential positioning of the cameras in order to estimate the class and pose of the object from sensory observations. The principle component analysis is used to produce the observation vector from the acquired images. Object occlusion and sensor noise have been explicitly incorporated into the recognition process using a probabilistic approach. A recursive Bayesian state estimation problem is formulated that employs the mutual information in order to determine the best next camera positions based on the available information. Experiments with a two-camera system demonstrate that the proposed method is highly effective in object recognition/pose estimation in the presence of occlusion.",

While most vision systems for tracking people on mobile robots use skin color information, we present an approach using thermal images and a fast contour model together with a particle filter. With this method a person can be detected independently from current light conditions and in situations where no skin color is visible (the person is not close or does not face the robot). Tracking in thermal images is used as an attention system to get an estimate of the position of a person. Based on this estimate we use a pan-tilt camera to zoom to the expected face region and apply a fast face tracker in combination with face recognition to identify the person.",

However, with a multiple-robot system, one must take care to ensure that the individual robots that compose a system make their decisions in concert with each other. We desire decisions to be made at the system level. In this paper, we investigate four different mechanisms to allow individual robots within a system to express their preference for a particular solution to a system-level problem. All four mechanisms consistently produced unanimous decisions, but had varying ability to produce unanimous decisions of good quality. An approach that we refer to as passive expression of preference performed the best, but had to be tuned to the particular problem being solved. A mechanism that we refer to as active expression of preference exhibited very good performance and required no problem specific tuning, which makes it more universally applicable to the multiple-robot decision-making problem.",

A key point is a new combination of a structure system and a control system, not only one of the two. First, a camera configuration with only one camera is proposed to achieve lower initial cost. This configuration requires more robustness. Second, in order to realize the vision, a robust control system is designed in the presence of uncertainty and constraint. Finally, the validity is confirmed by experiments in an actual open field. The camera configuration can not work well without the designed controllers. That is, the robust controllers reduce the initial cost.",

However, we believe that the problem to be addressed is more general and should not be restricted only to communication engineering: the interfaced system as a whole should adapt to get the most from the user, from the connection, and from the robot, even when no strict performance is possible. For that purpose, this paper introduces a new architecture for Web remote operation of robots that exhibits a high degree of flexibility in its adaptation to each particular user (through modular, configurable JAVA applets), to the system time-varying performance (through probability-guided, run-time adaptation of control loops), and to the robot software architecture (the standard CORBA is assumed as its middleware). Our approach constitutes an initial step for adapting comprehensively to all the mentioned issues, hence permitting to be employed in very different scenarios: realtime control, telecare, remote surveillance, etc.",

As a first step to achieve the function, we try to estimate a human's state in sleep using a wearable sensor device, under less physical movement than daytime. In the next step, we try to control human biological rhythm using the method to estimate human sleep state. We consider the simplest way to control human's sleep is to control awakening timing and sleep time. The proposed system can estimate human sleep quality and rhythms, and provide stimuli based on wake up timing. The system uses only pulse wave to estimate sleep quality because the pulse wave can be measured more easily than PSG.",

        "abstract": "Monitoring environmental phenomena by distributed sensor sampling confronts the challenge of unpredictable variability in the spatial distribution of phenomena often coupled with demands for a high spatial sampling rate. The introduction of actuation-enabled robotics sensors permits a system to optimize the sampling distribution through runtime adaptation. However, such systems must efficiently dispense sampling points or otherwise suffer from poor temporal response. In this paper, we propose and characterize an active modeling system. In our approach, as the robotic sensor acquires measurement samples of the environment, it builds a model of the phenomenon. Our algorithm is based on an incremental optimization process where the robot supports a continuous, iterative process of 1) collecting samples with maximal coverage in the design space; 2) building the environmental model; 3) predicting sampling point locations that contribute the greatest certainty regarding the phenomenon; and 4) sampling the environment based on a combined measure of information gain and navigation and sampling cost. This can provide significant reductions in the magnitude of field estimation error with a modest navigational trajectory time. We evaluate our algorithm through a simulation, using a combination of static and mobile sensors sampling light illumination field.",

        "abstract": "Sampling based planners have become increasingly efficient in solving the problems of classical motion planning and its applications. In particular, techniques based on the rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) have generated highly successful single-query planners. Recently, a variant of this planner called dynamic-domain RRT was introduced by Yershova et al. (2005). It relies on a new sampling scheme that improves the performance of the RRT approach on many motion planning problems. One of the drawbacks of this method is that it introduces a new parameter that requires careful tuning. In this paper we analyze the influence of this parameter and propose a new variant of the dynamic-domain RRT, which iteratively adapts the sampling domain for the Voronoi region of each node during the search process. This allows automatic tuning of the parameter and significantly increases the robustness of the algorithm. The resulting variant of the algorithm has been tested on several path planning problems.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims at developing an active force sensing technology for micromanipulation and microassembly using in-situ piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films symmetrically bonded to the surface of a flexible cantilever beam structure. The designed micro-force sensing beam has both sensing and actuating layers. The sensing layer can detect the deformation signal due to the external micro-force acting at the sensor tip, the signal is then fed back to the actuating layer through a servoed transfer function or servo controller, as a result, a counteracting bending moment generated by the actuating layer can be used to balance the deformation of sensor beam in real time. Once balanced, the sensor tip will maintain in the equilibrium position as if the sensor stiffness is virtually improved, yielding accurate motion control of the sensor tip. Especially, the micro-force can be obtained by calculating the balance force through the counteracting servo voltage applied to the actuating layer. The developed active structure greatly enlarge dynamic range of micro-force sensor and enhance the manipulability during micromanipulation/microassembly when the sensor is mounted at the end-effector. Preliminary calibration and experimental results both verified the performance of the developed active micro-force sensor and the effectiveness of the models.",

        "abstract": "We consider the view planning problem, also called, next best view (NBV) problem for sensor based exploration for general robot-sensor systems, where a range scanner is mounted on a robot with non-trivial kinematics, e.g., an eye-in-hand system. Earlier approaches to NBV had considered purely work-space (we also use the term physical-space) based criteria, such as select the view that maximizes the unknown physical-space volume. While this works well for mobile robots (often modeled as point or circle, thereby having trivial geometry and kinematics), it ignores a critical aspect, i.e., to give priority to exploring \"manoeuvrable\" space around the robot so that it can move to better viewing configurations. Proposed C-space based view planning criteria address this problem. However, C-space criteria (assuming the robot has enough manoeuvrable space) may sacrifice efficiency in work-space volume coverage. For inspection or environment modeling tasks, efficient workspace volume coverage is important. In this paper, we propose an adaptive algorithm that biases the search toward C-space or toward work-space, as needed. We call it adaptive viewpoint candidates entropy (VCE) criterion. Results with different simulated scenes show the effectiveness of this criterion in efficient (in that it needs less scans) exploration of the workspace.",

Space manipulators such as JEMRMS are subject to vibrations due to structural flexibility. To cope with such a drawback, control strategies for minimization of vibration excitation and for maximization of vibration damping have already been developed. However those strategies require an accurate model of the manipulator dynamics. If a payload with unknown dynamic properties is being handled, the use of the above stated strategies lead to vibration excitation, or to inaccurate positioning of the end point. In this paper, an adaptive control for the vibration suppression control is addressed to guarantee the stability of the system in the presence of model uncertainty.",

Then, we examine the trajectory of human arm for an elliptic constraint. To clarify the trajectory formation in constrained point-to-point motions, we analyze experimental data and test them against predictions obtained by conventional criteria of optimality. It is found in the comparative analysis that the best prediction is given by the minimum muscle force change criterion.",

In particular, accumulated sensor biases can render simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms of autonomous vehicles to perform very poorly especially in large unexplored terrains including cycles, as a result of the estimator divergence and inconsistency. One way to deal with this problem is the accurate modeling and precise calibration of sensors. However this may add up to longer setup and calibration times. Even after accurate calibration and modeling, sensor calibration may often subject to drifts, rendering the efforts ineffective. Therefore, the correct and effective way to deal with this problem is explicit estimation of these parameters with other states. In this work we address the estimation theoretic sensor bias correction problem in SLAM using a simple unified framework and establish theoretically, the behavior and properties of the solution with special consideration to diminishing uncertainty, rates of convergence and observability.",

        "abstract": "In this work, a novel environment representation method which facilitates path planning for biped walking robots is presented. The robot's environment is represented by a 2D map consisting of free regions, obstacle regions and feasible paths over the obstacle regions. In the free regions, standard path planning methods can be applied to plan paths around large obstacles. These paths are combined with paths over obstacle regions which include stepping over small obstacles as well as changing the walking level. Search for feasible paths rests upon the approximation of the robot by a set of hulls whose shapes allow efficient checking of the path feasibility. By considering only a restricted set of paths over obstacles, some generality is traded against better time performance.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel art gallery-based algorithm for placing a small number of guards to cover a global environment with obstacles for an autonomous robot. The guards are required to cover the entire workspace that is represented as a simple polygon with n vertices and h holes (obstacles). The proposed algorithm efficiently computes a (small) number of guards in simple polygons with holes, which runs in O (n log n) time and requires a linear storage complexity. However, an additional set of connection nodes is computed to form the connectivity graph, which contains all guards. This graph has far less number of vertices when compared to similar data structures used in conventional visibility-based or probabilistic-based motion planning algorithms. The resulting placement of guards and connectors can then be used as control points in the path of an autonomous mobile robot for navigation or inspection tasks. The proposed algorithm is not only offering a better performance in terms of computational cost but also an easy implementation. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and potential of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "We propose a distributed routing system for multi-robot cooperative transportation using parallel multiple processors with asynchronous data exchange. In the proposed method, each robot generates a routing to minimize each objective function comprising of traveling time and the penalty for violating constraints of cooperation with other robots. A near optimal routing is generated by repeating the generation of each routing and data exchange among the robots. Asynchronous data exchange is adopted to reduce the computation time. In order for the solution not to be trapped in a local optimum, the weighting factors violating the constraints are updated with a time-dependent method during parallel computation. The proposed method is applied to motion planning for cooperative transportation of an experimental 4 real robots system. The effectiveness of the proposed method is investigated on various types of experimental conditions.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Millimetre wave RADAR can penetrate certain non-metallic objects, meaning that multiple line-of-sight objects can sometimes be detected, a property which can be exploited in mobile robot navigation in outdoor unstructured environments. This paper describes a new approach in predicting RADAR range bins which is essential for simultaneous localisation and map building (SLAM) with millimetre wave RADAR. The first contribution of this paper is a SLAM formulation using an augmented state vector which includes the normalised RADAR cross sections (RCS) and absorption cross sections of features as well as the usual feature Cartesian coordinates. The term \"normalised\" is used as the actual RCS is incorporated into a reflectivity parameter. Normalisation results as it is assumed that the sum of this reflectivity parameter and the absorption and transmittance parameters is unity. This is carried out to provide feature rich representations of the environment to significantly aid the data association process in SLAM. The second contribution is a predictive model of the power-range spectra (often referred to as range bins), from differing vehicle locations, for multiple line-of-sight targets. This forms a predicted power-range observation, based on estimates of the augmented SLAM state. The formulation of power returns from multiple objects down-range is derived and predicted RADAR range spectra are compared with real spectra, recorded outdoors. This prediction of power-range spectra is a step towards a full, RADAR based SLAM framework.",

        "abstract": "A wireless capsule endoscope, M2A, has been developed to replace the conventional endoscope. However, the commercialized capsule endoscope moves passively by peristaltic waves and gravity, which has some limitations for doctors to diagnose more thoroughly and actively. In order to solve this problem, a locomotive mechanism is proposed for a wireless capsule endoscope. Based on the tests of various actuators, a piezoactuator is selected as a microactuator for the capsule endoscope. Piezoactuators are known to have limited displacement with high voltage supply. In order to overcome the limitation of common piezoactuator, the impact based piezoactuator is developed to realize long stroke up to 11 mm. Moreover, clampers mimicked the claw of insects are employed. A prototype of the earthworm-like locomotive mechanism integrated with an impact based piezoactuator and engraved clampers is developed. It has 15 mm in diameter and 30 mm under retraction stage and 41 mm under elongation stage in total length. Hollow space is allocated to comprise essential endoscope components such as a camera, communication module, battery, and biosensors. For the feasibility test of proposed locomotive mechanism, a series of experiments was carried out including in-vitro tests. Based on results of the experiments, we conclude that the proposed locomotive mechanism is effective to be used for microcapsule endoscopes.",

Recognizing affective states from physiological cues is an effective way of implementing implicit human-robot interaction. Several machine learning techniques have been successfully employed in affect-recognition to predict the affective state of an individual given a set of physiological features. However, a systematic comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of these methods has not yet been done. In this paper we present a comparative study of four machine learning methods - k-nearest neighbor, regression tree, Bayesian network and support vector machine as applied to the domain of affect recognition using physiological signals. The results showed that support vector machine gave the best classification accuracy even though all the methods performed competitively. Regression tree gave the next best classification accuracy and was the most space and time efficient.",

The position/force virtual mapping method is implemented in the single-master dual-slave tele-micromanipulation system to realize the human-robot cooperative internal force regulation while grasping task. The generated reference trajectories of both manipulators by the virtual mapping method are shared with the cooperative impedance control of multi-slaves to regulate the internal force while grasping an object.

We show that by analyzing limit sets directly we can design parts and their environment so that part feeding or assembling naturally emerges from the dynamics.

Torque perturbations can be individually applied to any or all seven joints of the human arm, thus creating novel dynamic environments, or force fields, for subjects to respond and adapt to. Our first study investigates a joint space force field where the shoulder velocity drives a disturbing force in the elbow joint. Results demonstrate that subjects learn to compensate for the force field within about 100 trials, and, from the strong presence of aftereffects when removing the field in some randomized catch trials, that an inverse dynamics, or internal model, of the force field is formed by the nervous system. Interestingly, while after learning, hand trajectories return to baseline, joint space trajectories remained changed in response to the field, indicating that, besides learning a model of the force field, the nervous system also chose to exploit the null space to minimize the effects of the force field on the realization of the endpoint trajectory plan. We discuss applications of these results in the light of current theories of robotic control, including inverse kinematics and optimal control.",

The proposed algorithm is based on image-based visual servoing (IBVS) using only one camera in conjunction with a flat mirror. A landmark mounted on the robot along with its mirror reflection, when viewed by the camera, provides enough information for 3D reasoning based on a 2D image. The governing equations describing the relationship between the robot's velocity and rate of change in image features are fully described. Furthermore, a methodology for on-line estimation of the image Jacobian with no camera calibration is developed. Simulation and experimental results illustrate the robustness of the proposed visual servoing structure.",

Starting from our previous method for fault detection and isolation (FDI) based on generalized momenta, fault identification is additionally obtained through the H/sub /spl infin//-design of a state observer for uncertain systems. For each separate fault channel, the identifier consists of a linear filter driven by the corresponding residual signal. Under the weak assumption of bounded time derivative for the otherwise unknown fault input to be identified, the fault estimation error is shown to be ultimately uniformly bounded, with ultimate bound that can be set arbitrarily small. The information on the type and severity of the fault may then be used for reconfiguring the control strategy. Experimental results on a 2R planar manipulator are presented.",

During the real-time planning, each arm represents a dynamic obstacle for another one, which allows to treat the motion of the latter, as well as the motion of other objects in the workspace in a unified fashion. The motion for each arm is planned independently, and the only information which is \"shared\" is the intended configuration of each robot. The approach relies therefore exclusively on the dynamic, explorative path generation, which is performed using the dynamic wave expansion neural network. Our simulative experiments for the case of two robot arms with 3-DOFs in 3D reveal that the proposed approach, without any complicated heuristics, any priority assignment, and any global optimization of an objective cost function, is capable of producing feasible paths \"on-the-fly\". The robustness and efficiency of the method are demonstrated statistically through a number of random tests.",

The wing-box has a large span, but is only accessible through multiple small portholes along its length. The arm should be compact enough to enter the wing-box through the small portholes, yet capable of subsequent reconfiguration so as to access a number of assembly points inside the wing-box. Traditional electromechanical actuators powering individual joints are unsuitable for our purpose, because of limited space and large payload requirements. We propose an underactuated system which uses a single actuator at the base for the deployment of a multi d.o.f. serial linkage structure. Our proposed system exploits gravitational and gyroscopic torques in the system dynamics to rapidly deploy the system. We develop a methodology for determining the input required for a desired output trajectory and verify the results through simulation.",

        "abstract": "It is important to identify how much the appearance of a humanoid robot affects human behaviors toward it. We compared participants' impressions of and behaviors toward two real humanoid robots in simple human-robot interaction. These two robots have different appearances but are controlled to perform the same recorded utterances and motions, which are adjusted by using a motion capturing system. We conducted an experiment where 48 human participants participated. In the experiment, participants interacted with the two robots one by one and also with a human as a reference. As a result, we found that the different appearances did not affect the participants' verbal behaviors but did affect their non-verbal behaviors such as distance and delay of response. These differences are explained by two factors, impressions and attributions.",

Generating chopper gun trajectories for free-form surfaces to satisfy the given requirements is still highly challenging due to the complex geometry of free-form surfaces and the spray gun model. A CAD-guided chopper gun trajectory generation system for both uniform and nonuniform material distribution of free-form surfaces has been developed in our previous work. A material distribution model is also presented. To verify the developed algorithms, experiments were performed. In this paper, the experimental results are presented and compared with the simulation results. The results demonstrate that the developed trajectory generation system can be applied to generate trajectories for free-form surfaces such that the material distribution requirements can be satisfied. Also, the material distribution model can be used to compute the material distribution for free-form surfaces. This trajectory generation method can also be applied to generate trajectories for many other CAD-guided robot trajectory planning applications.",

Early and intelligent faults detection and diagnosis (FDD) of such systems can prevent failure of devices that causes shutdown and loss of precious production time and profits. In this paper, we introduce analytical FDD for pneumatic systems. The diagnosis system presented in this paper focuses on the signal-based approach which employs multi-resolution wavelet decomposition of various sensor signals such as pressure, flow rate, etc., to determine leak configuration. Pattern recognition technique and analytical vectorized maps are developed to diagnose an unknown leakage based on the established FDD information using affine mapping. Experimental studies and analysis are presented to illustrate the FDD system.",

The somatotopic organization inside the ventral horn of the spinal cord is utilized for topological structure of the spinal neural information. Time series of images which represent distribution of somatic information inside the spinal cord were successfully obtained through measurement and computation for sword swinging 'kesagiri' motion.

A robot manipulator is used to generate common interaction motions, and human subjects are asked to report their response to the motions. The human physiological response is also measured. Motion paths are generated using a classic potential field planner and a safe motion planner, which minimizes the potential collision force along the path. A fuzzy inference engine is developed to estimate the human response based on the physiological measures. Results show that emotional arousal can be detected using physiological signals and the inference engine. Comparison of initial results between the two planners shows that subjects report less anxiety and surprise with the safe planner for high planner speeds.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, an appearance-based environment modelling technique is presented. Based on this approach, the probabilistic Bayesian inference can work together with symbolic topological map to re-localize a mobile robot. One prominent advantage offered by this algorithm is that, it can be applied to cross-country environment where no features or landmarks are available. Furthermore, the loop-closing can be detected independent of estimated map and vehicle location. High dimensional laser measurements are projected into a low dimensional space (mapspace) which describes the appearance of the environment. Since laser scans from the same region share the similar appearance, after the projection, they are expected to form a distinct cluster in the low dimensional space. This small cluster essentially encodes the appearance information of the specific region in the environment, and it can be approximated by a Gaussian distribution. This Gaussian model can serve as the 'joint' between the topological map structure and the probabilistic Bayesian inference. By employing such 'joints', the Bayesian inference in the metric level can be conveniently implemented on topological level. Based on appearance, the proposed inference process is thus completely independent of local metric features. Extensive experiments were conducted using a tracked vehicle travelling in an open jungle environments. Results from live runs verified the feasibility of the proposed methods to detect loop-closing. The performances are also given and thoroughly analyzed.",

The measurements are taken from a low-cost SMU (inertial measurement unit) which consists of 3-axis accelerometers and 3-axis gyroscopes. The gyro bias are estimated online. A second nonlinear complimentary filter (z-estimator) is also designed, it combines 3-axis gyroscope readings with 3-axis magnetometer measurements. From the proposed estimators, the full rotation matrix R will be retrieved. Both estimators use the fact that the orientation matrix, evolving on SO(3), is not locally parameterized and thus could be used to describe any kind of 3D motion. Convergence of the two observers is theoretically proved and simulations as well as experiments are conducted on a real platform in hovering flight conditions.",

Binaural information such as interaural time difference (ITD) or interaural intensity difference(IID) is effective for horizontal sound localization. In order to extend this ability to vertical sound localization, spectral cues were utilized in this paper instead of increasing number of microphones. Spectral cues were the information about the vertical position of the sound source on frequency domain. Since spectral cues strongly depended on the shape of pinnae, artificial pinnae for auditory robots were designed based on diffraction-reflection model. A method to detect spectral cues was also developed. By utilizing them, a controller which made the robot orient to the sound source was proposed. Results of an experiment showed the validity of the proposed method.",

The system, with the use of an Elman type recurrent neural network (RNN), is able to dynamically track this sound source as it changes azimuthally within the environment. The RNN is used to enable fast tracking responses to the overall system over a set time, as opposed to waiting for the next sound position before moving. The system is first tested in a simulated environment and then these results are compared with testing on the robotic system. The results show that the development of a hybrid system incorporating cross-correlation and recurrent neural networks is an effective mechanism for the control of a robot that tracks sound sources azimuthally.",

        "abstract": "This paper propose a new control algorithm for a robotic walker based on augmented variable center of rotation (COR) to adapt to user's controlling characteristics. The new CORs are taken from environment-based training. This is done by allowing the user to use the robotic walker from a start point to a goal point in a training environment and path following algorithm is employed. The user's intention represented by applied force/torque is logged during training. The logged data is segmented to correspond to the straight and curve segments in the training environment. This data is used to regenerate the path of the robotic walker. The error between the regenerated and the desired path is taken and in case a large path error exists, an optimization program is used to change the COR until the sum of the square of the path error is minimized. This approach refers to an offline COR determination. A variable COR controller as a function of applied torque is designed based on the new CORs. This is augmented and used in the actual control of the robotic walker. The proposed control algorithm was experimentally implemented and results show its validity.",

A ranking methodology is proposed, based on which the 18 focus algorithms are ranked.

        "abstract": "Common software design practices use object-oriented (OO) frameworks that structure software in terms of objects, classes, and packages; designers then create programs by inheritance and composition of classes and objects. Operational software components for advanced robotics (OSCAR) is one such framework for robot control software with abstractions for generalized kinematics, dynamics, performance criteria, decision making, and hardware interfacing. Even with OSCAR, writing new programs still requires a significant amount of manual labor. Feature-oriented programming (FOP) is method for software design that models and specifies programs in terms of features, where a feature encapsulates the common design decisions that occur in a domain. A set of features then forms a domain model for a product line architecture. Product variants in this product line can then be generated from a declarative specification. FOP and related technologies are emerging software engineering techniques for automatically generating programs. Our research applies FOP to robot controller software. As an example, the domain of hardware interfacing is analyzed and 41 features identified. A GUI for specifying and generating programs is presented as well. Analysis of features shows 200 possible different programs could be generated.",

        "abstract": "To keep autonomous mobile robot in continuously working condition, power supply is an important issue. Typically, rechargeable batteries may provide few hours of peak usage. Recharging is necessary before the power of the batteries has exhausted. In this paper, the docking station with an auto-recharging device and robot docking mechanism are implemented. We propose a docking control strategy and automatic recharging device for the security robot recharging. We also propose a power prediction algorithm to determine when the robot needs to navigate back to docking station for recharging. An artificial landmark is detected and recognized by the proposed image processing system. Then the geometrical relationship between the robot and the docking station (the depth and orientation) is estimated. The robot will move directly right in front of the docking station. Finally, the robot approaches to the docking station based on the proposed virtual spring model. In this model, we assume that the robot and the docking station are connected by a virtual spring. The compliant forces act both in the direction of the translation deformation and bending. The motion control parameters, which are velocities of the two wheels, can be derived from the model. Experimental results show that the proposed methods successfully perform the docking and automatic recharging.",

In this paper, we introduce a simulation platform for generation of visual servoing tasks as well as a new method for automatic selection of object features. This method considers several aspects related to the robustness of the tracking system to select features which ensure optimal performance of the robot control system. Finally, we present experiments which compare the performance of a visual servoing system employing the proposed feature planning technique to that of a servoing system based on features selected using traditional methods. These experiments demonstrate that our technique not only improves the robustness of the visual tracking system but also significantly increases the accuracy of the visual servoing control loop.",

Results indicate that if parameter values are chosen within reasonable ranges, then the flight controller works quite well even when subject to disturbances along the generated flight path.",

        "abstract": "Through the use of a virtual trailer link model, autonomous vehicle following capabilities have been demonstrated. The principle is based on the modelling of the trailer link, used in the off-hooked trailer system, as a virtual link between the leading and led vehicles. The leader vehicle is modelled as the tractor (towing vehicle) and the follower vehicle as the trailer (towed vehicle). This method enables our autonomous vehicle to follows the estimated trajectory of the virtual trailer, which is predicted from observations of the maneuvers of the lead vehicle. Unlike conventional methods, in our system, neither communication links between two vehicles nor the installation of special road infrastructures are needed for the implementation. Communication system may failed and the installation of road infrastructures are costly. We show that system response of the virtual trailer link model is much smoother. A series of simulations and experimental results have indicated the validity of the proposed method.",

We first develop an optimal placement algorithm based on the mosaic technique inspired by the retina mosaic pattern widely observed in both human and many animal visual systems. Different types of mobile sensors are organized into a mosaic pattern to maximize sensing coverage and to reduce network cost. Secondly, in order to converge to the optimal state, we investigate the swarm intelligence (SI)-based sensor movement strategy with the assistance of local communications, through which the randomly deployed sensors can self-organize themselves to reach the optimal placement state. The proposed algorithm is compared with the random movement and the SI-based method without direct communication using performance metrics such as sensing coverage, redundancy, convergence time, and energy consumption. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the mosaic placement and the SI-based movement with local communication.",

In this paper, it is shown that a biped robot with torso can walk efficiently on level ground over a wide range of speed by using torso and swing leg control based on passive-dynamic walking. A torso is used to generate active power replacing gravity, proposed by McGeer. The biped robot can exhibit a stable gait not planed in advance, and a period-doubling bifurcation is demonstrated in numerical simulations. Furthermore, when we choose carefully a swing leg control gain, a reverse period-doubling bifurcation from chaotic gaits to period-one gaits is demonstrated, which is not found in the passive-dynamic walking.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a new design approach of bipedal walking pattern based on the synchronization of the motions in sagittal and lateral planes are presented and two walking patterns of ZMP fixed and ZMP variable cases are developed. Based on our previous work, bipedal walking is separated into the initial acceleration, double support, deceleration, and acceleration phases; consequently, the nature that bipedal walking is in fact a continuous acceleration and deceleration motion is revealed. With the discusses on the motions both in the sagittal and lateral planes, the fact that the motions in these two planes are tightly coupled together is clarified. The motion parameters such as the walking velocity, walking time, and phase stride can be easily changed simply by altering the swinging amplitude in lateral plane that is determined by the double support phase. The constraint conditions of the phase stride, velocity and swinging amplitude are investigated. Therefore, an approach for adjusting walking velocity by controlling the swinging amplitude is naturally developed. The motion planning is also presented and a numerical example is given out.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we address a blind decomposition problem of binaural mixed signals observed at the ears of humanoid robot, and we introduce a novel blind signal decomposition algorithm using single-input multiple-output-model-based ICA (SIMO-ICA). The SIMO-ICA consists of multiple ICAs and a fidelity controller, and each ICA runs in parallel under the fidelity control of the entire separation system. The SIMO-ICA can separate the mixed signals, not into monaural source signals but into SIMO-model-based signals from independent sources as they are at the microphones in the robot ear. Thus, the separated signals of SIMO-ICA can maintain the spatial qualities of each sound source, i.e., they represent the decomposed sound scenes. Obviously the attractive feature of SIMO-ICA is highly applicable to not only speech recognition but also, e.g., humanoid-robot-based auditory tele-existence technology. The experimental results reveal that the spatial quality of the separated sound in SIMO-ICA is remarkably superior to that of the conventional method, particularly for the fidelity of the sound reproduction.",

A technique for the optimal velocity planning, to be used that framework, is proposed in this paper. Differentiable velocity profiles, which fulfil assigned initial and final boundary conditions on the velocity itself and on its first derivative, are obtained by means of the proposed strategy. Moreover, profiles are constrained between assigned bounds, i.e. velocity is limited, and its second derivative (the longitudinal jerk) is minimized by means of an optimization algorithm. The extensive use of closed form expressions makes this approach suitable to be implemented in real-time applications.",

We view each robot system as a collection of processes that need to exchange information, e.g. motion commands and sensory data, in a flexible and convenient fashion, without affecting each other's operations in case of a process's scheduled termination or unexpected failure. We argue that the IPC technology provides an ideal framework for this purpose, and we carefully make our design decisions about its implementation based on the needs of robotics applications. Broker is programming language, operating system, and hardware platform independent and has served us well in a RoboCup project and collective robotics experiments, in both simulation and real-world environments.",

In this paper we present a service discovery protocol that allows robots to efficiently discover available services in the network. It is specifically designed for large-scale robot networks. It takes into account the high dynamics of robot networks and exploits the position data of the robots to increase scalability and efficiency. A cell-based grid with master nodes in each cell forms the basic structure. Through proactive intra-cell communication and reactive inter-cell communication, scalability is ensured and the effects of node movements on the overall network are minimized.

The proposed algorithm is suitable for system that demands very high localization accuracy such as an intelligent robot vacuum cleaner. A single camera looking upward direction (called ceiling vision system) is mounted on the robot, and salient image features are detected and tracked through the image sequence. Compared with the conventional frontal view systems, the ceiling vision has advantage in tracking, since it involves only rotation and affine transform without scale change. And, in this paper, we solve the rotation and affine transform problems using 3D gradient orientation estimation method and multi-view description of landmarks. By applying these methods to the solution for data association, we can reconstruct the 3D landmark map in real-time through the extend Kalman filter based SLAM framework. Furthermore, relocation problem is solved efficiently by using a wide base line matching between the reconstructed 3D map and a 2D ceiling image. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm in real environments.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a straightforward process for calibrating an active vision system containing both pinhole perspective and omnidirectional cameras. The perspective cameras can be easily calibrated using standard methods. Unfortunately, these methods are not suitable for omnidirectional cameras. Methods that rely on iterative least squares optimization, using a set of known image-world correspondences, are adopted for omnidirectional cameras. To ensure unbiased estimation of camera parameters, an omnidirectional calibration rig is employed so that nearly the entire field of view contains known calibration points. Measurement uncertainties collected from each stage of calibration are then combined to estimate the overall system uncertainty. This calibration process is evaluated experimentally by estimating the location of known points using triangulation, where the results achieved are comparable with the estimated system uncertainties.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Trajectory planning for eye-in-hand visual servoing is usually performed in the Euclidean work space of the robot or in a two dimensional image space. However, planning in Euclidean space may lead to very inappropriate trajectories in image space and vice versa. These difficulties are due to the perspective transformation of the camera, loss of one dimension due to projection onto the image plane and the fact that only a rough approximation of camera parameters is practically available. Hence, this paper proposes a planning scheme for image trajectories such that straight line behaviour is ensured both in image space and world space, ie. a single but arbitrarily chosen point in the image plane performs straight line behaviour as well as the camera optical center in work space. This way, trajectories become very compact and most of the above mentioned problems are avoided in a natural way. The algorithm requires as a priori information nothing more than matched image points (in pixels) from a current and desired image and a depth set for at least one position.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a new method to automatically calibrate lens distortion of wide-angle lenses. We project structured-light patterns using a flat display to generate a map between the display and the image coordinate systems. This approach has two advantages. First, it is easier to take correspondences of image and marker (display) coordinates around the edge of a camera image than using a usual marker, e.g. a checker board. Second, since we can easily construct a dense map, a simple linear interpolation is enough to create an undistorted image. Our method is not restricted by the distortion parameters because it directly generates the map. We have evaluated the accuracy of our method and the error becomes smaller than results by parameter fitting.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents new calibration methods for a robotic area sensing system developed for industrial manufacturing inspection. A pixel-to-pixel calibration scheme is introduced to obtain standoff and baseline distance of the developed area sensor. In the three-dimensional (3D) space, the area sensor also has an offset angle in a plane parallel to the reference plane. Calibration of this offset angle improves the measurement accuracy. This pixel-to-pixel scheme is particularly useful for calibrating a 3D optical area sensor with off-the-shelf lenses. An exploding vector method was also developed to transform the measured depth map to a 3D point cloud. A robotic area sensing system was developed by integrating an area sensor prototype and a robot sensor planning system. Calibration of the integrated system includes robot calibration, part calibration, and robot hand-eye calibration. Calibration error of the robot system is related to the area sensor positioning accuracy in the robotic system. Experimental results show a successful practice of the developed robotic area sensing system. Measurement performance of the developed system can be improved if advanced lenses are adopted.",

Secondly, the first-layer sliding surface and one of the left states are used to construct the second-layer sliding surface. This process continues till the last-layer sliding surface is obtained. By theoretical analysis, the cascade sliding-mode controller is proved to be globally stable in the sense that all signals involved are bounded.

Opportunity and Spirit, the current pair of MER (Mars Exploration Rovers) on Mars for over a year, have both discovered evidence of past surface water. Optimal use of mission resources, such as ground planning time and surface operation duration, for increased science data return becomes critical with each advancement in the capabilities of the onboard instrument suites. This paper presents a novel, end-to-end, fully integrated system being developed at JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory) that is called SCAIP (Single Command Approach and Instrument Placement). SCAIP enables a rover to autonomously travel to a designated science target from an extended distance away, and precisely place an instrument on that target with a single command without additional human interaction. The results of some experimental studies with a rover in terrestrial settings and using imagery returned from MER are also described.",

        "abstract": "This study aims at establishing a new control strategy for more natural and efficient bipedal locomotion. In this study, the robot is modeled as a planar biped model composed of a torso, hips, and two different legs with knees, but without ankles. The proposed method consists of central pattern generator (CPG) for legged locomotion and torso attitude control. It is well known that the CPG controller copes with environmental changes by mutual entrainment of the oscillatory activities of the CPG and the body. Therefore, the biped robot can walk on both a level ground and a slope, and has the robustness for environmental changes. Moreover, the torso attitude control is executed concurrently with CPG controller for legged locomotion in the method. By utilizing the interaction between torso and legs, the biped robot with the torso can walk on the level ground over a wide range of speed. This paper presents a systematic control design method of the proposed strategy by using the genetic algorithm. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, computational simulations were carried out. As a result, it was demonstrated that the biped robot can walk on the level ground at a variable pace according to the desired torso angle given as an external command. Moreover, it was confirmed that the proposed controller has the robustness for environmental changes and external disturbance, and the biped robot can walk naturally on the uphill and downhill slopes.",

We show that the combination of stereo and optic flow (stereo flow) is more effective at navigating urban canyons than either technique alone. Optic flow from a pair of sideways looking cameras is used to stay centered in a canyon and initiate turns at junctions, while stereo vision from a forward facing stereo head is used to avoid obstacles to the front. The technique was tested in full on an autonomous tractor at CSIRO and in part on the USC autonomous helicopter. Experimental results are presented from these two robotic platforms operating in outdoor environments. We show that the autonomous tractor can navigate urban canyons using stereo-flow, and that the autonomous helicopter can turn away from obstacles to the side using optic flow. In addition, preliminary results show that a single pair of forward facing fisheye cameras can be used for both stereo and optic flow. The center portions of the fisheye images are used for stereo, while flow is measured in the periphery of the images.",

In this research, a command system to describe the navigation task for an omni-directional mobile robot is developed, and a motion generation method considering the robot geometry and the given trajectory is proposed. Furthermore, a control method to track the given linear and circular trajectories is proposed. A closed form kinematic model was utilized for motion generation and control as well. A redundantly actuated omni-directional mobile robot that consists of three caster-type wheel mechanisms with high performance embedded controller module was developed for the experiments. And some experiments in the real environment were carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed command system and the performance of the motion generation and the trajectory control method.",

        "abstract": "Forceps manipulating robots have been developed for assisting surgeons to realize high-quality and precise operation in laparoscopic surgery. Currently several commercially available systems greatly contributed to operations. Still their large size causes problems in the operating theater, thus they need to be miniaturized. We developed a new compact forceps manipulator. It consists of two parts; friction wheel mechanism which rotates and translates the forceps (62/spl times/52/spl times/150[mm/sup 3/], 0.6[kg]), and gimbals mechanism which drives the forceps around the incision hole on the abdomen to determine the direction of forceps (135/spl times/165/spl times/300[mm/sup 3/], 1.1[kg]). Thus, the four DOF motion of forceps in laparoscopic surgery was realized. Ultrasonic motor was adopted for actuating friction wheel mechanism because of its small size, high torque and cleanliness. We controlled the manipulator in semi-closed loop using rotary encoders. Mechanical evaluation results showed that feedback loop control and compensation of control command improved the positioning accuracy. Positioning accuracy of the gimbals mechanism was less than 0.6 [deg], and that of friction wheel mechanism was less than 0.2 [mm] in translation and 1 [deg] in rotation. In vitro experiment simulating usage in the clinical environment revealed that this manipulator realized stable motion even if the liquid materials such as blood attached onto the forceps. The new manipulator was promising and useful in laparoscopic surgery.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the principles of motor coordination with redundant degrees of freedom still remains a challenging problem, particularly for new research in highly redundant robots like humanoids. Even after more than a decade of research, task space control with redundacy resolution still remains an incompletely understood theoretical topic, and also lacks a larger body of thorough experimental investigation on complex robotic systems. This paper presents our first steps towards the development of a working redundancy resolution algorithm which is robust against modeling errors and unforeseen disturbances arising from contact forces. To gain a better understanding of the pros and cons of different approaches to redundancy resolution, we focus on a comparative empirical evaluation. First, we review several redundancy resolution schemes at the velocity, acceleration and torque levels presented in the literature in a common notational framework and also introduce some new variants of these previous approaches. Second, we present experimental comparisons of these approaches on a seven-degree-of-freedom anthropomorphic robot arm. Surprisingly, one of our simplest algorithms empirically demonstrates the best performance, despite, from a theoretical point, the algorithm does not share the same beauty as some of the other methods. Finally, we discuss practical properties of these control algorithms, particularly in light of inevitable modeling errors of the robot dynamics.",

By employing dual CCD cameras onboard, the instant pose of UAV can be determined without any use of expensive sensor like gyro. The unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is hereafter introduced to resolve the highly nonlinear system dynamics as well as the measurement process of the pose estimation system. The only measurements recorded are those snapshots of ground targets/landmarks taken by two CCD cameras. The proposed scenario can also detect large angle rotation of UAV. Simulation is conducted via a simple case, both UAV and ground targets are stationary, to show the feasibility and applicability of the proposed scheme. Actual GPS measurement data of ground targets coordinates was recorded for UKF processing. A highlight phenomenon, implied by simulation, reveals that a sudden transition of estimation errors arises at the epoch when the UAV is experiencing a large angle maneuvering up to 180/spl deg/ per second.",

More specifically, every single joint is assumed to be equipped with a simple local processing unit for properly driving its motion. As a consequence, each joint and the associated link may be considered as a defective \"1-dof only\" separately controlled atomic manipulator, which is required to act in team with all the other joints in order to accomplish a global common task specified in the operational space. In this context, the paper proposes a computationally distributed kinematic inversion technique that, via the on-line application of a dynamic programming technique (based on a moderate data exchange among the processing units), allows the establishment of a global self-organizing behavior; thus allowing to optimally execute the task by solely exploiting the control capabilities of each local processing unit, while not requiring any centralized knowledge about the overall arm geometry and kinematics.",

First, CML is formulated as a multidimensional informed search problem. The search is performed to detect a robot pose which can best accommodate the recent sensor scan in the currently available map. A fuzzy set theoretic approach is used to predict a sample based representation of the state space of possible robot poses and a GA is designed to find out the globally optimal solution from the predicted pose space. The GA evaluates the fitness of poses based on the sensory information and drives the generation gradually towards the globally optimal solution even when the fuzzy prediction is inaccurate. The best fit solution as decided by GA offers the most likely continuation of the currently available map. Experiment on synthetic and real data illustrates the robustness of the algorithm.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we constructed wireless ad hoc network for realizing various physical and informational support systems based on Lifelog that is the records of experiences in the daily life, and realized a prototype of electric appliances operational support system which is one of useful systems. Utilization of Lifelog reduces the burden for controlling a huge amount of convoluted electric appliances by constructing the probabilistic model of user's operational behavior based on Lifelog and predicting user's successive operations with this model. In this time, Lifelog accumulates user's operational behavior for electric appliances and environmental information through the wireless network. For the basis of collecting Lifelog including operational behavior, we made a portable Bluetooth-equipped device for wireless network which is necessary to communicate information in the ubiquitous computing environment because Bluetooth has good features such as the ad hoc networking function, sufficient data throughput, high resistance to noise and low power consumption. The realized device has abundant 110 connectors which are able to connect various sensors and actuators. By attaching these devices to electric appliances, they can easily participate in the wireless network and communicate information. Therefore the system can probabilistically model user's behavior, especially operations for electric appliances using Lifelog as training data, and predicts the user's next successive operations for surrounding appliances utilizing this model and the user's present state. The system gives prediction results to the user and executes operations via the wireless network after the user's confirmation. The various experimental results prove that the operational system in ubiquitous computing environment is useful and our realized device is sufficient performance in the daily life.",

We establish the dynamics model of contact and impact between a space manipulator and FFT. The pre-impact, post-impact effect and condition of the space robot system and the FFT system are analyzed when there are any differences between the speed of the end-effector of the space manipulator and that of the contact and impact point on the surface of FFT. We present the relationship between the speed varieties of the space base and that of the FFT. If the impact force is kept constant, the speed varieties of the space base are different when the space robot system is at different configuration. Those methods can be used to analyze the contact and impact problem of the space robot.",

The cell based actuator utilizes glucose as a power source and thus can apply to the application of a human body or blood vessels. For the structural design of the cell based micro-robot, the contractile force of the muscle powered by cardiac myocytes should be measured. In addition, the contractile force measurement can be used in the static or dynamic simulations of the micro-robot. In this paper, the contractile force measurement system, which is composed of a micro-manipulator, a force transducer, a signal processor and an inverted microscope is proposed. By using the measuring system, the contractile force for both control and micro-patterned cardiac myocytes are measured. From the experimental results, we estimated that the contractile force of cardiac myocytes is about 20-40 /spl mu/N when it is compared between the control cell and the cell on micro-pattern.",

Information of multiple fishes' position and orientation, with real-time visual tracking, is then obtained for positioning in the coordinate experiment. The coordinated motions of the fishes are achieved by behavior-based strategies composed of role assignment, behavior selection and role transition. An experimental system for multiple robotic fishes' coordination is finally constructed to verify the proposed scheme and algorithms, and the running experiments of passing-hole and pushing-ball primarily show the effectiveness of the presented strategies.",

        "abstract": "For assisting human motion, assistive devices working as muscles would be useful. A robot suit HAL (hybrid assistive limb) has been developed as an assistive device for lower limbs. Human can appropriately produce muscle contraction torque and control joint viscoelasticity by muscle effort such as co-contraction. Thus, to implement functions equivalent to human muscles using HAL, it is necessary to control viscoelasticity of HAL as well as to produce torque in accordance with operator's intention. Therefore the purpose of this study is to propose a control method of HAL using biological and motion information. In this method, HAL produces torque corresponding to muscle contraction torque by referring to the myoelectricity that is biological information to control operator's muscles. In addition, the viscoelasticities of HAL are adjusted in proportion to operator's viscoelasticity that is estimated from motion information by using an on-line parameter identification method. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the method was applied to a swinging motion of a lower leg. When this method was applied, HAL could work like operator's muscles in the swinging motion, and as a consequence, the muscle activities of the operator were reduced. As a result of this experiment, we confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

In opposition to a standard camera which provides a projection of the 3D scene to a 2D image, ultrasound information is strictly in the observation plan of the probe and consequently visual servoing techniques have to be adapted. In this paper the coupling between the ultrasound probe and a motionless crossed string phantom used for probe calibration is modeled. Then a robotic task is developed which consists to position the ultrasound image on the intersection point of the crossed string phantom while moving the probe to different orientations. The goal of this task is to optimize the procedure of spatial parameters calibration of 3D ultrasound systems.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel real-time EMG pattern recognition for the control of a multifunction myoelectric hand from four channel EMG signals. To cope with the nonstationary signal property of the EMG, features are extracted by wavelet packet transform. For dimensionality reduction and nonlinear mapping of the features, we also propose a linear-nonlinear feature projection composed of PCA and SOFM. The dimensionality reduction by PCA simplifies the structure of the classifier, and reduces processing time for the pattern recognition. The nonlinear mapping by SOFM transforms the PCA-reduced features to a new feature space with high class separability. Finally a multilayer neural network is employed as the pattern classifier. We implement a real-time control system for a multifunction myoelectric hand. From experimental results, we show that all processes, including myoelectric hand control, are completed within 125 msec, and the proposed method is applicable to real-time myoelectric hand control without an operation time delay.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method to cooperatively localize pairs of robots fusing bearing-only information provided by cameras and the motion of the vehicles. The algorithm uses the robots as landmarks to estimate their relative location. Bearings are the simplest measurements directly obtained from the cameras, as opposed to measuring depths which would require knowledge or reconstruction of the world structure. We present the general recursive Bayes estimator and three different implementations based on an extended Kalman filter, a particle filter and a combination of both techniques. We have compared the performance of the different implementations using real data acquired with two platforms equipped with omnidirectional cameras and simulated data.",

        "abstract": "We describe a method for estimating the relative poses of a team of mobile robots using only acoustic sensing. The relative distances and bearing angles of the robots are estimated using the time of arrival of audible sound signals on stereo microphones. The robots emit specially designed sound waveforms that simultaneously enable robot identification and time of arrival estimation. These acoustic observations are then combined with odometry to update a belief state describing the positions and heading angles of all the robots. To efficiently resolve the ambiguity in the heading angle of the observing robot as well as the back-front ambiguity of the observed robot, we employ a Rao-Blackwellised particle filter (RBPF) where the distribution over heading angles is represented by a discrete set of particles, and the uncertainty in the translational positions conditioned on each of these particles is described by a Gaussian. This approach combines the representational accuracy of conventional particle filters with the efficiency of Kalman filter updates in modeling the pose distribution over a number of robots. We demonstrate how the RBPF can quickly resolve uncertainties in the binaural acoustic measurements and yield a globally consistent pose estimate. Simulations as well as an experimental implementation on robots with generic sound hardware illustrate the accuracy and the convergence of the resulting pose estimates.",

It is an extension to our research on covert robotics which aims to create robots with the ability to achieve different covert navigation missions. A promising method is presented that allows a mobile robot in a complex, initially unknown environment to discover a path to a nominated destination with minimum exposure to sentries' at known locations within the same environment. The sentries' locations are known initially, suspected, or discovered during navigation. The presented method estimates a cost value at each non-obstacle location that represents a risk of being visible, given the accumulated map knowledge. A global covert path is generated by propagating the estimated cost values using the distance transform algorithm. The approach has been evaluated on both simulated and real environments. A number of test cases are presented; each shows a generated path with considerable covertness compared to a short path (but perhaps risky) to the same destination.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a method based on the probabilistic roadmap (PRM) planner to construct robust roadmaps for motion planning in changing environments. PRM's are usually aimed at static environments. In reality though, many environments are not static, but contain moving obstacles as well. Often the motion of these obstacles is not unconstrained, but is restricted to some confined area, e.g. a door that can be open or closed or a chair which is bounded to a room. We exploit this observation by assuming that a moving obstacle has a predefined set of potential placements. We present a variant of PRM that is robust against placement changes of obstacles. Our method creates a roadmap that is guaranteed to contain a path for any feasible query when time goes to infinity, i.e. the method is probabilistically complete. Our implementation shows that after a roadmap is created in the preprocessing phase, queries can be solved instantaneously, thus allowing for on-the-fly replanning to anticipate changes in the environment.",

The force model is proposed by theoretic analysis of the cutting force between dental tools and tooth. A damping matrix is developed for obtaining a unified formulation for all components of cutting forces. All factors that affect the cutting force are considered in the model by including a number of parameters. These parameters are identified by tooth-cut experiments, which measure the cutting force with a six-dimensional force sensor. A prototype system of haptic simulation is developed to test the model. Dentists performing virtual operation on the system have confirmed the realistic sense of cutting force.",

Watching a video showing the performance of dance masters is one of the most effective ways of learning dances. However, it is difficult for dance beginners to obtain useful information well only by watching video. They can hardly know timing information and the amount of translation. Although we can tell how to move our arms or legs from video, it is difficult to know when to start moving them. In addition, they cannot obtain translational motion, especially that in the depth direction (how far the dancers move forward or backward). We solve the first issue by developing active devices. The active devices consist of some vibro-motors and are designed to direct action-starting cues with vibration. Concerning the second issue, the image display on a mobile robot is introduced into the system. We can learn the amount of translation just by following the robot. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Sensor networks are attracting attention in several fields. However, the feasibility of such networks faces several challenges, two of which are data fusion and error reduction. This paper presents data fusion and high level error correction algorithms for sensor networks. These algorithms are scalable and general, and thus can be applied to networks of any size using any type of sensors. The data fusion procedure developed results in significant reduction of data sent without reducing the amount of information provided. This allows for real-time remote monitoring of information across low bandwidth connections such as the Internet. The high level error reduction is accomplished using a probability matrix and results in a significant amount of error elimination. A sensor network capable of tracking object motion is constructed to evaluate the performance of the two algorithms. The experimental results obtained confirmed the theory presented.",

Inspired by the social behaviors of ants, we clearly partition the work for the base station and sensor nodes according to their different functions and capabilities. A near-optimal chain is achieved by using an ant colony optimization method ruing in the base station. The sensor nodes in the network then form a bi-direction chain structure, which is self-adaptive to any minor changes. The simulation results show that the developed AntChain algorithm performs much better than the LEACH and PEGASIS methods, in terms of energy-efficiency, data integrity and life time, when the base station.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Existing task allocation methods for multi-robot generally consider the allocation of a task to a robot as a certain source of reward (real reward). In fact, they ignore the impact of the robots' uncertain behaviors on the solution quality and the obtained reward. In environments where task execution is uncertain, a robot can not know, during the allocation phase, whether it will be able to execute all the tasks that are allocated to it. That's why, in many recent and real applications, as planetary rovers, known task allocation mechanisms seem to be insufficient to provide good solutions in the light of uncertainty. In this paper, we address the problem of multi-robot task allocation for situations where task execution is uncertain. We propose an approach that allows robots to take into account the uncertain execution when they are negotiating the allocation of tasks. We decompose the problem into two stages. In the first stage, each robot locally selects tasks it would like to execute, basing its choice on some criterion. Since the resources consumption is uncertain, a criterion to select tasks can not only be the maximization of the robot's reward. We define a new criterion based on the notion of expected reward that provides a good tread-off between the reward of selected tasks and the chances to completely execute these tasks. The task selection mechanism will be formalized by a Markov decision process that allows maximizing the expected reward. In the second stage, an auctioning mechanism is used to allow robots acting in a decentralized way to coordinate their local choices and to allocate tasks.",

        "abstract": "Cooperative robots have attracted the attention because they allow carrying out of tasks which cannot be done with a single robot. Though cooperative robot dynamics are quite complex to handle, regularly it is necessary to implement a nonlinear dynamics-based controller which guarantees fast tracking. A method for very fast constrained object maneuvering for non redundant rigid cooperative robot manipulators is proposed in this paper. The novelty of our approach lies in the fact that very fast decentralized Cartesian cooperative tracking is obtained without using the model of the robot nor exact knowledge of inverse Jacobian. The model-free sliding PD force controller, driven by second order position/force commuting sliding surfaces, is presented, such that approximate compensation of nonlinear dynamics of each robot arises, and the residual error dynamics is finally cancelled by a chattering-free Cartesian sliding mode to guarantee convergence of position and force tracking errors. Notice that inverse kinematics are avoided by synthesized Cartesian, rather than joint, error sliding surfaces, thus the commuting manifold does not depend on the Jacobian, therefore, the system is robust against Jacobian uncertainty, A simulation study of two cooperative robots manipulating a constrained object shows the expected performance.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for SLAM that makes use of a state vector consisting of quantities that describe the relative locations among features. In contrast to previous relative map strategies, the new state vector is compact and always consists of 2n - 3 elements (in a 2D environment) where n is the number of features in the map. It is also shown that the information from observations can be transformed and grouped into two parts: first one containing the information about the map and the second one containing the information about the robot location relative to the features in the map. Therefore the SLAM can be decoupled into two processes where mapping uses the first part of the transformed observation vector and localization becomes a 3-dimensional estimation problem. It is also shown that the information matrix of the map is exactly sparse, resulting in potential computational savings when an information filter is used for mapping. The new decoupled SLAM algorithm is called D-SLAM and is illustrated using simulation.",

According to the magnetic field model, the variation of flux density with respect to PM-pole parameters can be revealed.

        "abstract": "At the present time, the robotics hand research field is searching for those robots that could imitate the human hand, both in shape and in skill. As another option, some manipulator are developed, even though they do not imitate the human hand, they try to fulfil certain specific tasks with the biggest precision and skill. Some keys to make the robotic hands integrable in any manipulator are: built them lighter, a minimum amount of actuators and a simple sensorial system to simplify its control. The present work will describe the design of the RL1 Hand developed in the Robotic's Lab at the Carlos III University of Madrid. This robotic hand has 3 articulated fingers, which adapt themselves to the object which is being held. The fingers movement and auctioning are made through one direct current motor. The control is done through simple commands and can be sent from any computer, as a string of characters. To prove its ability the RL1 Hand was mounted in a robotic arm, ASIBOT Robot. This arm was developed to help disabled people or people with special needs. The RL1 Hand, its mechanisms, its electronic control and its actuator weight 250gr and they are embodied in the ASIBOT Robot.",

The design is based on an innovative \"hose-in-hose\" concept. Its implementation is novel with respect to previous continuum robot designs in that stiffness and extension, in addition to bending, are actively controlled in each section of the robot. This requires a non-trivial extension of previously proposed kinematic models, and poses challenges for real-time control of the robot. We introduce a tangling/untangling algorithm to map between overall cable lengths and per-section cable lengths. Details of the design and its implementation are presented, along with a summary of real-time control issues and experimental results.",

Our proposed architecture features three key concepts: 1) a reconfigurable mechanical structure; 2) a layered software model; and 3) an end-to-end real-time communication mechanism. Our proposed reconfigurable modular humanoid robot consists of several functional robots such as an arm robot, a mobile robot, and a head robot to realize an effective reconfigurable mechanism for expandability. Depending on many purposes of researchers and users, our reconfigurable modular humanoid robot can be used as some kinds of humanoid robots or as several autonomous functional robots. We design and develop a prototype modular humanoid robot consisting of five functional robots for evaluating our proposed architecture. The results of the experiences show the modular humanoid robot can achieve expandability by our reconfigurable mechanism.",

This paper presents the design of a power management unit for a six legged pneumatic robot that runs at a top speed of 1.11 m/s. The system consists of a main unit that acts as a fast charger, a power supply and a monitor of the energy left available to the robot. This unit communicates with small circuit embedded on each NiMH battery, which gives their level and stores the battery's parameters so that the charger can adapt its charging algorithm to batteries of different capacity or chemistry. Furthermore, this power management unfit takes advantage of the controller area network (CAN) and the PIC18F brain to act as a monitoring, fully configurable, remotely controllable and autonomous node.",

It employs a new MR-compatible optical micrometry based on differential measure of light intensity. This technology enables highly accurate and sensitive two degrees-of-freedom displacement sensing by using optoelectronic devices and pair of fiber optics. In order to realize three-axis force sensitivity, two micrometers are aligned in orthogonal directions. The accuracy of this force sensor is better than 3.0% and the maximum displacement of the detector is about 40 /spl mu/m under the applied force ranging from 0 to 15 N in vertical, and -8 to 8 N in horizontal directions. The loss of homogeneity of the magnetic field and signal-to-noise ratio of the MR image caused by this sensor are observed to be 0.49 ppm and 0.49 to 7.30% that show the sufficient MR compatibility of this sensor.",

Joint are passively compliant, consisting of a mechanical leaf spring and rotary damper giving the manipulator high passivity. Cylindrical or spherical surfaces of the body including the elbow and wrist are overlaid with distributed tactile sensors acquiring accurate contact information.

Next, the similarity evaluation and dynamic stability based on ZMP (zero moment point) of the humanoid motion are discussed, and the method to derive humanoid motion with a high similarity, and satisfying kinematic constraints and dynamic stability, is presented. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by simulations and experiments with the \"sword\" motion - a complicated and dynamic Chinese kungfu movement - using our developed humanoid robot with 32 degree of freedom.",

        "abstract": "In the age of PR (personal robot), the demand for various and complicated exterior designs has become greater. This paper focuses on improving the designability of the exterior of robots. A main cause of discouraging the designability is that the exterior and mechanism designs are not independent. We try to lower the mutuality between them by proposing a fabricating method of humanoid covers with insert molding. This method prevents weight excess and shrinkage of the movable ranges caused by attaching the cover and allows complicated shape of the cover, but has three major problems to be solved. Firstly, the restoring joint torque caused by the deformation of the cover should be estimated. Secondly, the cables should be arranged inside the cover so as not to be tensioned too much. Thirdly, an appropriate way of heat radiation is needed. In this paper, design methods of a humanoid with insert-molded cover such as the equations to estimate the restoring torque, the cable arrangement and the way of heat radiation are described. Finally, the prototype now being designed is mentioned.",

        "abstract": "Design process of a robust flow-path network for automated guided vehicle (AGV) systems is proposed in this paper. An effectiveness of a system with a robust flow-path network does not sink against any task. However, for this robust flow-path, the number of possible tasks is very large in AGV systems, therefore it is impossible to test the promising flow-path network against all of possible tasks. The problem is solved by the method of difficult task design with genetic algorithm (GA). The effective flow-path network is designed with GA simultaneously, because the difficult tasks depend on the flow-path networks. Competitive co-evolution is applied to the simultaneous design. Results of the designing are shown through simulations and the designed flow-path network makes it possible to complete 10000 tasks that are generated randomly.",

In order to meet the requirement on quadruped walking, a hand with multiple fingers that can also be used as the front foot is designed. A method of generating steady dynamic biped walking patterns based on variable ZMP is proposed. The motion simulation on the biped walking and quadruped walking of the robot by shifting the robot hands as feet is finished by means of a software for dynamics analysis, so that the basic walking ability of the robot can be ensured.

The ability to track human in the home environment is one of fundamental functions of home robots. In this paper, we introduce a prototype of Samsung home robot (SHR) developed by Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT) and present a scheme of tracking user movement utilizing a structured light range sensor. The structured light range sensor is considered to be cost-effective and robust for a wide range of environment; however, its low resolution of range data tends to extract wrong features for the human tracking, such as table legs, trash cans, door-edges, etc. To compromise this weakness, we have developed an algorithm that excludes those features that do not come from human legs. Efficacy and robustness of this proposed system were examined through experiments in the real home environment.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with the problem of determining independent grasps regions on the object boundary such that a four frictionless grasp with a contact point in each region assures a form-closure grasp independently of the exact position of the contact point. These regions are useful to provide some robustness to the grasp in front of finger positioning errors as well as in the design of fixtures. Given a discrete description of a 2D object, the methodology takes into account the uncertainty in the object description and it determines the independent regions without using hard iterative search procedures. The procedure has been implemented and an example of the proposed methodology is included in the paper.",

The great amount of hand injuries is not only a problem for the affected people but economic consequences follow because rehabilitation takes a long time. Physical therapy after an operation is associated with high personnel expenses. To improve therapy results and reduce cost of rehabilitation a hand exoskeleton was developed. The hand exoskeleton was specifically designed to accomplish requirements of medical applications. For research on control algorithms and rehabilitation programs a prototype supporting all four degrees of freedom of one finger was build. The device can be easily attached and also be adjusted to deformed and scarred hands. In view of the fact that a lot of hand injuries affect only one finger, this prototype could already be functional in physical therapy. This paper presents the construction and the control system of the hand exoskeleton and possible applications in therapy of hand injuries. For the position control a PID controller was implemented and evaluated. The resulting control system allows following of recorded trajectories with sufficient accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Several robotic surgical systems have been developed for minimally-invasive surgery including commercialized products such as da Vinci and ZEUS. We have developed a minimally-invasive surgical system, which had performed remote surgery experiments for four times until now (performed on pigs over 150 km in Japan). In this paper, two approaches that extend the system from the perspective of extensions of surgeon's dexterity are described. The first approach is a development of complex robotic forceps, which have multiple d.o.f. on their tip. A complex rigid link mechanism has been applied to the robotic forceps to realize 3 d.o.f. motions in a patient's abdominal cavity. With the rigid link mechanism, surgeons have no longer need to be concerned a cable cutting problem, which often can be happened on conventional cable driven systems. The second approach is a force feedback capability. The developed rigid link mechanism is preferable for an implementation of a force feedback capability. The force feedback capability is important not only for extending surgeon's dexterity but also for preventing unexpected damage on internal organs. An evaluation experiment of the force feedback capability on a simulated surgical procedure was conducted. An augmented force presentation method was developed that displays contact information between forceps and soft tissues. In an evaluation experiment, the load applied to soft organ tissues was reduced by approximately 30% compared with a conventional force feedback method.",

Although all motion for the upper limb by the armor-type muscle suit with the mechanical joints and hard frame is realized, shoulder joints has difficulty in smooth motion because of DOF limitation. To overcome the limitation, new link mechanism is proposed and smooth motion for shoulder is achieved.",

We propose a new compensation method to improve position accuracy of leg mechanisms of walking robots. With this method, compliance data that is measured manually in advance is used. At present, TITAN XI - a practical quadruped robot for use in construction - is under development, and this compensation method is being applied to its control system. In this paper, the measurement of the compliance of the leg system using a hydraulic cylinder, the bending of the legs in walking motion, and the walking motion with compensation are shown.",

The vocal cords are made from the thermoplastic rubber \"Septon\", available from Kuraray Co. Ltd, which has a similar elasticity to human tissue. The vocal cord model was constructed with a similar structure to the biological structure of the human vocal cords. The vocal cords vibrated like those of a human. The new lips were able to attain a large deformation in a similar manner to human lips, without the leakage of air. This allowed clear pronunciation of vowels. With these new mechanisms, the robot could reproduce human speech in a more biological manner and could produce voices closer to those of a human.",

The embedded Linux based wearable medical computer connects various sensors which can detect the patients' vital signs, such as electrocardiogram (ECG), body temperature, and body humidity. In order to get more reliable and accurate information, the multi-sensor fusion algorithm is employed to integrate the sensor information. The filter banks based QRS complex and heart beat detection algorithm, and fuzzy fusion algorithms are implemented to construct the diagnosis system of this wearable biomedical computer. Furthermore, the personal nursing agent (PNA) and multi-agent based infrastructure for modern patient information and management system are developed. The experimental results show that this system is helpful and useful for managing and monitoring patients. Accordingly, the wearable biomedical health-care system is regarded as a highly efficient biomedical system and inherits both features of multi-agent architecture and wearable computing, i.e., decentralized, reliable, autonomous, unrestrictive, and cooperative features.",

It is difficult for a biped robot with rigid and flat soles to maintain four-point contact on uneven terrain. It means that the biped robot can lose its balance. To solve this kind of problem, we should study not only stability control methods but also foot mechanisms. In this paper, a new foot system, WS-1 (Waseda shoes $no.1), is proposed to maintain four-point contact. This foot system consists of cam-type locking mechanism. WS-1 is attached to the feet of WL-16 (Waseda leg - no.16) that is the world's first biped-walking robot capable of carrying a human. Through hardware experiments, the effectiveness of the foot system is confirmed.",

In addition, the high compliance which is a positive feature of the McKibben actuator is still conserved. This paper consists of four main parts. First of all, different types of soft displacement sensors made out of rubber were composed, and tested for their functional characteristics. Secondly, the intelligent McKibben actuator was developed with the soft displacement sensor incorporated within. Then, experiments of the position servo control with a single intelligent McKibben actuator were carried out. At last a robot arm mechanism was designed with two intelligent McKibben actuators, and those experimental results showed a great potential for its future applications.",

In order to detect incipient slip, a PVDF strip is arranged along the direction normal to the surface of the finger of the robot hand. Also, a thin flexible sensor to sense the static force as well as the contact location, is fabricated into an arrayed type using pressure variable resistor ink. In addition, a tactile sensing system is developed with miniaturized electronic hardware such as charge amplifier, signal processing unit etc., and it feasibility is validated experimentally.",

To assist the physician during endoscopic surgery, we have developed an ultrasonically activated bending scalpel constructed of super elasticity alloy (SEA in short). We analyzed the vibration characteristics of the probe in the bending state by the finite element method. And the proposed active bending mechanism is prototyped. Moreover the vibration characteristics were measured to examine its effectiveness. Also, a cutting experiment was conducted. We demonstrate that ultrasonic vibration of the proposed scalpel is possible using a conventional vibration controller, since the change of the natural frequency due to the bend is negligible. In the prototyping, we realized the bending mechanism by using a linkage. The range of the bending angles varies from 0/spl deg/ to 60/spl deg/.",

In the model, the constrained forces are expressed as an algebraic function of the state and input generalized forces by using the equation of constraints. Using this result, a new sensorless force control law is proposed by taking the advantage of the redundancy of input generalized forces to the constrained forces. A controller for a grinding robot is then constructed according to this control law and without involving any force sensors. Grinding experiments have been done for evaluating the feasibility of the controller by taking an articulated planar two-link manipulator as an example. Results show that the constrained force is explicitly controlled by proposed control law. The effectiveness of the controller for real grinding task has been verified.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, a new gait is presented for a quadruped walking robot with waist-joint. Although various types of walking robot have already been developed, their structure and gaits are still quite distinct from the natural walking motion of an animal, and the key point is that animals have waist-joint and use their waist-joint to walk, but, on the other hand a conventional 4-legged walking robot even has single rigid body which has no waist joint. Especially in turning, most animals bend oneself on one side, which makes turn faster and more stable. Spinning gait is very important as same as straight forward/backward gait. All animals need a spinning gait to avoid obstacle or to change walking direction. Therefore, this paper proposes a discontinuous gait for a quadruped walking robot with waist-joint which divides body into the front and rear parts of the body. Firstly, we describe a kinematic relation of waist-joint, the hip, and the centre of gravity of body, and then find the optimal values of parameters to spin most stable with simulation. We implemented a waist-jointed walking robot and showed that proposed spinning gait using waist-joint is more stable than that of a conventional walking robot.",

The modification not only allowed the collective to achieve a steady state of 100% performance in most cases but also reduced both the influence of target-to-robot ratios and the size of the work radius as well as the performance variance. Communication solved an interference effect, rather than create one. The results are discussed from a perspective that focuses on messages that move the collective as a whole from an initial state to a solution state. Such messages provide information about the current task state, rather than information about the state of individual members or the location of attractors.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a distributed reasoning system, called ASyMTRe-D, which enables a team of robots to form coalitions to accomplish a multi-robot task through tightly-coupled sensor sharing. The theoretical foundation of the negotiation protocol is ASyMTRe, an approach we developed previously to synthesize task solutions according to the task requirements and the team composition. The goal of the ASyMTRe approach is to increase the task solution capabilities of heterogeneous multi-robot teams by changing the fundamental abstraction from the typical \"task\" abstraction to a \"schema\" abstraction and automatically reconfigure the schemas to address the task at hand. The decision-making in this prior work was fully centralized; the current paper presents a distributed version of this approach based on the contract net protocol, which can achieve higher levels of robustness than the centralized version. The purpose here is not to improve the original protocol, but to apply it to our problem so that the autonomous task solution capabilities of robots can be achieved in a distributed manner. Simulation results are provided to validate the protocol with performance analysis. Finally, we compare ASyMTRe-D with the centralized ASyMTRe. Our future objective is to enable the human designer to specify the desired balance between solution quality and robustness, enabling the reasoning approach to invoke the appropriate level of information-sharing among robots to reach the specified solution characteristics.",

        "abstract": "Visual control tasks demand very fast processing and transfer of huge amounts of data - live video images. Nowadays, computers and communication systems have become powerful enough to allow more flexible implementations of visual control tasks, enlarging the field of application to embrace networked systems, e.g. cooperative robots or mobile manipulators. In such setups, video grabbing, vision processing, and control might be located in different platforms across the network. This paper presents a cross-platform, networked implementation of visual control tasks based on software agents and video streaming technologies. This implementation consists of free, off-the-shelf, software components, resulting in a transparent system whose configuration can be adapted to existing hardware in very different ways, without any modification in the source code. We present several configurations which span onboard and offboard camera setups, and we experimentally determine the control loop delay of a real system, to test the feasibility of the proposed approach.",

Paths can be corridors, footpaths, catwalks, roads, etc. In fact roads can be considered as well-structured paths. Traditional approaches to path following has been extensions of road following systems. We present a vision-based path following method different to that of the traditional model fitting approach of road following. The method focuses on tracking the direction in which parallel lines in the environment are aligned. It is similar in principle to methods that extract vanishing points but with better robustness achieved with appropriate simplifying assumptions. Some preliminary results of successful path following experiments are also presented.",

Firstly, the system states are divided into several different subsystems. For each of these subsystems, a first-layer sliding plane is constructed. From these first-layer sliding planes, then we further construct a second-layer sliding plane. By analyzing the features of the mathematical model of the underactuated mechanical systems, we derive the sliding-mode control law and indicate the ranges of the controller parameters. Using Lyapunov law, the paper proves the stability of all the sliding planes theoretically. The simulation results show the validity of this method for this class of underactuated mechanical systems.",

The proposed system performs both lane detection and vehicle recognition. In lane detection, three features including lane markers, brightness, slenderness and proximity are applied to detect the positions of lane markers in the image. On the other hand, vehicle recognition is achieved by using an evident feature which is extracted through three four steps: taillight standing-out process, adaptive thresholding, centroid detection, and taillight pairing algorithm. Besides, an automatic method is also provided to calculate the tilt and the pan of the camera by using the position of vanishing point which is detected in the image by applying Canny edge detection, Hough transform, major straight line extraction and vanishing point estimation. Experimental results for thousands of images are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in the nighttime. The lane detection rate is nearly 99%, and the vehicle recognition rate is about 91%. Furthermore, our system can process the image in almost real time.",

By introducing a simplifying hypothesis, the inverse dynamic modeling is performed based upon the principle of virtual work.

        "abstract": "Active vision is widely used in robotics. However, it should be calibrated carefully before a vision task. In this paper, we propose a closed-form solution for dynamic calibration and 3D reconstruction using structured light system. In this system, we assume that the light planes cast from the DLP projector are calibrated and kept constant while the principal point of the camera is known. When the camera undergoes a planar motion, its effective focal lengths (measured in width and height of the pixels respectively) and motion parameters can be calibrated dynamically. Then the 3D reconstruction can be effectively carried out with only a single image of the concerned scene. This feature is significant for many dynamic environments. In some practical applications, such as robot navigation along ground plane, planar motion is sufficient and our method provides an effective solution.",

        "abstract": "In this paper the problem of interference avoidance for robots subject to dynamic constraints is investigated. First computed-torque method is used to obtain a linearized closed-loop system. For this linearized system the desired state that the robot is going to take at the next sampling period is checked by phase plane analysis to ensure the robot can be stopped without interferences, dynamic constraints are taken into account by calculating the bounds of the drive torques with interval evaluation. When the desired next state is not valid for interference avoidance, a new state is scheduled by optimizing the next velocity, interval analysis is used again which allows to partition the complex constrained optimization problem into a simple two-stage problem. The resulting optimal state not only secures the robot against interference but also leads the robot to trace the desired path closely. Simulation results of a 2-DOF robot arm show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "So far, in-situ PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) films bonded to the surface of flexible cantilever structure act as the micro-force sensors, they are mostly modelled using quasi-static relationships. However, such sensors are usually a significantly compliant and easily deformable structure in order to reach highly sensitive performance in micromanipulation. As a result, this may be reasonable to consider bandwidth measurement and high frequency response for achievement of high accuracy, and thus a dynamic analysis of such sensors become essentially necessary. In this paper, a cantilever beam based micro-force sensor was designed based on the infinite dimensional system model (distributed parameter model) using the Bernouli-Euler formulation. Furthermore, in order to enable an engineering implementation, we used a zero frequency term to effectively replace the high order modes of the dynamic sensing model in the prescribed frequency range. The corrected model can efficiently minimize the effect of removed higher order modes, and then the micro-force measurement can be obtained accurately with this corrected in-bandwidth dynamic model. Preliminary simulation and experimental results both verified the performance of the developed dynamic micro-force sensor and the effectiveness of the corrected model.",

A new robust adaptive controller is proposed with the aid of adaptive backstepping and robust control techniques. The proposed controller guarantees that the tracking error converges to a small ball containing the origin. The ball's radius can be adjusted by control parameters. Uncertainties in both of kinematics and dynamics of mobile robots are considered of the first time in the frame of robust and adaptive control in this paper. Simulation results show effectiveness of the proposed controller.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new adaptive controller for dynamic image-based visual servoing of a robot manipulator when the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera are not calibrated. To cope with nonlinear dependence of the image Jacobian on the unknown parameters, this controller employs a matrix called nonscaled image Jacobian which does not depend on the scale factors determined by the depths of feature points. By removing the scale factors, the camera parameters appear linearly in the close-loop dynamics so that a new algorithm, different from Slotine and Li's, is developed to estimate their values on-line. In the parameter adaptation, in addition to the regressor term, our algorithm also uses the errors between the real and estimated projections of the feature points on the image plane so as to guarantee the convergence of the estimated parameters to the real values up to a scale. A new Lyapunov function is introduced to prove asymptotic convergence of the image errors based on the robot dynamics. Experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller.",

It uses planar features extracted probabilistically from dense three-dimensional point clouds generated by a rotating 2D laser scanner. These features are represented in compliance with the symmetries and perturbation model (SPmodel) in a stochastic map. As the robot moves, this map is updated incrementally while its pose is tracked by using an extended Kalman filter. After showing how three-dimensional data can be generated, the probabilistic feature extraction method is described, capable of robustly extracting (infinite) planes from structured environments. The SLAM algorithm is then used to track a robot moving through an indoor environment and its capabilities in terms of 3D reconstruction are analyzed.",

An appropriate sensing approach is to enclose a small permanent magnet in the capsule. The magnet establishes a magnetic field around the patient's body. With the sensing data of magnetic sensor array outside the patient's body, the 3D location and 2D orientation of the capsule can be calculated. Higher localization and orientation accuracy can be obtained if more sensors and proper optimization algorithm are applied. In this paper, different nonlinear optimization algorithms are evaluated, and we have found that Levenberg-Marquardt method provides higher accuracy and faster speed. Simulations were done for investigating the de-noise ability of this algorithm based on different sensor arrays. Furthermore, the real experiment shows that the results are satisfactory with high accuracy.",

However, unnecessary large volumes of communication data usually lead to time delay and energy waste. This paper addresses the problem of how to efficiently synchronize the map (or explored area) among multiple robots when they carry out cooperative area exploration or coverage. In this application, multiple robots need exchange map information in order to minimize the repeated exploration or coverage. When a connected ad hoc network can not be maintained, the map synchronization problem becomes more challenging. In this paper, a sequence number based map representation scheme and an effective map update tracking scheme are proposed. Based on them, an algorithm is developed to reduce the volumes of map exchange when robot subnetworks merge. Simulation results validate this algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Occupancy grid mapping algorithms assume that grid block values are independently distributed. However, most environments of interest contain spatial patterns that are better characterized by models that capture dependencies among grid blocks. To account for such dependencies, we model the environment as a pairwise Markov random field. We specify a belief propagation-based mapping algorithm that takes these dependencies into account when estimating a map. To demonstrate the potential benefits of this approach, we simulate a simple multi-robot minefield mapping scenario. Minefields contain spatial dependencies since some landmine configurations are more likely than others, and since clutter, which causes false alarms, can be concentrated in certain regions and completely absent in others. Our belief propagation-based approach outperforms conventional occupancy grid mapping algorithms in the sense that better maps can be obtained with significantly fewer robot measurements. The belief propagation algorithm requires a modest amount of increased computation, but we contend that in applications where significant energy and time expenditure is associated with robot movement and active sensing, the reduction in the required number of samples justified the increased computation.",

        "abstract": "Several robotic and computer vision applications depend upon the efficient determination of polygonal self- and mutual-intersection checking. The commonly used algorithms for intersection checking rely upon static geometric primitives, such as lines and vertices. When these geometric primitives are dynamic, that is moving or changing shape, these algorithms become inefficient due to repeated actions that do not utilize topological features of the primitives. In this paper we present a novel algorithm for line segment intersection checking that builds a query structure and then updates the structure using previously computed topological data. We exploit the fact that the amount of model deformation is limited during any single iteration, yielding a relatively small bookkeeping cost to maintain the query structure. The result is an algorithm whose asymptotic runtime complexity in the expected case is better than competing methods. We then suggest an extension of this work into higher dimensions (polytope intersection for 3D and higher).",

Such a system is useful for performing reaching and manipulation tasks, online force control, and quickly computing goal configurations for path planning algorithms. We have implemented a prototype system on the digital human version humanoid robot platform 2 (DH-HRP2) which we use to efficiently compute arm inverse kinematic solutions. We demonstrate the benefits of such a system applied to converting workspace trajectories to configuration space trajectories. Although we have applied the technique to finding joint configurations with high manipulability, our approach can be generalized to a variety of different priority measures that may be used for evaluating inverse kinematic solutions for redundant manipulators.",

Instead of previous Haar-like rectangle features, we choose rectangle features for facial expression recognition among all possible rectangle types in a 3/spl times/3 matrix form using the AdaBoost algorithm. Also, the facial expression recognition system constituted with the proposed rectangle features is compared to that with previous rectangle features with regard to its capacity. The results show that the proposed approach has better performance in facial expression recognition in terms of simulation and experimental results.",

By combining these innovations, we have created a truly wearable network that allows full generality of sensor location, spatial distribution of the medium to reduce overall bulk, and maintains sufficiently low line impedance for simultaneous power and data delivery over a single conductor. We have created a method for analysis of the transmission properties of conductive fabric garments. In addition, we evaluate the basic transmission line characteristics of the garment.

        "abstract": "When building autonomous robotic agents, designers almost always make assumptions about how the control system relates sensory information to motor actions, in order to provide the agent with a set of basic behaviors. This raises the question of how arbitrary these assumptions are, and to what extent the introduced biases reduce the potential for the generation of new behaviors arising from interaction with the environment. In this paper, we propose a new model of robot control architecture, consisting merely of homogeneous, non-hierarchical sensorimotor coupling. We show that a robot using this model can display coherent complex behaviors which emerge from the agent-environment interaction, such as tracking an object, or solving a task based on the temporal relationship between an early clue and a delayed reward.",

Since an emergency occurs at unpredictable timing and at any state of robot, the stopping motion must be generated in real-time. To overcome these problems, our emergency stop motion is divided into four phases according to the role of the zero-moment point (ZMP). In each phase, approximate analytical solutions of the center of gravity (COG) dynamics is used to generate the motion. During the single support phase, a landing time and position are determined by evaluating the average velocity of the swing leg and the horizontal position of the COG. During the double support phase, the travel distance of the COG and the ZMP are evaluated. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed by simulation and experiment using a humanoid robot HRP-2.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an enhanced learning classifier system used to evolve obstacle-avoidance rules used in mobile robot navigation. The robot learns these rules via feedback from the environment, available as sonar readings. Conventional classifiers, when used in this application, show evidence of shortcomings: becoming trapped in local minima, loss of (desirable) rules, and favouring of generalized rules. Enhancements to the classification system are described and tested using a simulated robot and environment. The enhancements prove to be worthwhile in that they overcome the limitations, and can generally handle more complex situations.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel entropy-based method for feature selection in order to reduce the computational burden for real time simultaneous localization and map building (SLAM) for mobile robot navigation. Our approach is based on information (entropy) theory together with a data association method to initialize new features into the map, match measurements to the map features, and remove out-of-date features. The selected features are optimum in the sense that fusion of measurements from those features with existing information would yield the most entropy reduction in estimating the robot location and the map features' locations. Our method has the advantage of selecting a suitable number of features by considering the computational constraint in real time implementations. Simulation results show that the proposed entropy based feature selection strategy is effective in dealing with the map scaling problem in SLAM.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an architecture for estimating environmental odor maps and presents experimental results obtained using that architecture with five mobile robots inside a large laboratory with two odor sources and forced ventilation. The mobile sensing agents employed in the experiments have self localization capabilities and carry an electronic nose and a thermal anemometer. The proposed architecture allows integrating sparse olfaction data gathered by the mobile agents along their trajectories and dynamically estimate the spatial concentration of different odor fields. The data assimilation process is made centrally by a PC that polls periodically each robot through a RF network in order to get the data gathered during the previous acquisition period. The estimation of odor fields is made in two steps: first each agent estimates the odor mixture and concentration by means of a neural network-based regression algorithm that converts values from gas sensor space to the corresponding odor space. Then the sensed data is assimilated into an advection-diffusion model by means of a reduced order Kalman filter. In the current implementation the central controller, responsible for the maps estimation, specifies to each agent their target area to explore. The proposed architecture was validated with a set of experiments that demonstrated its ability to estimate and capture the dynamics of overlapping odor fields. This work can easily be adapted to city buses or other local transportation systems in order to monitor the pollution or quickly detect hazardous chemicals inside cities.",

        "abstract": "The sense of balance is the basic skill of biological system. It is combined and unified with other motion skills of animals. By sensing the direction of the gravity from accelerometers, we can acquire a universal vertical reference which makes it much easier to estimation head orientation from visual sensors. This paper proposes a new method of estimating head orientation of a humanoid-like mobile robot by mounting a fisheye camera on its head. The camera rotation is estimated based upon a sky-ground representation, which is a spherical image combined with a vertical reference determined by sensing the direction of gravity. The spherical image can then be divided into two parts, sky part and ground part, along the horizon. Since the direction of the gravity is acquired from accelerometers, what we require to estimate about camera rotation is only the yaw component. Since the yaw rotation does not give rise to any content change for the sky part (the upper part of a spherical image), but a shift along the azimuth angle in a polar spherical coordinate system, the yaw component can be estimated by a phase correlation method which is referred to as the Fourier shift property. By combining the gravity with visual cues, we can estimate camera rotation without accumulated errors for a local scene. In our method no complicated computation is required and robust results are acquired for a dynamic and cluttered outdoor environment even if there is some illumination change.",

This paper describes a technique that can estimate the contact geometric and position information between a quadric object and a quadric environment from a number of positions and orientations of a moving object, which are measured while the object is dexterously slid and rotated on the environment around the contact position. There are six kinds of basic contact forms when the two quadric bodies are in contact with each other. Corresponding to four of these basic contact forms, four kinds of estimation approaches are proposed. By these estimation approaches, the environment geometric and position information on contacting parts can be estimated successfully. Experimental verification on the proposed approaches is performed and its results are outlined.",

The contribution of this paper is in the proposal of a hybrid technique to mitigate sample impoverishment such that the number of particles required and hence the computation complexities are reduced. Studies are conducted through the use of Chebyshev inequality for the number of particles required. The relationship between the number of particles and the time for impoverishment is examined by considering the takeover phenomena as found in genetic algorithms. It is revealed that the sample impoverishment problem is caused by the resampling scheme in implementing the particle filter with a finite number of particles. The use of uniform or roulette-wheel sampling also contributes to the problem. Crossover operators from genetic algorithms are adopted to tackle the finite particle problem by re-defining or re-supplying impoverished particles during filter iterations. Effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by simulations for a monobot simultaneous localization and mapping application.",

Predicting locomotion performance depends on the ability to accurately characterize the wheel-soil interactions. In this research, wheel-soil interaction experiments were carried out on a single-wheel testbed and the results were compared with a single-wheel dynamic computer simulator which was developed in Matlab and Simulink's SimMechanics toolbox using a commercially-available wheel-soil interaction computer model called AESCO Soft Soil Tire Model (AS/sup 2/TM). Two different tire treads were used and compared in this study. There is good agreement between experimental and simulation results for wheel sinkage as a function of slip ratio; however, more investigation is needed to understand the differences observed for the drawbar pull and motor torque results.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a formal selection framework of multiple navigation behaviors for a service robot. In our approach, modeling, analysis, and performance evaluation are carried out based on the generalized stochastic Petri nets (GSPN). By adopting probabilistic approach, our framework helps the robot to select the most desirable navigation behavior in run time according to environmental conditions. Moreover, after a mission, the robot evaluates prior navigation performance from accumulated data, and uses the results for the improvement of future operations. Also, GSPN has several advantages over classic automata or direct use of Markov process. The basic ideas of the framework were introduced in our previous work (Gunhee Kim et al., 2005). Thus, this paper focuses on experimental verification by implementing the framework into the guide robot Jinny. We conduct the experiments about real guidance tasks with visitors in the National Science Museum of Korea. The results show that the proposed strategy is useful to select an appropriate navigation behavior in a dynamic space.",

Contrary to classical extended Kalman filtering, this approach allows global localization, and contrary to Bayesian localization it provides guaranteed results in the sense that a set is computed that contains all of the configurations that are consistent with the data and hypotheses. The approach is particularly robust to outliers.",

Considering slip condition of wheels, the front wheel steered bicycle model of the mobile robot is derived. The explicit force control algorithm is applied to regulate contact force generated from the object which minimizes a force error between a desired force and an actual force. Performances of force tracking control for different stiffness of environment have been tested. Simulation results show that the proposed control algorithm works quite well to maintain desired contact force on the environment.",

        "abstract": "Reactive mobile robot navigation based on potential field methods has shown to be a good solution for dealing with unknown and dynamic environments, where timely responses are required. Unfortunately, the complexity of the tasks which can successfully be carried out is restricted by the inherent shortcomings of the approach such as trapping situations due to local minima, difficulties passing among closely spaced obstacles, oscillations in narrow corridors, etc... This paper proposes a novel strategy which overcomes totally the first limitation and partially the others by computing an adaptive navigation function on the basis of such artificial potential fields. As a result, navigation is achieved in very difficult scenarios such as maze-like environments. A comparative study on the path length performance of our proposal with regard to other algorithms from the related literature is also presented. Both simulation and real tests are performed.",

Its issue is how to extract symbols from various kinds of temporal states of the object. We use the recurrent neural network with parametric bias (RNNPB) that generates self-organized nodes in the parametric bias space. The RNNPB with 42 neurons was trained with the data of sounds, trajectories, and tactile sensors generated while the robot was moving/hitting an object with its own arm. The clusters of 20 kinds of objects were successfully self-organized. The experiments with unknown (not trained) objects demonstrated that our method configured them in the PB space appropriately, which proves its generalization capability.",

The first stage gives an approximate pupil location while the second stage refines the result of the first stage. This two stage approach allows graceful degradation - an approximate 1/sup st/ stage result can be used should 2/sup nd/ stage processing fail. Results from a software based implementation of this algorithm show that our integer based method has similar localization accuracy to floating point ellipse fitting techniques.",

With the FPGAs for lower level control and DSP (digital signal processor) for higher level control, the whole hardware is very intelligent. By using the high capacity of FPGAs, the additional hardware such as communication controller and PWM generators, can be implemented in a single chip and the hardware system is more flexible and compact. In each finger there is an FPGA for data collection, brushless DC motors control and communication with palm's FPGA by point-to-point serial communication (PPSeCo). The kernel of the hardware system is a PCI-based high speed floating-point DSP for data processing, and FPGA for high-speed (up to 25Mbps) real-time serial communication with the palm's FPGA. There needs only 4 cables for the data transmission and the sampling cycle for each sensor is only 200 /spl mu/s.

In Bayesian discriminating feature method, face and nonface probability can be calculated with probabilistic models of the face and nonface feature vectors which consists of horizontal, vertical histograms, and 1D wavelets of the image inside the candidate window. These probabilities are modeled as Gaussian distribution and can be used to distinguish face regions from nonface regions. To search proper face candidate regions, we propose the particle attractive genetic algorithm which can fast converge on the exact face region. The proposed method demonstrates fast and precise detection results with the images obtained from offices or outdoor environments.",

By using this method we can make a facial expression easily compared with other methods of mechanical facial expression. Also there is a three-dimensional effect caused by the curved surface, which is not in a plane image. We develop a face robot with a curved surface display, which is composed of a dome screen, a fish-eye lens and a projector. Also the face robot has a neck mechanism to move the head. This paper describes a composition of a dome display, a compensation of distorted image, a drawing method of shadow images with detecting a direction of a light source. The animation of facial expression and the motion using the neck mechanism are performed, and the effectiveness of the system is examined.",

An arc feature association model was developed, which associates two sonar footprints into an arc feature. The association model provides information on the regions of center points of the arc feature. The information makes it possible to decide weather the two sonar footprints are associated with a line, point or arc. Lines, points, or arc features are extracted from more than two independent sonar footprints using the arc feature association model. We also propose a method that estimates the position uncertainties of the extracted features by considering both the pose uncertainty of the robot and the measurement uncertainty of the sonar sensor. This pose uncertainty is also used in the arc feature association process of the sonar footprints. The proposed method has been tested in a real home environment with a mobile robot.",

The main challenge in using images for mobile robots is managing this wealth of information. A relatively recent approach is the use of fast wide baseline local features, which we developed and used in the novel approach to sparse visual path following described in this paper. These local features have the great advantage that they can be recognized even if the viewpoint differs significantly. This opens the door to a memory efficient description of a path by descriptors of sparse images. We propose a method for re-execution of these paths by a series of visual homing operations which yield a navigation method with unique properties: it is accurate, robust, fast, and without odometry error build-up.",

        "abstract": "The efficiency of probabilistic roadmap (PRM) planners drops dramatically in spaces with narrow passages. This paper presents a new method - small-step retraction - that helps PRM planners find paths through such passages. The method consists of slightly fattening the robot's free space, constructing a roadmap in the fattened free space, and repairing colliding portions of this roadmap by retracting them out of collision. The fattened free space is not explicitly computed. Instead, the robot links and/or obstacles are thinned around their medial axis. A robot configuration lies in fattened free space if the thinned objects do not collide at this configuration. Two repair strategies are used. The \"optimist\" strategy waits until a complete path has been found in fattened free space before repairing it. The \"pessimist\" strategy repairs the roadmap as it is being built. The former is faster, but the latter is more reliable. A simple combination yields an integrated planner that is both fast and reliable.",

This paper presents a technique to investigate in-vivo finger joint kinematics using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Bone surface models were extracted from MR images of the right hand of ten healthy subjects in four different postures. The relative motion of adjacent bones for all subjects was calculated and expressed as the helical axis and the angles around the axes of local bone coordinate system. The motion data indicated the change of axis orientation with flexion. After carefully selecting the subject and a pose with an appropriate flexional angle, studies determined that the mean inclination between the axes of the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints was approximately 14 [deg].",

Fixed-step simulation techniques are especially desirable for control purposes, such as haptic friction rendering and friction compensation. Previous techniques have difficulties especially in numerical robustness and extensibility to multidimensional cases. This paper proposes two discrete-time friction models that can be used in fixed-step simulations. They can be used in multidimensional space, and can capture arbitrary velocity-dependent friction phenomena. The first one is a discrete-time discontinuous model. This model determines the friction force so that the velocity reaches zero in finite time by using the values of the mass and the timestep size. The second one is a discrete-time continuous model, which is a serial coupling of the discontinuous model and a linear viscoelastic element. This model is useful for haptic rendering because it is formulated as a velocity-input, force-output system. The second model can be extended into a more sophisticated friction model, which exhibits a hysteresis behavior in the presliding regime. Results of numerical simulations and an experiment are presented.",

        "abstract": "We developed a very small and light butterfly-type ornithopter (BTO) to investigate butterfly flight. Its weight is 0.4 g, wing span is 140 mm and flapping frequency is 10 Hz. It flies forward passively. The flights were recorded with a highspeed video camera and the longitudinal motion of the BTO was analyzed. When the center of gravity was appropriate, the angle of attack of the body varied cyclically. We found that the cyclical change of the angle of attack produced total upward aerodynamic force. Then we visualized air flow around the BTO both in tethered flight and in free flight. We revealed that free body motion caused a stable attachment of leading edge vortex. We also found that the free body motion helped the wings' smooth upstroke, which was not found in tethered flight.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers a group of mobile autonomous agents moving in the space with point mass dynamics and with asymmetric coupling matrix. We investigate the dynamic properties of the group for the case that the topology of the neighboring relations between agents varies with time. Under the assumption that the neighboring graphs are always connected, we show that stable flocking motion can be achieved by using a set of switching control laws. The control laws are a combination of attractive/repulsive and alignment forces. By using the control laws, all agent velocities become asymptotically the same, collisions can be avoided between the agents, and the final tight formation minimizes all agent potentials. Moreover, we show that the velocity of the center of mass is invariant and is equal to the final common velocity. Finally, we study the motion of the group when the velocity damping is taken into account. We prove that the common velocity asymptotically approaches zero. In this case, we can properly modify the control laws to generate the same stable flocking motion.",

This kind of control scheme is not portable and instability is an often occurring problem. The coupling scheme proposed in this paper is based on the passivity considerations on the teleoperated systems. It is independent of the used haptic interface and the manipulator and unconditionally stable regarding scaling ratios. It is experimented using the LRP's (Laboratoire de Robotique de Paris) micromanipulator, which is based on AFM architecture and uses the adhesion forces for pickup and release tasks. A comparison between the force position coupling and proposed coupling is presented. Experimental results show the good performances in terms of stability.",

        "abstract": "Active research into vehicle detection and tracking using a vision sensor are done for driver assistance systems (DAS) - collision warning and avoidance, vision enhancement, etc. The vehicle detection and tracking algorithm for DAS requires a robust feature extraction and tracking method regardless of the light and road conditions and an exact estimation of vehicle position and velocity regardless of the distance from the ego-vehicle. But most research was carried out in the day time with good lighting conditions and the little research done so far in the night time assumed no interference of headlights from other vehicles. This paper proposes a new robust vehicle detection and tracking method regardless of the light and road conditions at any distance using vision and sonar sensors. We use the sonar sensor for detection and distance estimation within 10 m and the image sensor over 10 m. First, this paper proposes a simple method that can determine the light condition by observing several images and this light condition is used by selecting one of several detection methods. The proposed vehicle detection method in the day time image can extract the shadow region represented by the boundary between a vehicle and the road and further verify using other vehicle features, such as symmetry rate, vertical edge, and lane information. The vehicle tracking method in the day time uses online template matching using the mean image created by several consecutive detection results. The vehicle detection method in the night time extracts bright regions caused by the headlights, taillights, brake lights, etc. and these candidates are verified by observing several consecutive frames.",

The mobile platform has two independent translations (T2) and two rotations (R2). A method is proposed for structural synthesis of fully-isotropic T2R2-type PMs based on the theory of linear transformations. A one-to-one correspondence exists between the actuated joint velocity space and the external velocity space of the moving platform. The Jacobian matrix mapping the two vector spaces of fully-isotropic T2R2-type PMs presented in this paper is the identity 4/spl times/4 matrix throughout the entire workspace. The condition number and the determinant of the Jacobian matrix being equal to one, the manipulator performs very well with regard to force and motion transmission capabilities. As far as we are aware, this paper presents for the first time in the literature solutions of singularity-free fully-isotropic PMs with four degrees of freedom T2R2-type.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel behavior modulation technique using fuzzy discrete event system (FDES) for mobile robots. The algorithm exploits the multi-valued feature of fuzzy logic (FL) and event-driven property of discrete event system (DES). Desirability (activity) of a behavior is expressed in terms of a fuzzy state vector. State-based prediction of the desirability is accomplished using fuzzy event matrices. A central arbiter employs priority based arbitration among the desirability state vectors and recommends new event matrices to modify the desirability states of the behaviors. The algorithm combines aspects of both command fusion and behavior arbitration. Furthermore, the proposed approach constitutes state-based observability and controllability to cope with the uncertainties of sensory data and dynamic environment. Simulation results of FDES-based mobile robot navigation are also presented to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "One of the main aims of humanoid robotics is to develop robots that are capable of interacting naturally with people. However, to understand the essence of human interaction, it is crucial to investigate the contribution of behavior and appearance. Our group's research explores these relationships by developing androids that closely resemble human beings in both aspects. If humanlike appearance causes us to evaluate an android's behavior from a human standard, we are more likely to be cognizant of deviations from human norms. Therefore, the android's motions must closely match human performance to avoid looking strange, including such autonomic responses as the shoulder movements involved in breathing. This paper proposes a method to implement motions that look human by mapping their three-dimensional appearance from a human performer to the android and then evaluating the verisimilitude of the visible motions using a motion capture system. This approach has several advantages over current research, which has focused on copying a person's moving joint angles to a robot: (1) in an android robot with many degrees of freedom and kinematics that differs from that of a human being, it is difficult to calculate which joint angles would make the robot's posture appear similar to the human performer; and (2) the motion that we perceive is at the robot's surface, not necessarily at its joints, which are often hidden from view.",

        "abstract": "The human thumb is a digit playing crucial roles among all digits used for object manipulation. The special feature of the thumb termed as pad-opposition with four other fingers makes human precision manipulation possible, and during four other fingers dexterously manipulate an object, the thumb functions as a role of stably supporting other's manipulating motions within the pad-opposition. In various characteristics of the thumb, this paper concentrates upon the large radius of pad curvature of the thumb compared with those of four other fingers. In order to show the influence of the large pad curvature, it is shown that reiterated fingering motions can be easily generated by a pair of robotic fingers with different pad curvatures by using a sensory-feedback. It is also shown from computer simulations and experiments that the pad curvature automatically distinguishes roles of the thumb and other fingers. It is finally claimed that the thumb plays a crucial role in enhancement of dexterity and stability in such an implicit manner that it helps the other opposite finger with less pad curvature to make a swift rolling movement that can sophisticatedly control movements of the object.",

        "abstract": "From recorded human motion, trajectory optimization of a humanoid robot with physical limits being the key constraint is presented. The optimization's objective function preserves the salient characteristics of the original motion, while constraints are used to transform the motion to the limit of the capabilities of the humanoid robot. It is shown that using constraints to limit generated trajectories to physically realizable motion ensures that limits are being met more precisely than by reducing them using a standard objective function. The use of wavelets vs. B-spline is compared, and it is shown that B-spline data representation has pronounced advantages. Furthermore, in regions of high-frequency motion not adequately modeled by an initial splining, B-spline is extensible into a hierarchy so that optimizations can be performed locally which still meet global criteria. It is shown how to use B-spline coefficients in angle-, velocity-, acceleration-, and dynamic force-constraints. To detect trajectory subsections with excessive error in need of control point adjustment and local re-optimization, not only is a traditional error detector used, but also a B-spline density detector is also presented. Generated motions were tested using our simulation program and the robot HRP-2.",

Many approaches use a specific tailor-made combination of algorithms that do not easily allow the inclusion of more, or other, types of algorithms. In this paper, we explore a variant of a generic algorithm for fusing visual cues to the task of object segmentation in a video stream. The fusion algorithm combines the output of several segmentation algorithms in a straight forward way by using a Bayesian approach and a particle filter to track several hypotheses. Segmentation algorithms can be added or removed without changing the over all structure of the system. It was of particular interest to investigate if the method was suitable when realistic real-world scenes with much noise was analysed. The system has been tested on image sequences taken from a moving vehicle where stationary and moving objects are successfully segmented from the background. In conclusion, the fusion algorithm explored is well suited to this problem domain and is easily adopted. The context of this work is on-line pedestrian detection to be deployed in cars.",

The algorithm proceeds in two stages. In order to account for an arbitrary robot footprint, the first stage takes the robot's orientation explicitly into account by constructing a navigation function in the (x, y, /spl theta/) configuration space. In a second stage, an admissible velocity is chosen from a window around the robot's current velocity, which contains all velocities that can be reached under the acceleration constraints. Fast computation over large areas is achieved by adopting multi-resolution (x, y) and (x, y, /spl theta/) planning. Several measures are taken to obtain safe and robust robot behaviour. Experimental results on our wheelchair test platform show the feasibility of the approach.",

We show that, using a grid sampling representation of the configuration space, it is possible to evaluate all vehicle location hypotheses in the environment (up to a certain resolution) with a computational cost that is bilinear: linear both in the number of map features and in the number of sensor measurements. We propose a pairing-driven algorithm that considers only individual measurement-feature pairings and thus, in contrast with current correspondence space algorithms, it avoids searching in the exponential correspondence space. It uses a voting strategy that accumulates evidence for each vehicle location hypothesis, assuring robustness to noise in the sensor measurements and environment models. The general nature of the proposed strategy allows the consideration of different types of features and sensor measurements. Using the popular Victoria Park dataset, we compare its performance with location-driven algorithms where the solution space is usually randomly sampled. We show that the proposed pairing-driven technique is computationally more efficient in proportion to the density of features in the environment.",

To this end, we propose one such strategy that optimizes global body parameters such as spin angular momentum and body principal angles, or the angles between the inertia tensor principal axes and the lab frame axes. This optimization strategy is easily combined with other optimization objectives (e.g. maximal efficiency) subject to physical constraints such as requiring that the ZMP operates within the support base. To deal with Bellman's \"curse of dimensionality\" we suggest, in parallel, two computational simplifications that may make the optimization problem tractable and easily implemented on today's humanoid robots. Finally, we address the problem of support base planning during ground and aerial locomotory phases. We propose novel online strategies for robust coordination of interacting limbs compatible with the proposed optimization strategy.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we combine a graphical approach for simultaneous localization and mapping, SLAM, with a feature representation that addresses symmetries and constraints in the feature coordinates, the measurement subspace, M-space. The graphical method has the advantages of delayed linearizations and soft commitment to feature measurement matching. It also allows large maps to be built up as a network of small local patches, star nodes. This local map net is then easier to work with. The formation of the star nodes is explicitly stable and invariant with all the symmetries of the original measurements. All linearization errors are kept small by using a local frame. The construction of this invariant star is made clearer by the M-space feature representation. The M-space allows the symmetries and constraints of the measurements to be explicitly represented. We present results using both vision and laser sensors.",

One benefit it has over traditional robot hands is the fact that our fingers conform to a grasped object's shape, giving rise to larger contact areas and the ability to apply larger frictional forces. In this paper, we demonstrate how we have extended our simulation and analysis system with finite element modeling to allow us to evaluate these complex contact types. We also propose a new contact model that better accounts for the deformations and show how grasp quality is affected. This work is part of a larger project to understand the benefits the human hand has in grasping.",

In order to manipulate micro-objects, it is inevitable to consider the scaling effect problem between worlds with different physical characteristics, with minimal loss of physical information and robustness against variation of scaling gains. Accordingly, the controllers are designed based on the framework H/sub /spl infin// loop shaping procedure approach. This approach allows a convenient means to trade-off the robustness for a pre-specified time-delay margin, variation of force scaling factors and uncertainties in master and slave modeling.

In this paper, especially, we improve an estimation system for dance steps, which estimates a next dance step intended by a human. For estimating the dance step, time series data of force/moment applied by a human to the robot are utilized. The time series data of force/moment measured during dancing by a human and the robot include the uncertainty such as time-lag and variations for each repeated trial, because a human can not always apply the same force/moment to the robot exactly. In order to treat the time series data including such uncertainty, hidden Markov models are utilized for designing the dance step estimation system. With the proposed system, the robot estimates a next dance step based on human intention successfully.",

The system consists of a hyper redundant haptic input device ViSHaRD10, a redundant 7DoF manipulator and a stereo vision system. The redundancy of the devices is exploited to assure large convex workspace and singularity-free operation. The anthropomorphic construction of the telemanipulator enables intuitive manipulation and increases the \"user-friendliness\" of the overall system. As a practical benchmark an assembly experiment in 6DoF for a case of a negligible time delay was successfully performed. Issues regarding inverse kinematics, spatial interaction control, transparency, and intuitiveness of teleoperation are discussed.",

Concepts for organizing reactive behavior in a hierarchical manner are rarely found in behavior-based approaches, and there is no widely accepted approach for creating such behavior hierarchies. Most applications of behavior-based concepts use only few behaviors and do not seem to scale well. Reuse of behaviors for different application scenarios or even on different robots is very rare, and the integration of behavior-based approaches with planning is unsolved. This paper discusses the design, implementation, and performance of a behavior framework that addresses some of these issues within the context of behavior-based and hybrid robot control architectures. The approach presents a step towards more systematic software engineering of behavior-based robot systems.",

We present an algorithm for hierarchical path planning for stochastic tasks, based on Markov decision processes (MDPs) and dynamic programming. It is more efficient than standard dynamic programming for \"flat\" MDPs, because it reduces the state space for all levels in its hierarchy and it allows reuse of previously computed partial policies. This computational advantage comes at the cost of some extra memory and overhead to represent and coordinate the hierarchical system, and in some cases somewhat longer paths to target locations. We demonstrate the method on artificially generated MDP data, and on real robot data from our vision-controlled robot navigating in an office environment.",

Our approach departs from a large collection of omnidirectional images taken at many locations in a building. First, a low-level map is built that consists of a graph in which relations between images are represented. For this, we use a metric based on visual landmarks (SIFT features) and geometrical constraints. Then, we use a graph partitioning method to cluster nodes and in this way construct the high-level map. Experiments on real data show that meaningful higher and lower level maps are obtained, which can be used for accurate localization and planning.",

        "abstract": "The increasing level of requirements in terms of performance, accuracy, repeatability and resolution in the semiconductors industry leads to several technological problems; among them the positioning accuracy and resolution are peculiarly important. In this paper, we address the crucial issue of high resolution and fast positioning mechanisms. We propose a novel type of high resolution and fast positioning mechanism, based on a macro/micro architecture composed of two stages. We focus here on the micro-stage. It is a combination of: a 3-RRR planar parallel structure (3-RRR stands for 3 kinematic chains in parallel, each chain composed of 3 revolute joints R in a serial arrangement) with deported PRR actuation (a rod connected with two revolute joints R to a linear actuator P and to the RRR chain). This architecture provides stiffness, symmetry and interesting thermal properties; Flexible R links (which avoid the drawbacks of conventional links in terms of backlash, friction, wear, stick-slip,...); and near serial-singular configuration which results in an improvement of the resolution. A modeling of inverse kinematics for position and velocity is presented. Then, an optimization is run to find the best set of geometrical parameters for the micro-stage. An articulated kinematic scheme is finally presented.",

        "abstract": "In applications like motion capture, high speed collision testing and robotic manipulation of deformable objects there is a critical need for capturing the 3D geometry of fast moving and/or deforming objects. Although there exists many 3D sensing techniques, most cannot deal with dynamic scenes (e.g., laser scanning). Others, like stereovision, require that object surfaces be appropriately textured. Few, if any, build high-resolution 3D models of dynamic scenes. This paper presents a technique to compute high-resolution range maps from single images of moving and deforming objects. This method is based on observing the deformation of a projected light pattern that combines a set of parallel colored stripes and a perpendicular set of sinusoidal intensity stripes. While the colored stripes allow the sensor to compute absolute depths at coarse resolution, the sinusoidal intensity stripes give dense relative depths. This twofold pattern makes it possible to extract a high-resolution range map from each image in a video sequence. The sensor has been implemented and tested on several deforming objects.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a 32 /spl times/ 32 matrix scan type high-speed pressure sensor for the feet of humanoid robots that has 1 kHz sampling rate. This sensor has matrix scan circuit. The matrix scan method has a problem of interference by bypass current. To resolve this problem, we suggest a novel method using a very thin conductive rubber. We adopted a very thin (0.6 mm) force sensing conductive rubber sheet for high speed sensing. Each sensing area is 4.2 /spl times/ 7.0 mm and can measure vertical force of approximately 0.25-20 N. Walking cycle of humanoid robot as well as human being is about 0.4-0.8 s and dual leg phase is about 0.1-0.15 s. The target of the sensor is biped walk stabilization so that high-speed input is important. Matrix scan type circuit is connected to sensor, and the system runs 1 kHz with 14 bit resolution at 4.2 /spl times/ 7.0 mm grid for 32 /spl times/ 32 points, and the sensor size is the same as humanoid robot foot 135 /spl times/ 228 mm, The system is running high-speed because of the very thin conductive rubber and simultaneous measurement. The sensor system, a novel scan method, and evaluation results are described.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a human posture reconstruction method from the insufficient input posture data based on human posture probability density that is constructed by a long-term human motion capture data. Since the long continuous daily human motion data has high dimensions and becomes huge size, the human posture data should be effectively compressed. The long term posture data has nonlinear distribution on the posture space, since each specific posture such as standing and sitting has different property. The posture data is allocated into some subspaces and compressed for each subspace with mixtures of probabilistic principal component analyzer (MPPCA). MPPCA is improved by replacing conventional EM algorithm with deterministic annealing EM algorithm (DAEM) to avoid initial parameter sensitivity. The posture probability density is constructed over those subspaces. The adequate human posture can be reconstructed from the insufficient data by introducing the posture probability density into the sequential Monte Carlo framework. The experimental results show that the robust human posture estimation can be realized since this method does not estimate the unique posture but estimates the proper posterior posture density with using the posture prior knowledge.",

        "abstract": "Understanding how humans assist each other in haptic interaction teams could lead to improved robotic aids to solo human dextrous manipulation. Inspired by experiments reported in Reed et al. (2004), which suggested two-person haptically interacting teams could achieve a lower movement time (MT) than individuals for discrete aiming movements of specified accuracy, we report that two-person teams (dyads) can also achieve lower MT for cyclical, continuous aiming movements. We propose a model, called endpoint compromise, for how the intended endpoints of both subjects' motion combine during haptic interaction; it predicts a ratio of /spl radic/2 between slopes of MT fits for individuals and dyads. This slope ratio prediction is supported by our data.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel interaction model for a human-robot cooperative task. The CEA (Commands Embedded in Actions) model reduces a human work-load because a user of a robot needs less inputs and outputs than DCM (Direct Commanding methods) like gesturing. We propose ECEA (Extended CEA) in order to deal with more complicated tasks than CEA. On the cooperative sweeping task between a human and a mobile robot, we apply temporal extension as one of ECEA instances. Multiple commands are embedded in the human action by the extension and the robot performs more complicated task. The experiments for conforming reduction of a human work-load using ECEA are conduced on the sweeping task. Human cognitive loads are measured as human workloads and compared between ECEA and DCM. The results of the experiments showed that the ECEA minimized a human cognitive load.",

The improvement of autonomy and mobility is required so that humanoid robot can perform tasks in various environments. Although a humanoid robot has many DOFs, all of them do not have to be controlled depending on the situation and the required tasks. Utilizing rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) as an efficient planning tool, a method of multi-level DOF exploitation is developed that adjusts the controlled DOFs according to the detected environmental situation. That allows the planner to deal with only the necessary sets of DOFs instead of exploring the search space of all the DOFs, which leads to efficient humanoid motion planning. The proposed method is verified through simulations using software platform OpenHRP and HRP-2 humanoid robot model.",

This allows to apply the platform to manifold research and demonstration areas. With his human-like look and mimic possibilities, he differs from other platforms like ASIMO or QRIO, and enables experiments even close to Mori's 'uncanny valley'. The paper describes details of the mechanical and electrical design of BARTHOC together with its PC control interface. Through its humanoid appearance, it can imitate human behavior with its soft- and hardware. Currently, several components for HRI on a mobile robot platform are being ported to BARTHOC. Starting with these components, the robot's human-like appearance enables us to study embodied interaction and to explore theories of human intelligence.",

Recently, we use various types of systems based on electronics. However, these systems are not useful and imposes burden. The electronics for solving these problems are called \"humatronics\". Advanced humatronics are mostly needed for natural communication between human and system. Thus, we think nonverbal communication is basic, and important for communication between human. Moreover, We focus on the networked robotics which is fusion of network technology and robot technology. We constructed nonverbal interface by using human natural motion. In the first experiment, we created commands using hand motion which is based on natural motion, such as becking, hissing away and so on. We constructed robot manipulation system using these commands. Furthermore, we compared the user-friendly of our system with present keyboard manipulation system. In the second experiment, in order to manipulate a robot using more natural motion, we proposed 'pointing movement'. Moreover, we constructed networked robots that recognizes human motion spatially. Accordingly, the user will be able to manipulate the robot with more natural motion in larger space.",

        "abstract": "Energetic autonomy of a hydraulic-based mobile field robot requires a power source capable of both electrical and hydraulic power generation. While the hydraulic power is used for locomotion, the electric power is used for the computer, sensors and other peripherals. An internal combustion engine was used as the prime mover due to the high energy density of gasoline. The primary specification for this hybrid hydraulic-electric power unit (HEPU) is that it must output constant pressure hydraulic power and constant voltage electric power. An on-board computer uses a pressure sensor and a speed sensor to regulate the pressure and voltage by modulating a hydraulic solenoid valve and an engine throttle. The speed regulation also results in a system noise with predictable frequency band which allows for optimal muffler design. A novel characteristic of this power source is its cooling system in which hydraulic fluid is used to cool the engine cylinders. Several hydraulic-electric power units were built and successfully demonstrated on the Berkeley Lower Extremity Exoskeleton (BLEEX) shown on bleex.me.berkeley.edu/bleex.htm. A prototype power unit weighs 27 Kg, outputs 2.3 kW (3.0 hp) hydraulic power at 6.9 MPa (1000 psi), and 220 W of electric power at 15 VDC.",

By combining and merging methodologies from mechanics, system theory, information processing and intelligent control, an accurate and compact method resulted and is substantiated with experimental results achieved on an innovative hexapod PaLiDA. An appropriate form of excitation trajectories helps to overcome classical identification problems, like disturbances in the acceleration signals. The Gauss-Markov estimator is applied for solving the over determined linear equation system. A novel method is presented that uses statistical and uncertainty attributes of the estimate for choosing an optimal structure and parameter number of the dynamics model.",

        "abstract": "Image based rendering (IBR) is one of standard approaches to view synthesis. IBR would be very important for human-robot interface system (HRI) such as a teleoperation system, since the synthesized views are helpful for a human user to understand the robot's operating environment. In this paper, we address the problem of IBR on images taken by a mobile robot. Main difficulty of our problem is that the viewpoint locations of input (real) images are not precisely known, due to estimation errors inherent in the positioning systems. To solve this problem, we will propose a novel IBR method, where the location uncertainty is reduced using a visual landmark, which is commonly used in mobile robotics. In addition, novel priors on real images are introduced to regularize the IBR problem. As a result, IBR can be performed successfully under the location uncertainty.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we report the design and implementation of a sound source separation system using a dynamically reconfigurable device. A robot in real-world environments should have an ability to treat a mixture of multiple sound signals. Active direction-pass filter (ADPF) which extracts sound from a specific direction by using a pair of microphones has been developed as such a method of sound source separation. The ADPF was used as a front-end for an automatic speech recognition system, and recognition of three simultaneous speech signals has been reported. The ADPF, however, requires a lot of computational power, while the battery capacity and the physical size of the robot are limited. To reduce the power consumption and the size of the system, we adopted the dynamically reconfigurable device, DRP developed by NEC Electronics. We implemented the ADPF on DRP, and investigated the effectiveness of dynamically reconfigurable device for these applications. The preliminary experiment shows that ADPF on DRP separates a mixture of sound sources in real-time with practical accuracy.",

Multibeam bathymetry from underwater water vehicles can yield valuable large scale terrain maps of the sea door, but the overall accuracy of these maps is typically limited by the accuracy of the vehicle position estimates. The solution presented here uses small bathymetric patches created over short time scales in a sub-mapping context. These patches are registered with respect to one another and assembled in a single coordinate frame to produce a more accurate terrain estimate and provide improved renavigation of the vehicle trajectory. The mapping is implemented using a delayed state extended Kalman filter (EKF) and results are shown for a real world multibeam data set collected at the mid-Atlantic ridge using the JASON ROV.",

This paper provides a first analysis of the cost estimation process in the TraderBots approach applied to a distributed sensing task. In the presented implementation, path costs are estimated using the D* path planning algorithm with optimistic costing of unknown map cells. The reported results show increased team efficiency when cost estimates reflect different environmental and mission characteristics. Thus, this paper demonstrates that market-based approaches can improve team efficiency if cost estimates take into account environmental and mission characteristics. These findings encourage future research on applying learning techniques for online modification of cost estimation and in market-based coordination.",

This paper describes the effort taken in speeding up the rate of heat transfer of the SMA in ambient environment by introducing a simple, new heat sink, consisting of a combination of an outer metal tube and silicone grease as cooling medium. The SMA wire of diameter 0.3 mm is first coated with a layer of silicone grease, and is inserted into the outer metal tube making sure that the silicone coated SMA does not inhibit the mobility of the outer metal tube. An experimental setting, with the task of using the SMA to vertically haul up a 3kg weight was set up. PWM (pulse width modulation) control was applied to the SMA and by using a position sensor, the rise and fall of weight can be easily monitored, therefore the response speed of the actuator can be observed. Meanwhile a temperature sensor, a thermocouple type-K, was used to monitor the temperature of the SMA for temperature control. Simulation results of the rate of heat transfer based on the heat transfer equation are also presented to validate the effectiveness of this proposed heat sink.",

In this paper we present an approach that simultaneously uses color and range information to cluster 3D points into planar structures. Our current system also is able to calibrate the camera and the laser based on the remission values provided by the range scanner and the brightness of the pixels in the image. It has been implemented on a mobile robot equipped with a manipulator that carries a range scanner and a camera for acquiring colored range scans. Several experiments carried out on real data and in simulations demonstrate that our approach yields highly accurate results also in comparison with previous approaches.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an in vitro patient-tailored biological model of human cerebral artery, an innovative platform for simulating intravascular neurosurgery to evaluate medical robots and devices. This anatomically accurate model reproduces 3-dimensional configuration of individual arteries with an artery-like thin membranous structure made of silicone elastomer. Its modeling resolution is 13 /spl mu/m. Presented modeling methodology also allows constructing any hollow structure, which is suitable for robot evaluations, making use of CAD. Presented model also reproduces the physical properties of arterial tissue with errors less than 5% (that include elastic modulus, poisson's ratio and frictional coefficient). Thus the cerebral arterial model reproduces not only the behavior of arteries caused by surgical operations, but also the dynamic behavior of surgical robots and devices (e.g. elastic deformation and slip/stick motion). Furthermore, we also propose a novel method that allows developers to evaluate 3-dimensional stress condition on arterial wall, which is caused by surgical operations, by making use of the photoelastic effect. As there are almost no realistic hardware platform enough to fairly evaluate medical robots and devices, it should provide an advanced testing environment for developing robots and other various medical equipments, especially for intravascular neurosurgery.",

We propose a new approach to merging robots' maps that is composed of a local geometric process of merging similar line segments (termed discrete segment evolution) with a global statistical control process. In the case of single robot, we are able to incrementally build a map showing the environment the robot has traveled through by merging its polygonal map with actual scans. In the case of a robot team, we are able to identify common parts of their partial maps and if common parts are present construct a joint map of the explored environment.",

Automatic creation of such maps is still problematic if the robot tries to map large environments. This paper presents a new method for incremental mapping using fingerprints of places. This type of representation permits a reliable, compact, and distinctive environment-modeling and makes navigation and localization easier for the robot.

With this algorithm we obtain a minimum calibration effort. We demonstrate that this system is useful to navigate in indoor environments with a real robot. Some experimental results are shown.

A nonconventional method was considered to model the flexibility of the fins of cuttlefish or stingray. A two-degree-of-freedom linkage was designed and constructed to mimic the actual flexible fin. Several linkages were used to form a mechanical fin consisting of several fin segments, which are able to produce undulations, similar to those produced by the actual fins. A number of experiments were carried out on the mechanical fin attached to a buoyant tank, which mimics a fish. The results were found consistent with anguilliform swimming behavior.",

In this way, the robot is able to reason about the uncertainty in its belief about people in the vicinity and is able to shift its attention between different persons. Even people who are not the primary conversational partners are included into the interaction. In practical experiments with a humanoid robot, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the compliant task generator: a new approach for the automatic conversion of a geometric path generated by a compliant path planner to a force based task specification for a compliant robot controller. Based on the geometric model of a moving object and its environment, a compliant path planner generates a set of six-dimensional positions x/sub 1...m/ and their corresponding contact formations CF/sub 1...n/. The compliant force controller, which executes a planned path under force feedback using the hybrid control paradigm, expects a desired force w/sub d/, velocity t/sub d/ and position x/sub d/ at each time-step, together with their force and velocity controlled subspaces W and T. To specify these controller primitives, we add information about the desired dynamic interaction between the moving object and its environment, in the form of the desired kinetic energy E/sub kin/ of the moving object and the potential energy E/sub pot/ in the contacts with the environment, together with the inertia and stiffness matrix M and S. We fully automated the conversion process of the compliant planner output together with the added information about the dynamic interaction, to a force based task specification. This eliminates the requirement of human intervention between the planning and execution phase. The presented approach applies to all compliant motions between polyhedral objects, and is verified in a real world experiment.",

If the environments surrounding us could recognize our activities indirectly by sensors, the novel services, which respect our activities, can be possible. In this paper, we propose human activity recognition system, which infers the next human action by taking account of the past human behaviors observed so far. We also developed cooking support system by using an LCD touch panel on the kitchen counter and a mobile robot on the floor, which suggest what the human should do next by voice and gestures. Experimental results confirmed the feasibility of the inference system and the quality of support.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes how to implement interactive evolutionary computation (IEC) into a human-robot communication system. IEC is an evolutionary computation (EC) in which the fitness function is performed by human assessors. We used IEC to configure the human-robot communication system. We have already simulated IEC's application. In this paper, we implemented IEC into a real robot. Since this experiment leads considerable burdens on both the robot and experimental subjects, we propose the human-machine hybrid evaluation (HMHE) to increase the diversity within the genetic pool without increasing the number of interactions. We used a communication robot, WAMOEBA-3 (Waseda artificial mind on emotion base), which is appropriate for this experiment. In the experiment, human assessors interacted with WAMOEBA-3 in various ways. The fitness values increased gradually, and assessors felt the robot learnt the motions they desired. Therefore, it was confirmed that the IEC is most suitable as the communication learning system.",

        "abstract": "Natural human-robot interaction (HRI) is a key feature of mobile robot companions collaborating with humans. To achieve natural HRI, multiple communication modalities like vision, speech, and gestures have to be utilized. Besides, capabilities to emulate cognitive processes, e.g., object learning and object recognition, are essential. In this work we present a new approach to interactive object learning enabling multi-view object representation. To overcome a robot's limitation of having only one view point, we make use of an iconic memory consisting of previously acquired images. As the relevant scene area is unknown during construction of the iconic memory, a representation in the form of mosaic images is applied. The relevant image patches describing an object referenced by the user are selected through an object attention mechanism. The resulting multi-view object representations improve the flexibility of our interactive approach for object learning.",

        "abstract": "Real-time applications ask for reduced computational cost algorithms. In robotic exploration of unstructured environments the problem is more challenging: several tasks, at the same time, must be carried on ranging from reactive behaviours to the building of a structured representation of the environment itself. Many sensor signals have to be processed at each step to estimate both landmarks and robot positions. This mapping aptitude can be implemented through an extended Kalman filter recently proposed in a previous paper. Due to the large number of estimated variables, and real-time constraints, the filter is better implemented in its interlaced version. The novelty of this paper consists in extending the IEKF filter, removing some hypothesis on the linearity of both state transition and observation mapping, in order to further reduce computational burden and then achieve a better tradeoff among computational load and accuracy.",

The catadioptric image formation is modeled with a two-step mapping via the sphere using the conformal geometric algebra. Also, the projective invariants are calculated using the conformal geometric algebra. Furthermore, we show that the projective invariants in a plane are equivalent to the invariants of circles in the unit sphere. This equivalence induces us to project features from the catadioptric image to the sphere, calculate their invariants and use these invariants to recognize objects.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Artificial neural networks have been traditionally employed to learn and compute the inverse kinematics of a robotic arm. However, the inverse kinematics model of a typical robotic arm with joint limits is a multi-valued and discontinuous function. Because it is difficult for a multilayer neural network to approximate this type of function, an accurate inverse kinematics model cannot be obtained by using a single neural network. In order to overcome the difficulties of inverse kinematics learning, we propose a novel modular neural network system that consists of a number of expert modules, where each expert approximates a continuous part of the inverse kinematics function. The proposed system selects one appropriate expert whose output minimizes the expected position/orientation error of the end-effector of the arm. The system can learn a precise inverse kinematics model of a robotic arm with equal or more degrees of freedom than that of its end-effector. However, there are robotic arms with fewer degrees of freedom, where the system cannot learn their precise inverse kinematics model. We have adopted a modified Gauss-Newton method for finding the least-squares solution to address this issue. Through the modifications presented in this paper, the improved modular neural network system can obtain a precise inverse kinematics model of a general robotic arm.",

Motion planning has application in many areas such as robotics, virtual reality systems, computer-aided design, and even computational biology. Although there have been steady advances in motion planning algorithms, especially in randomized approaches such as probabilistic roadmap methods (PRMs) or rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs), there are still some classes of problems that cannot be solved efficiently using these state-of-the-art motion planners. In this paper, we suggest an iterative strategy addressing this problem where we first simplify the problem by relaxing some feasibility constraints, solve the easier version of the problem, and then use that solution to help us find a solution for the harder problem. We show how this strategy can be applied to rigid bodies and to linkages with high degrees of freedom, including both open and closed chain systems. Experimental results are presented for linkages composed of 9-98 links. Although we use PRMs as the automated planner, the framework is general and can be applied with other motion planning techniques as well.",

Prior planning algorithms have addressed this in part, but there are few fast ways of working with more than just a few constraints. Extending algorithms designed for one constraint to multiple constraints is difficult due to the NP complete nature of the problem, prompting a switch to an approximation algorithm. This paper presents K2, a multiply-constrained planning algorithm which is an amalgamation of parts of H/spl I.bar/MCOP and Focussed D*. It accepts additive constraints over the path or over any fixed length section of the path. K2 operates quickly and produces results of acceptable quality.",

After presenting the most popular of them and showing its limitations, we introduce some new Kalman filters in order to compare them in the vehicle localization context. This comparison is based on the sole use of their predictive steps that corresponds to the worst case that it can occur in vehicle localization (corrective data are unavailable).",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a method to control Kendama by casting manipulation. Casting manipulation is a technique to control an end-effector in the air by throwing the end-effector and controlling its ballistic flight using impulsive forces transmitted through a light string connected to the end-effector itself. First, we examine dynamic characteristics of a flexible string against impulsive force. We propose a method of identifying the viscoelastic model parameters of the string through free-fall experiments. Then the technique of braking the string is applied to the trajectory control with consideration of the time delay and slip of the brake. We conduct the rebound experiments by the braking technique to confirm its effectiveness. We analyse the work space where the suitable motion of end-effector for Kendama game is generated by multiple braking. Kendama game, motion of making the perforated ball impaled on the stick, is demonstrated by casting manipulator hardware.",

Two alternative designs for the serial sub-chain are suggested and compared. The first design employs RU joint arrangement for the serial sub chain structure. The second design incorporates a gear chain to drive the distal revolute joint of the serial sub-chain from the base platform of the mechanism. This modification significantly improves kinematic characteristics of the mechanism within its workspace. Firstly, the closed-form solutions of both the forward and the reverse position analysis are derived. Secondly, the first-order kinematic model with respect to three inputs which are located at the base is derived. Thirdly, it is confirmed through simulation that the modified mechanism has much more improved isotropic characteristic throughout the workspace of the mechanism. Lastly, the proposed mechanism is implemented to verify the results from this analysis.",

When the large-scale motion can not be accomplished only by rolling and sliding of the finger, finger gaiting, or regrasping, is used. In this paper, we propose a joint space representation of grasps, which represents a stable grasp by a set of joints values with several grasping constraints. Using primitives describing the regrasping process with the joint space representation, we build a kinematic model of finger gaiting as a hybrid automaton, by using which all grasping constraints are involved. Then, a simple but representative simulation is setup, whose results verify the validity and efficiency of the model. Finally, we state several interesting future works, which can greatly be extended based on the hybrid automaton we proposed in this paper.",

Our method avoids searching for point associations by simply matching points with the same bearing. This association rule enables the construction of an algorithm faster than the iterative closest point (ICP). Firstly the PSM approach is tested with simulated laser scans. Then the accuracy of our matching algorithm is evaluated from real laser scans from known relative positions to establish a ground truth. Furthermore, to demonstrate the practical usability of the new PSM approach, experimental results from a Kalman filter implementation of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) are provided.",

In the more general case of non-convex polygons (not necessarily nested), the algorithm finds the exact optimum tour in O(n/sup 2/m + m/sup 3/) time and O(n/sup 2/ + m/sup 2/) space.

The LBD system consists of an ultrasonic location sensing system developed by the authors and an educational content server. The location of the student is monitored by ultrasonic sensors embedded around the learning room. The system voices English verbs related to objects around the student so that the student can obtain the language skills for expressing various activities of everyday life in English by performing real-world behaviors. The system was implemented experimentally in an English language school. Six subjects participated in an experiment evaluating the educational efficacy of the proposed system. Recall rates of learned verbs were compared among three methodologies, \"learning by text,\" \"learning by pictures and text,\" and \"learning by doing\". Recall rates were measured at the following intervals: soon after the learning task, 2 days after, 4 days after, 7 days after, and 14 days after the learning task. The results indicate that the proposed LBD system increased the recall rate of learned words by 113% 14 days after the learning task. Overall, the system significantly increased the average recall rate by 102% in comparison to the other learning methodologies.",

        "abstract": "We propose a nonlinear method for learning the low-dimensional pose of a robot from high-dimensional panoramic images. The panoramic images are assumed to lie on a nonlinear low-dimensional appearance manifold that is embedded in a high-dimensional image space. We demonstrate that the local geometry of a point and its nearest neighbors on this manifold can be used to project the point onto a low-dimensional coordinate space. Using this embedding, the unknown camera position can be estimated from a novel panoramic image. We show how the image-based position measurements can be integrated with odometry information in a Bayesian framework to yield an online estimate of a robot's position. Results from simulated data show that the proposed method outperforms other appearance-based models based upon principal components analysis and kernel density estimation.",

        "abstract": "The two most important abilities for a robot to survive in a given environment are selecting and learning the most appropriate actions in a given situation. Historically, they have also been the biggest problems in robotics. To help solve this problem, we propose a two-layered action selection mechanism (ASM) which designates an action pattern layer and a reactive behavior plan layer. In the reactive behavior plan layer, a task is selected by comparing behavior motivation values that, in an animal, correspond to external stimuli as well as internal states due to hormones. After a task is selected, its corresponding reactive behavior plan is executed as a set of sequential dynamic behavior motivations (DBMs), each of which is associated with an action pattern. In the action pattern layer, each action pattern can be functionally decomposed into primitive motor actions. Shortest path-based Q-learning (SPQL) is incorporated into both the reactive behavior plan and action pattern layers. In the reactive behavior plan layer, relationships between perceptions and action patterns are learned to satisfy a given motivation, as well as the relative priorities of these relationships. In the action pattern layer, the relations between sensory states and primitive motor actions can be learned. To establish the validity of our proposed ASM, experiments with our real designed robot was illustrated together with simulations.",

The robot is a 5 DOF self-containing manipulator, that includes on-board all the control system. The main advantage of the robot is its light weight, about 11 kg for a 1.3m reach. The robot is totally autonomous and needs only power supply to be operated. The robot is a symmetrical arm able to move (or to climb) between different points (docking stations) of the rooms and, if it is necessary, \"jump\" to (or from) the environment to the wheelchair. In this way the MATS robot should become a home companion and assistance for numerous persons. This paper presents the live experimentation of the robot. Different tasks have been tested such as: eating, shaving, making-up, etc.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we consider the problem of maintaining surveillance of a moving the target by a nonholonomic mobile observer. The observer's goal is to maintain visibility of the target from a predefined, fixed distance, l. The target escapes if (a) it moves behind an obstacle to occlude the observer's view, (b) it causes the observer to collide with an obstacle, or (c) it exploits the nonholonomic constraints on the observer motion to increase its distance from the observer beyond the surveillance distance l. We deal specifically with the situation in which the only constraint on the target's velocity is a bound on speed (i.e., there are no nonholonomic constraints on the target's motion), and the observer is a nonholonomic, differential drive system having bounded speed. We develop the system model, from which we derive a lower bound for the required observer speed. Finally, we consider the effect of obstacles on the observer's ability to successfully track the target.",

        "abstract": "A humanoid robot under real-world environments usually hears mixtures of sounds, and thus three capabilities are essential for robot audition; sound source localization, separation, and recognition of separated sounds. We have adopted the missing feature theory (MFT) for automatic recognition of separated speech, and developed the robot audition system. A microphone array is used along with a real-time dedicated implementation of geometric source separation (GSS) and a multi-channel post-filter that gives us a further reduction of interferences from other sources. The automatic speech recognition based on MFT recognizes separated sounds by generating missing feature masks automatically from the post-filtering step. The main advantage of this approach for humanoid robots resides in the fact that the ASR with a clean acoustic model can adapt the distortion of separated sound by consulting the post-filter feature masks. In this paper, we used the improved Julius as an MFT-based automatic speech recognizer (ASR). The Julius is a real-time large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) system. We performed the experiment to evaluate our robot audition system. In this experiment, the system recognizes a sentence, not an isolated word. We showed the improvement in the system performance through three simultaneous speech recognition on the humanoid SIG2.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores how the absence of an expected sensor reading can be used to improve Markov localization. This negative information usually is not being used in localization, because it yields less information than positive information (i.e. sensing a landmark), and a sensor often fails to detect a landmark, even if it falls within its sensing range. We address these difficulties by carefully modeling the sensor to avoid false negatives. This can also be thought of as adding an additional sensor that detects the absence of an expected landmark. We show how such modeling is done and how it is integrated into Markov localization. In real world experiments, we demonstrate that a robot is able to localize in positions where otherwise it could not and quantify our findings using the entropy of the particle distribution. Exploiting negative information leads to a greatly improved localization performance and reactivity.",

This method guarantees the dynamic stability of the system and does not require any object models and object sensing to manipulate the object. It is assumed that there is no friction between the object and the horizontal plane and it is possible to be adequately large friction between the fingertips and the object. We examine the condition of stable grasping of a circular object and propose controllers for stable grasping and for controlling its approximate relative orientation angle without object sensing.

        "abstract": "In this paper, the mechanical properties of yeast cell are determined by means of the developed two-fingered micro hand and an atomic force microscope (AFM). The micro hand has excellent absolute positioning accuracy after the elaborated calibration, and is typically capable of obtaining less than several hundred nanometer of positioning accuracy by human tele-operation. The authors also developed an AFM system of our own composition. The AFM consists of a laser diode module, a cantilever, a 4-segment photodiode and output circuit. The task to measure the mechanical properties of cells include moving of the fingers from the home position to the target object (cell), then picking and grasping it, moving it to a target position (AFM tip), and finally pushing it against the cantilever tip. However, since it is difficult to stabilize the sample, the authors utilized the capillary phenomenon, i.e. the liquid inside the tube-shaped object ascends the inner wall in order to stabilize the sample strongly. And force-indentation relation was obtained applying a force to individual yeast cells by moving the sample to the cantilever tip. Force is automatically calculated from the cantilever deflection measured with a laser beam and a quadrature photodiode, while indentation is obtained from the difference between the movement of the micro hand and that of the cantilever tip caused by cantilever deflection. The mechanical properties of yeast cells is finally determined using the produced force-indentation curves, the Hertz model and FIEL (force indentation to equal limits) mapping, which is an analytical way for determining relative microelastic properties from force volumes of viscoelastic materials.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with mechanical stiffness control of multi-DOF joint. It fundamentally mimics skeleton-muscular system of human articulation, in which at least two muscles cooperatively handle one DOF under their antagonistic action. In the first part of the paper one describes a novel actuator called ANLES (actuator with non-linear elastic system) that mimics a skeletal muscle in the sense of having a non-linear elasticity. Next one introduces a basic formula for controlling stiffness of the joint as well as its angles using multiple ANLESes. It follows the evaluation of the proposed formula by the simulation analysis. Three DOF joint manipulated by six or eight tendons that are individually controlled by the ANLES is evaluated with respect to the stiffness control.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to analyze the mechanics of object pulling by more than one robot using flexible tools such as rope. The concept of nonprehensile pulling where an object is not completely tied by a rope such that an object can roll or slide along the rope is the main focus of this study. The necessary condition for a stable nonprehensile pulling is defined. The mechanics of nonprehensile pulling is used to define the set of feasible motion directions of the object. This set of feasible motion directions of the object is then used for planning the coordination between two robots such that the task of object transportation can be achieved. The proposed analysis can also be extended for multiple objects transportation. This study provides a necessary basis required in developing an algorithm for a group of robots to autonomously cooperate such that the pulled object can be positioned and oriented in the 2D space.",

The authors focused on the tongue because of its \"flexibility\" and \"soft motion.\" The robot performs motions characteristic of the tongue: i.e., up-down and right-left motion of tip, and up-down, right-left, twisting, and circular motion of the whole. The robot's forms were defined as a 1D form (a shape like a string), a 2D form (a shape like a sheet of paper), and a 3D form (a solid structure). In Stage 1, the robot consists of three parts: the tip, the body, and the base. This robot enabled realization of basic motion and 1-2D form. To transform 3D form, the whole robot will be built up from the basic units. Basic unit is tip part mechanisms in Stage 1. The basic formula for controlling the basic unit is indispensable in designing a robot from basic units. Thus, the basic formula was sought. Moreover, the basic unit was evaluated using the basic formula.",

We define a formalism called the Bayesian map, which allows incremental building of models, thanks to the superposition operator, which is a formally well-defined operator. Firstly, we present a syntactic version of this operator, and secondly, a version where the previously obtained model is enriched by experimental learning. In the resulting map, locations are the conjunction of underlying possible locations, which allows for more precise localization and more complex tasks. A theoretical example validates the concept, and hints at its usefulness for realistic robotic scenarios.",

This assumption is not reasonable for many applications such as planetary rovers or robotics which cope with much uncertainty about the duration of tasks, the energy, and the data storage. In this paper, we outline an approach to control the operation of an autonomous rover which operates under multiple resource constraints. We consider a directed acyclic graph of progressive processing tasks with multiple resources, for which an optimal policy is obtained by solving a corresponding Markov decision process (MDP). Computing an optimal policy for an MDP with multiple resources makes the search space large. We cannot calculate this optimal policy at run-time. The approach developed in this paper overcomes this difficulty by combining: decomposition of a large MDP into smaller ones, compression of the state space by exploiting characteristics of the multiple resources constraint, construction of local policies for the decomposed MDPs using state space discretization and resource compression, and recomposition of the local policies to obtain a near optimal global policy. Finally, we present first experimental results showing the feasibility and performances of our approach.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The development of a practical motion planning and control algorithm for under-actuated robots in an unknown disturbance is a very important issue in robotics research. In the case of under actuated underwater vehicles, developing such an algorithm has been particularly problematic for several reasons. First, not only the kinematical characteristics of the motion but also the dynamical characteristics of the underwater vehicle must be considered in the motion planning calculation. Second, it is very difficult to ascertain the exact distribution of the velocity of non-uniform sea flow around obstacles on the seabed before the mission. Third, the effect of the sea flow on the motion of an underwater vehicle is very large because the speed of sea flow is very high compared with the vehicle's. This paper proposes a new method based on the application of reinforcement learning to solve these problems. Reinforcement learning based on the Markov decision process (MDP) is known to be suitable for acquiring motion control algorithms for robots acting in a stochastic environment with disturbance. However, to apply reinforcement learning method, the robot's motion must be suitably digitized and the learning environment must be equal to the robot's mission environment. This paper introduces a motion digitizing method based on an artificial neuron model and a method for making up for the difference between learning and mission environments. The performance of the proposed algorithm is examined by the dynamical simulation of an under-actuated underwater vehicle cruising in an environment with an obstacle and an unknown non-uniform flow simulated by potential flow.",

        "abstract": "Low-cost inertial measurement units (IMUs) are increasingly becoming commercially available and the use of IMUs in autonomous vehicle applications has increased rapidly in the past decade. IMUs are subject to various errors, such as biases, drifts, nonlinearities, scale factors and noise. The noise is produced by various sources, such as thermal and vibrational disturbances. Noise estimation is critical in accurate inertial navigation systems (INS). The main contribution of this paper is that a noise analysis of the raw accelerations measured by IMUs during signal presence (i.e, an acceleration caused by a specific force) or absence (when the IMU undergoes constant velocity) is carried out to reduce these noise components, which corrupt the inertial data. After noise reduction, multi-aiding information from odometry, a single-axis gyroscope and vehicle constraints is utilized to bound the error growth of the inertial data and produce a reliable outdoor localization system. Experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the noise reduction method and the improved accuracy of the multi-aided INS.",

We investigate the minimal capabilities of a microrobot which still enable the whole robotic group to perform collective activities. These minimal capabilities are implemented in the hardware which allows exploring a phenomenon of swarm intelligence in real experiments. The components of the developed system consume energy provided by microcontroller's I/O ports, are cheap and available on micro-component market.",

This work addresses the question of the optimal placement of cameras to maximize the performance of these types of recognition tasks. Specifically, our goal is to optimize the quality of the joint observability of the tasks being performed by the subjects in an area. We develop a general analytical formulation of the observation problem, in terms of the statistics of the motion in the scene and the total resolution of the observed actions that is applicable to many observation tasks and multi-camera systems. A nonlinear optimization approach is used to find the internal and external (mounting position and orientation) camera parameters that optimize the recognition criteria. In these experiments, a single camera is repositioned using a mobile robot. Initial results for the problem of human activity recognition are presented.",

Then, software issues are also discussed, related to the techniques that are necessary in order to navigate and to reliably manipulate books in a library. In this context, two methods are presented, concerning visual tracking and force/vision control. The first one is aimed at locating a book in a bookshelf by means of vision. For this, a tracking algorithm is implemented, which takes into account the spatio-temporal constraints of the problem. Book tags are located in the image and processed using open source optical character recognition (OCR) software, until the desired book is found. The second of the methods addresses the problem of extracting the book from the shelf. A hybrid force/vision control algorithm has been implemented, which uses vision for guiding the gripper to the correct book, and force for detecting contacts.",

In traditional expression recognition methods using shape features, there are problems in describing both the uncertainty in facial expression classification and the relationship between facial features and facial expressions. Using facial expression space model, those problems can be solved easily. Firstly, we use values of fuzzy integral in different facial expression spaces to describe the uncertainty of facial expression. Secondly, by the fuzzy measure automatically constructed in each facial expression space, we deal with different effects of facial features for facial expression classification. Experiments show this method has a good ability of describing the uncertainty of facial expression and acquires good results of classification.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with the emotional model of the software-robot. The software-robot requires several capabilities such as sensing, perceiving, acting, communicating, surviving and so on. There are already many studies about the emotional model like KISMET, AIBO. Though many emotional models are implemented, their human response architectures are invariant as time passes. Conventional emotional models make a robot like and obey a human during robot operation. This is natural for robots which are used in industrial, service and military areas but for pet robots this property lets robot look like real robots not real pets. Actually, a robot's emotional model is studied to implement robot intelligence more easily but emotion expression has to be exaggerated in a pet robot to make it interesting to humans. Pet robots must show dynamical emotion variations. The emotional model with the modified friendship is studied in this paper to overcome the conventional emotional model's limits to apply to pet robots. Friendship is distinguished as positive, negative and static schemes and an emotional model with the modified friendship is implemented and simulated on a software-robot.",

A quasi-linear model, developed to describe the behavior of human hand pads and, more generally, of biological tissues, is adopted in order to overcome the problems tied to classical (linear) models, often used in the robotic field. Through experimental tests, the values of the parameters of this model have been found for two different materials (a polyurethane gel and a silicon rubber) which show a behavior similar to that of human pads and seem very suitable for robotic applications. Finally, the model has been extended with the use of digital filters, making the identification process very straightforward.",

The motion of the microparticle is performed and controlled by an external magnetic field. In this paper, we present the modelling of the pusher behavior. Our model is composed of a magnetic block (internal magnetic micropusher behaviour), strain block (torque and force applied on the micropusher by the magnet) and dynamic block (dynamic micropusher behaviour).

        "abstract": "Telepresence aims at giving a human user the impression of being present in a remote environment. However, the user is actually situated in a user environment and his motion is tracked. A mobile teleoperator in the remote environment replicates this motion. The user can thus control the mobile teleoperator's locomotion by walking. A stereo-camera system mounted on the mobile teleoperator constantly records live camera images and transfers them to the user environment, where they are presented to the user on a head-mounted display. This paper presents a long distance experiment, in which a mobile teleoperator was controlled over a standard Internet connection by natural locomotion. Without further processing of the user's motion data, however, only exploration of a remote environment of the same size or smaller than the user environment is possible. As this is not desirable, we use motion compression, an optimal nonlinear transformation of the user's path. This algorithm allows controlling free motion in an arbitrarily large target environment from a limited user environment.",

        "abstract": "For a large scale object, scanning from the air is one of the most efficient methods of obtaining 3D data. In the case of large cultural heritage objects, there are some difficulties in scanning them with respect to safety and efficiency. To remedy these problems, we have been developing a novel 3D measurement system, the floating laser range sensor (FLRS), in which a rage sensor is suspended beneath a balloon. The obtained data, however, have some distortion due to the intra-scanning movement. In this paper, we propose a method to recover 3D range data obtained by a moving laser range sensor; this method is applicable not only to our FLRS, but also to a general moving range sensor. Using image sequences from a video camera mounted on the FLRS enables us to estimate the motion of the FLRS without any physical sensors such as gyros and GPS. At first, the initial values of camera motion parameters are estimated by perspective factorization. The next stage refines camera motion parameters using the relationships between camera images and the range data distortion. Finally, by using the refined parameter, the distorted range data are recovered. We applied this method to an actual scanning project and the results showed the effectiveness of our method.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of how a humanoid robot can step over a given obstacle. Obstacle stepping-over has two aspects, namely, feasibility analysis and motion planning. The former determines whether the robot can step over the obstacle, and the latter discusses how to realize the stepping-over, if it is feasible, by trajectory planning. The paper focuses on the latter. Specifically, based on our previous analysis of feasibility, we present a novel algorithm to plan suitable trajectories for obstacle stepping-over, taking into account two basic requirements. The first requirement is to avoid any collision between the robot and the obstacle, and the second to maintain stability or balance of the robot. To meet them, we decompose the whole body motion of the robot into two parts, corresponding to the upper body motion and the lower body, respectively. We first plan collision-free trajectories of the feet and the waist for lower body motion, and then adjust upper body motion by resolved momentum control to guarantee the robot stability. This novel planning method is adaptive to obstacle sizes and hence oriented to autonomous stepping-over of humanoid robots guided by vision or other range finders. Its effectiveness is shown by simulation and experiment on our humanoid platform HRP-2.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with motion planning algorithms for the large space robot manipulators with complicated dynamic behavior. We propose two \"two-stage\" iterative algorithms, which provide collision-free robot motion taking into account robot's dynamics. The approach is based on new efficient methods for robot manipulator dynamics simulation and probabilistic methods for motion planning in highly cluttered environments. The algorithms are applicable for the robot manipulators of general class with arbitrary kinematics and dynamics parameters. We have demonstrated the approach for a particular task of servicing the satellite by a large space manipulator. This task is one of the most challenging since large space manipulators have extremely complicated dynamic behavior caused by elasticity of their structure, huge payloads they work with and zero-gravity conditions. Experiments involving a 15.5 meters long manipulator carrying a satellite inside a space shuttle with clearance less than 3 cm are presented. Several movies demonstrate the results.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses a method for robot motion planning in dynamic environments, avoiding the moving and static obstacles while the robot drives towards the goal. The method maps the dynamic environment into a velocity space, using the concept of estimated arriving time to compute the times to potential collision and potential escape. The problem of finding the best motion command is directly treated in the velocity space, providing the trajectory which satisfies an optimization criterium (typically the minimum time or the shortest path). In this work the method is applied to robots which are subject to both kinematic constraints (i.e. involving the configuration parameters of the robot and their derivatives), and dynamic constraints, (i.e. the constraints imposed by the dynamics of the robot and the limits of its actuators). Some experimental results are discussed.",

Due to the complex airflow induced by the four interacting rotors, classical linear techniques failed to provide sufficient stability. Integral sliding mode and reinforcement learning control are presented as two design techniques for accommodating the nonlinear disturbances. The methods both result in greatly improved performance over classical control techniques.",

This paper presents a multilateral adaptive nonlinear control architecture for cooperative teleoperation. The proposed framework allows for transmission of position and force information between all master and slave robots rather than merely between corresponding units. An adaptive nonlinear controller establishes kinematic correspondence among masters and slaves. The operators are presented with a virtual intervening tool in order to collaboratively interact with the environment. Models of operators, master and slave robots, tool, and environment are incorporated in the design. The stability of the system in the presence of parametric uncertainty in the dynamics is proven via Lyapunov analysis. Simulation and experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed approach is highly effective in all phases of a teleoperation task, i.e. in free motion, in contact with a flexible environment, and in contact with a rigid environment.",

Instead of solving a set of nonlinear equations for the forward kinematics, neural networks are used to map the input angles of revolute joints to the orientation of the manipulator. The training data are obtained from inverse kinematic relationships and measured from the experimental prototype model of the manipulator. Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is used to train the neural networks, which leads to the fast convergence of the networks. The trained neural network model of forward kinematics are used in the real time interface between the graphical model and a haptic device for the laparoscopes surgery training application.

        "abstract": "In this paper we consider the problem of navigating a team of input constraint robotic agents. The main motivation comes from the field of micro-robotics, where several input sets are more favorable than others, in the sense of incurring a lower relative actuation error. A switching controller that actuates the system in those favored input regions is derived based on Multirobot Navigation Functions. The system is shown to possess theoretically guaranteed global convergence and collision avoidance properties. Non-trivial computer simulations show the effectiveness of the methodology.",

        "abstract": "The main contribution of this paper is an algorithm for integrating motion planning and simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM). Accuracy of the maps and the robot locations computed using SLAM is strongly dependent on the characteristics of the environment, for example feature density, as well as the speed and direction of motion of the robot. Appropriate control of the robot motion is particularly important in bearing-only SLAM, where the information from a moving sensor is essential. In this paper a near minimum time path planning algorithm with a finite planning horizon is proposed for bearing-only SLAM. The objective of the algorithm is to achieve a predefined mapping precision while maintaining acceptable vehicle location uncertainty in the minimum time. Simulation results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

A Widrow-Hoff neural network (NN) with a learning algorithm derived by applying Lyapunov approach is introduced for this problem. Since the inverse kinematics has infinite number of joint angle vectors, a fuzzy neural network (FNN) is designed to provide an approximate value for that vector. This vector is fed into the NN as a hint input vector to guide the output of the NN within the self-motion. This FNN is designed based on cooperatively controlling each joint angle of the manipulator. The joint velocity limits as well as the joint limits are incorporated into this method. Experiments are conducted for the PA-10 redundant arm to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control system. A comparative study is made with the gradient projection method.",

In the proposed SSA, noise reduction is achieved by subtracting the estimated noise power spectrum from the target speech power spectrum to be enhanced in the mel-scale filter bank domain. This offers a realization of error-robust spatial spectral subtraction with few computational complexities. In addition, we introduce known noise superimposition technique in the mel-scale filter bank domain, and utilize the matched acoustic model for the known noise. This can compensate the acoustic model mismatch and mask the residual noise component in SSA. The experimental results obtained under a real environment reveal that word accuracy of the proposed method is greater than that of the conventional method even when the target user moves between -10 and +10 degrees around the microphone array.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the control of a leader-follower formation where the leader robot has its own target and the follower robots are constrained by the specified formation tasks. The dynamics of the leader robot with nonholonomic constraint is explicitly integrated into the formation system to yield a centralized coordinating controller. As a result there is no need to assume the motion of the leader separatively when we develop cooperative formation controllers for coordinating the robots. The feedback linearization is used to deal with the nonlinear formation control of a team of autonomous mobile robots with nonholonomic constraints. Although the nonlinear formation system under consideration can be exactly linearized by taking advantage of dynamic feedback linearization, there exists structural singularity which may pose serious problems in practice. To solve this singular problem a new formation model for controlling the leader-follower formation in a cooperative manner is developed. This new formation model can be extended to studying other control and learning issues in multi-robot systems for both cooperation and noncooperation. The internal dynamics is derived and proven to be globally stable under the stable linear controller obtained via the partially linearized dynamics. To demonstrate the performance of the developed formation controller, simulation results are provided.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a novel haptic mouse system which conveys kinesthetic and tactile information simultaneously in virtual environments. The haptic mouse system can provide 2-DOF translational force feedback, vibration, normal pressure, skin stretch and thermal feedback, all of which are important physical quantities of sensing object's shape, stiffness and surface properties. The system can simulate small scale shapes and roughness of surface textures using cutaneous cues generated by individual drives of a 6/spl times/8 pin array. Since thermal differences among surfaces of virtual objects is one of dominant factors in perceiving texture, a thermal feedback unit composed of a heat conduction plate and a temperature sensor is also embedded into the tactile display system. The developed system can be used as a testbed in psychophysical study on tactile perception. We have investigated the influence of the frequency variation on perceived roughness using the haptic mouse system since vibrotaction has been considered as a key factor affecting perception of fine textures by physiology researchers. In order to find out the relation of roughness and vibration, two psychophysical experiments have been performed. The correlation between the vibration frequency and the texture shows that there are certain transitions of perceived roughness. The experimental results yield that the vibrating stimulus is more effective for displaying a fine surface than static displacement display, and it shows a possibility to display finer texture, exceeding the physical limitation of the device.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In our previous work, an obstacle avoidance algorithm, which used potential fields and a similar strategy to that adopted by a blind person to avoid obstacles whilst walking, was proposed. The problem analyzed consists of an AGV (autonomous guided vehicle) which moves within an office environment with a known floor plan and uses an \"electronic stick\" made up of infrared sensors to detect unknown obstacles in its path. Initially, a global potential navigation function, defined for each room in the floor plan, incorporates information about the dimensions of the room and the position of the door which the AGV must use to leave the room. Whilst the AGV moves, this global potential navigation function is properly modified to incorporate information about any newly detected obstacle. The main interesting aspect of the proposed approach is that the potential function adaptation involves very low computational burden allowing for the use of ultra-fast AGVs. Other distinctive features of the algorithm are that it is free from local minima, the obstacles can have any shape, low cost sensors can be used to detect obstacles and an appropriate balance is achieved between the use of the global and the local approaches for collision avoidance. Our present work is a refinement of this strategy that allows for an automatic real time adaptation of the algorithm's parameters. Now, the algorithm's functioning requires only that the minimum distance at which the AGV can approach an obstacle (i.e. the closest it can get to any obstacle) is defined a priori. Aspects of the real implementation of the algorithm are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "In robot motion planning, many algorithms have been proposed that create a path for a robot in an environment with obstacles. Since it can be hard to create such paths, most algorithms are aimed at finding a solution. However, for most applications the paths must be of a good quality as well. That is, paths should preferably be short, be smooth, and should preserve some clearance from the obstacles. In this paper, we focus on improving the clearance of paths. Existing methods only extract high clearance paths for rigid, translating bodies. We present an algorithm that improves the clearance along paths of a broader range of robots which may reside in arbitrary high-dimensional configuration spaces. Examples include planar, free-flying and articulated robots.",

A door and doorway can be parameterized with five parameters. A divide and conquer implementation of the Hough transform is used to segment outlines from range scans. The client software remote controls the wheelchair from the MATLAB environment. The software consists of several Java threads that run concurrently. Sensor data are polled by threads and put into databases to reduce the network lag. The databases are used by a controller and a Kalman filter. Since most of the implementation is coded in Java it is possible to run it as a stand alone program on a computer that has Java installed. From 10 runs the trajectory offset was calculated to 0.9 cm with a standard deviation of 1.4 cm. The standard deviation of the heading was 2.2 degrees. This performance is essentially independent of the initial starting pose.",

        "abstract": "The hybrid free-space optics/radio frequency (FSO/RF) network paradigm promises new levels of throughput for sensor and mobile ad-hoc networks. However, several challenges must be addressed before such a network model can be realized. These include a means by which deployed robots can autonomously establish optical links over sufficiently long distances as well as the formulation of a mobile network architecture that can exploit high throughput FSO channels. In this paper, we offer solutions to these problems in the form of hierarchical link acquisition and routing protocols. The heart of our link acquisition system (LAS) is a vision-based alignment phase for locating robot link partners via high zoom camera systems. Identification is accomplished in real-time using a multi-resolution image representation and normalized intensity distribution (NID) as a similarity metric. Our routing protocol relies upon the hierarchical state routing (HSR) model adapted to the FSO/RF paradigm. Experimental results from a large set of link acquisition trials as well as a small scale FSO/RF deployment are provided to support our approach.",

        "abstract": "Torque sensors in robotics are used in those applications where high precision positioning of the end effector is required. Technological difficulties often arise in the mechanical design as well as in the placement of the sensor. However, the use itself of the torque sensor for feedback control, in all those cases where elasticity of the transmission is an issue, is maybe not completely understood. The main goal of this paper is to put the control problem in a clear and correct setting, both from the steady state and from the dynamic standpoints. The role of the zero in the origin of the complex plane in the transfer function from motor torque to output torque is thoroughly discussed. It is also shown, through analysis and simulations on a detailed model of the space robotic manipulator DEXARM, that a correct design of the torque loop allows to overcome some performance limitations in the control of the load position, that arise in the case of simple positional control.",

        "abstract": "A class of biped locomotion called passive dynamic walking (PDW) has been recognized to be efficient in energy consumption and a key to understand human walking. Although PDW is sensitive to the initial condition and disturbances, some studies of quasi-PDW, which introduces supplementary actuators, are reported to overcome the sensitivity. In this article, for realization of the quasi-PDW, an on-line learning scheme of a feedback controller based on a policy gradient reinforcement learning method is proposed. Computer simulations show that the parameter in a quasi-PDW controller is automatically tuned by our method utilizing the passivity of the robot dynamics. The obtained controller is robust against variations in the slope gradient to some extent.",

On-tree situations of contrasting red and green apples as well as green apples in the orchard with poor contrast have been considered. The study found out that the redness in both cases of red and green apples can be used to differentiate apples from the rest of the orchard. Texture based edge detection has been combined with redness measures, and area thresholding followed by circle fitting, to determine the location of apples in the image plane. In the case of severely cluttered environments, Laplacian filters have been used to further clutter the foliage arrays by edge enhancement so that texture differences between the foliage and the apples increased thereby facilitating the separation of apples from the foliage. Results are presented that show the recognition of red and green apples in a number of situations as well as apples that are clustered together and/or occluded.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new solution for solving the grasping force optimization problem, fundamental in dexterous manipulation by multifingered robotic hands. Several methods have been proposed in the literature, yielding optimal solutions, with either recursive or non linear programming techniques. However, most of them involve many computations and cannot be used online. Furthermore, they do not offer a smooth solution regarding to possible changes in the contact conditions due to finger rolling or gaiting, or in the desired resultant force to be exerted on the grasped object. The more recent ones are fast and smooth enough for real-time computation but the method we present here is faster, easier to implement and provide very satisfying results, even though the solution is sub-optimal. The method is based on the minimization of a cost function that gives an analytical solution but does not ensure by itself the satisfaction of the static frictional constraints. An associated iterative adjustment modifies this function until the internal forces enter the friction cone. The minimal solution is found within a few iterations. Force determination is therefore included in the simulation of a hybrid position/force controller to prove the effectiveness of such an approach for updating the force references during the grasped object motion.",

This method considers the operations of JSSP as the autonomous decentralized system elements. According to the definition of the local potential functions between two operations (two operations on the same machine or the same job), the original schedule can be revised to accommodate with the disturbances of manufacturing, such as machine breakdown, processing time variation, in a short time. The present method is tested for benchmark problems with disturbances.",

The algorithm has following characteristics: 1) The algorithm incorporates human knowledge about relation between action names in order to simplify and toughen the algorithm, thus our algorithm can label robustly multiple action names at the same time. 2) The algorithm uses time-series action probability that represents the likelihood of each action occurrence at every frame time. 3) The classification technique with hidden Markov models (HMMs) enables the algorithm to detect robustly and immediately the segmental points. The experimental results using real motion capture data show that our algorithm not only decreases effectively the latency for detecting the segmental points but also prevents the system from making unnecessary segments due to the error of time-series action probability.",

Several objectives of human-network interaction are identified. The main focus of this work is on human-to-network information flow, i.e. human operators are regarded as information sources. It is argued that operators should make raw observations which are converted into the sensor network's common representation by a probabilistic model. The concepts are discussed in the context of an outdoor sensor network under development. Human operators contribute geometric feature information in the form of range and bearing observations. Visual feature properties are specified via meaningful class labels. A sensor model, represented as a Bayesian network, translates label observations into the system's representation. The model is also used to classify features as observed by robotic sensors.",

        "abstract": "Atomic force microscope (AFM) based nanomanipulation has been extensively investigated for many years. However, the efficiency and accuracy of the AFM based nanomanipulation is still a major issue due to the nonlinearities and uncertainties in nanomanipulation operations. The deformation of the cantilever caused by manipulation force, in our experience, is one of the most major nonlinearities and uncertainties. It causes difficulties in precisely controlling the tip position, which will cause the tip to miss the position of the object. In order to solve this problem, the traditional approach is to use a rigid cantilever. However, this will significantly reduce the sensitivity of the force feeling during the manipulation, which is essential for achieving an efficient and reliable nanomanipulation. An active AFM probe is used to solve this problem by directly controlling the cantilever's flexibility or rigidity during manipulation. An infinite dimensional model of the active probe is developed. Control of the active probe employing an optimal LQR control law is also implemented. The experimental results have verified the theoretical model and demonstrated that the precise position control and high sensitive interaction force measurement can be achieved simultaneously.",

        "abstract": "Kinematic design of parallel manipulators is addressed in this paper. By observation that regular (e.g., hyper-rectangular) workspaces are desirable for most machines, we propose the concept of effective regular workspace, which reflects both requirements on the workspace shape and quality. Dexterity index is utilized to characterize the effectiveness of the workspace. The optimal design problem is then formulated to find a manipulator geometry that maximizes the effective regular workspace. Since the optimal design problem is a constrained nonlinear optimization problem without explicit analytical expressions, the controlled random search (CRS) technique, which was reported robust and reliable, is applied to numerically solve the problem. The commonly-used Stewart-Gough platform is employed as an example to demonstrate the design procedure.",

The proposed technique makes use of the probability distribution of the target(s) in the environment, thereby making it feasible to incorporate any additional information, known a-priori or acquired while the search is taking place, into the search strategy. The environment is divided into a set of distinct regions and an adjacency matrix is used to describe the connections between them. The costs of searching any of the regions as well as the cost of travel between them can be arbitrarily specified. The search strategy is derived using a dynamic programming algorithm. The effectiveness of the algorithm is illustrated using an example based on the search of an office environment. An analysis of the computational complexity is also presented.",

Usual implementations use a standard narrow field of view (FOV) camera and a communications link, and a head mounted display (HMD). Teleoperating a robotic vehicle or surveying a scene with such system and a computer monitor is difficult for human operators due to the narrow FOV of standard cameras, the unintuitive interface for directing the camera, and the loss of directional sense. For this reason these systems often use a head mounted display (HMD) instead of a monitor, however this introduces the HMD pose latency problem of latency and slow update due to the mechanical motion of the camera and the communications link. Even with good equipment, the experience is disorienting and slow. This paper proposes a pano-presence architecture for telepresence for applications such as teleoperation based on panoramic cameras, a communications link, and an HMD. The panoramic camera, capable of capturing light from all azimuth directions, provides a panorama which is be transported over the communications link to a panorama frame buffer for viewing in the HMD screen(s). The panorama viewing rate is decoupled from the communications latency so the user can look around freely without experiencing HMD pose latency problem, the delay in the HMD's image alignment with the head position. A panorama frame format of an image cube is chosen since it can be viewed at full frame rate with the acceleration in consumer graphics cards. Two prototype systems, one telepresence and one teleoperation, using this architecture are described.",

This paper shows that its architecture is particularly well adapted to high dynamics. Indeed, it is an evolution of Delta, H4 and 14 robots architectures: it keeps the advantages of these existing robots, while overcoming their drawbacks. In addition, an optimization method based on velocity using adept motion has been developed and applied to this high speed parallel robot. All these considerations led to experimentations that proved we can reach high accelerations (13 G) and obtain a cycle time of 0.28 s.",

In order to solve our optimization problem an evolutionary based technique is implemented.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper deals with the class of robotic assemblies where position uncertainty far exceeds assembly clearance, and visual assistance is not available to resolve the uncertainty. Under this scenario, we can implement a localization strategy that resolves the uncertainty using a pre-acquired map of all possible peg-hole contact configurations. Prior to assembly, the strategy explores the contact configuration space (C-space) by sequentially bringing the peg (under different configurations) into contact with the stationary (fixtured) hole and matching the contact configurations thus recorded with the map. The different peg configurations can be actively chosen to maximize uncertainty-reduction. However, with a sampled map of the contact C-space, discretization errors are introduced, and implementing deterministic matching (at the fine-grained level necessary for assembly) would soon become prohibitively expensive in terms of computation. Additionally, with global initial uncertainty, multiple solutions abound in our localization problem. In this paper, we introduce a particle filter implementation which can not only handle the discretization errors in map-matching, but also track multiple solutions simultaneously. The particle filter implementation was validated on computer simulations of round and square peg-in-hole assemblies, before testing it on corresponding actual robotic assemblies. The implementation was highly successful on both the assemblies, reducing the uncertainty by more than 95 % and making it easy for a previously-devised compliant strategy to achieve assembly. Results from the simulations and actual assemblies are reported. We also present a comparison of these results (using random localization: peg moves selected randomly) with preliminary results from assemblies using active localization.",

We present an exact algorithm that, given a path for the object consisting of k sections, preprocesses the environment consisting of n non-intersecting line segments in O(n/sup 2/ log n) and reports a push path in O(kn log n) time or reports failure if no path exists. Under the weak assumption of low obstacle density, the query time is reduced to O((k + n) log n).",

The first approach is adapted from an existing randomized gradient descent (RGD) method for closed-chain robots. The second approach is radically different. We call it ATACE alternate task-space and configuration-space exploration. Unlike the first approach which searches purely in C-space, ATACE works in both task space and C-space. It explores the task space for end-effector paths satisfying given constraints, and utilizes trajectory tracking technique(s) as a local planner(s) to track these paths in the configuration space. We have implemented both approaches and compare their relative performances in different scenarios. ATACE outperforms RGD in majority (but not all) of the scenarios. We outline intuitive explanations for the relative performances of these two approaches.",

        "abstract": "The idea of stochastic evolutionary neuron migration process (SENMP) is to use artificial evolution process to arrange spatially interacting computational entities, i.e. artificial neurons, into a pattern in 2-space so that desired behavior or dynamics emerges within the pattern. In this paper, we analyze the role of space in regard to SENMP performance using the well known double pole balancing problem as a test case. We also study the effect of environmental change to the adaptation process during a robot navigation experiment. This analysis suggests that synaptic scaling like dynamics, resembling inverted Hebbian rule, can emerge in the stochastic pattern formation process between the laterally interacting computational entities.",

Using cameras, projectors, and self-moving trays, the system supports human from both physical and informational aspects. This paper deals with the problem for estimating the object that a user needs. We present one of the approaches for accurate estimation of a necessary object from the user's pointing gesture. The system arranges the self-moving trays by itself based on the user's past action sequences. Using force-directed method, good placement, which decrease false estimations and is not moved very much from the initial placement, can be obtained. A description of the experimental results demonstrates the usefulness of the method proposed here.",

Although the problem domain is stochastic in nature, our algorithm takes advantage of deterministic path-planning techniques to achieve significant performance improvements.",

We have employed a single laser beam as optical tweezers for separating a target cell and locating it adjacent to a fabricated transparent micro heater. Simultaneously, the target cell is immobilized or partially entrapped with thermo sensitive hydro gel by heating up the micro heater. The state of the thermo sensitive hydro gel can be switched from sol to gel and gel to sol reversibly by controlling its temperature through heating up and cooling down the micro heater. Having got rid of the other unwanted cells by the high speed cleaning flow in microchannel, the entrapped cell will be isolated effectively. It is possible to collect the immobilized target cell after analysis or culture process by switching of the micro heater and releasing the cell from the entrapment. We have demonstrated that the proposed approach is feasible for rapid manipulation, immobilization, cleaning, isolation and extraction of a single cell. Experiment results are shown here.",

Two CCD cameras are placed toward the wire on a horizontal plane, and obtain the images of the moving wire respectively. Through the simultaneously obtained two wire images, the angles between the wire and a vertical line are calculated. By feedback control using wire angles measured by the developed sensor, a mass suspended by a two dimensional crane on a horizontal plane is positioned without residual vibration at a target point. Since the developed sensor system is placed near the upper end of the wire regardless of wire length, it is easy to install the developed system in conventional cranes. By using this sensor system, it is expected to automate heavy object positioning, handling and so on.",

Those signals are emitted by the muscles attached to the adjoining bones during their activation. With the resulting intended motion, a leg orthosis can be controlled in realtime to support disabled people while walking or climbing stairs and help patients suffering from the effects of a stroke in their rehabilitation efforts. To allow a variety of different motions, a human body model with physical properties is developed and synchronized with data recorded from the pose sensors. Computing the intended motion is performed by converting calibrated EMG signals to muscle forces which animate the model. The algorithm was evaluated with experiments showing the calculated intended motion while climbing one step of a stair. The algorithm and the experimental results are both shown.",

Many algorithms for resource management in sensor networks require complete knowledge of the external environment and the sensor network system, are rule-based and cannot handle rapidly changing environments; this restricts their use in real-world environments. We present an event based control optimization formulation of the resource management problem and discuss a method to adaptively change desired system performance of the sensor network in response to events. This functionality is critical in field-deployable sensor networks where the available energy is extremely limited. This limitation disallows continuous operation as a very expensive option and necessitates system adaptation as a means to extend operational lifetime in the face of dynamic external events. We show results on synthetic sensor networks where only partially accurate information about the external world and the sensing system is available and illustrate the efficacy of the control algorithm in handling dynamic events with guaranteed minimum system lifespan via efficient usage of energy resources. We show that the control algorithm makes effective control decisions about the use of energy resources with varying sensor reliabilities.",

It is being made possible by the quick advance in the technologies of Internet, shared virtual environments and robotics. Due to the heterogeneity of the Internet, operators participating in the collaboration from geographically distributed locations might receive feedback from the working site with different time delays, leading to various views of the scene. This asynchronization will make the collaboration difficult and compromise system efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism to achieve both inter-client and intra-client synchronization in collaborative teleoperation systems. Our approach uses an initial synchronization procedure, buffer management and feedback messages to synchronize data streams sent to geographically distributed operators. The delay bounds of the network do not necessarily need to be known and we use the time stamp in the initial and feedback messages for this purpose.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we address the problem of motion planning for multiple robots. We introduce a prioritized method, based on a powerful method for motion planning in dynamic environments, recently developed by the authors. Our approach is generically applicable: there is no limitation on the number of degrees of freedom of each of the robots, and robots of various types - for instance free-flying robots and articulated robots - can be used simultaneously. Results show that high-quality paths can be produced in less than a second of computation time, even in confined environments involving many robots. We examine three issues in particular in this paper: the assignment of priorities to the robots, the performance of prioritized planning versus coordinated planning, and the influence of the extent by which the robot motions are constrained on the performance of the method. Results are reported in terms of both running time and the quality of the paths produced.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a probabilistic scan matching algorithm to estimate the robot planar displacement by matching dense two-dimensional range scans. The general framework follows an iterative process of two steps: (i) computation of correspondences between scans, and (ii) estimation of the relative displacement. The contribution is a probabilistic modelling of this process that takes into account all the uncertainties involved: the uncertainty of the displacement of the sensor and the measurement noises. Furthermore, it also considers all the possible correspondences resulting from these uncertainties. This technique has been implemented and tested on a real vehicle. The experiments illustrate how the performances of this method are better than previous geometric ones in terms of robustness, accuracy and convergence.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a robotic implementation of the theory of graph grammars (Klavins et al., 2005), which we use to model and direct self-organization in a formal, predictable and provably-correct fashion. The robots, which we call programmable parts, float passively on an air table and bind to each other upon random collisions. Once attached, they execute local rules that determine how their internal states change and whether they should remain bound. We demonstrate through experiments how they can self-organize into a global structure by executing a common graph grammar in a completely distributed fashion. The system also presents a challenge to the grammatical method (and to distributed systems approaches in general) due to the stochastic nature of its dynamics. We conclude by discussing these challenges and our initial approach to addressing them.",

        "abstract": "Division of labor performed by social insects, such as ants and bees, is one of the most advanced functions that they have evolved. Although individual insects have the same inheritance, they are divided into certain groups in which they play specialized roles. For effective performance, the groups exhibit proportional regulation of population, which implies regulating their population to maintain their proportion; further the proportion of each group is regulated against external disturbances without aid from a special individual. In a multi-robot system, the division of labor is one of the most attractive and useful propositions. This paper addresses the proportion regulation of population in a homogenous multi-robot system, which is inspired by the task allocation practiced by social insects. We propose an extended probability model for proportion regulation, and confirm its performance by numerical simulation. We also experimentally validate its performance using a simple multi-robot system.",

Since MEXI often communicates with well known persons but also with unknown humans, for instance at exhibitions, we realized a speaker dependent mode as well as a speaker independent mode in our prosody based emotion recognition. A key point of our approach is that it automatically selects the most significant features from a set of twenty analyzed features based on a training database of speech samples. This is important according to our results, since the set of significant features differs considerably between the distinguished emotions. With our approach we reach average recognition rates of 84% in speaker dependent mode and 60% in speaker independent mode.",

We focus on two support polygons which consist of the both hands and one foot, and we make them include the center of mass (CoM). In this case, the humanoid robot doesn't need to move the CoM for walking and it is easily possible to make stable gate motion. The force control considering the pushing force and the acceleration control of the CoM are implemented for the gate velocity control. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Overlay networks have been proposed to improve the QoS of teleoperation applications. However efficient use the overlay network resources and the distribution of these resources optimally to all supermedia streams remains an important problem.

They are invariant depending on the image transformations caused by the movements of the robot. Several methods have been suggested to construct such invariants but they often rely on hypotheses about the transformation group which do not hold any more when dealing with omnidirectional sensors. These sensors benefit from an increasing interest in mobile robotics because of their field of view but they require adaptations of classical methods. This paper presents a method based on group averaging to construct invariant features which could be used to recognize a place with this type of sensors.",

For the aim of human-robot interface, CBIR on the robot image database would be very useful, to train the robot to learn features (e.g. color, texture) of the relevant objects (e.g. book, chair) that a human user is interested in. To achieve CBIR, a small but sufficient member of relevant objects' features are required. We will propose a novel CBIR method that efficiently searches such relevant objects based not only on their features, but also on their locations with respect to the robot's workspace. To combine both of the feature and the location information, a novel 2D occupancy map called query based occupancy map (QOM) is presented.",

        "abstract": "The humanoid bipedal locomotion requires computationally efficient solutions of the navigation and inverse kinematics problems. This paper presents analytic methods, using tools from computational geometry and techniques from the theory of Lie groups, to develop new geometric algorithms for the navigation path planning, locomotion movement, and kinematics modeling of humanoid robots. To solve the global navigation problem, we introduce the new fast marching method modified (FM3) algorithm, based on the fast marching methods (FMM) used to study interface motion, that gives a close-form solution for the humanoid collision-free whole body trajectory (WBT) calculation. For the bipedal locomotion, we build the new geometric algorithm one step to goal (OSG), to produce a general solution for the body and footstep planning which make the humanoid to move a single step towards a defined objective. We develop the new approach called sagittal kinematics division (SKD), for the humanoid modeling analysis, to allow us to solve the humanoid inverse kinematics problem using the mathematical techniques of Lie groups, like the product of exponentials (POE). The works are presented along with computed examples of the humanoid robot RHO at the University Carlos III of Madrid. We remark that this paper introduces only closed-form solutions, numerically stable and geometrically meaningful, suitable for real-time applications.",

The developed hovering robot shows stable flying performances under the adoption of RIC (robust internal-loop compensator) based disturbance compensation and the vision based localization method. Although a model is incorrect, RIC method can design a controller by regarding the inaccurate part of the model and sensor noises as disturbances. The UAV can also avoid obstacles using eight IRs (infrareds) and four ultrasonic range sensors.

However, it is difficult to direct the goal or sub-goal positions to multiple robots for the sake of cooperation with each other. Planning algorithms reduce the burden for this purpose. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent planning algorithm based on a random sampling method. This method doesn't require the exact sub-goal positions nor the times at which cooperation occurs. The effectiveness of this approach is empirically shown by simulation results.",

        "abstract": "We present two key parts of an ongoing robotic, vision-based architectural modeling project. The first component is a randomized approach to view planning for a single ground robot scanning a building perimeter to recover a series of texture map mosaics. This algorithm generates paths that simultaneously address coverage and quality (i.e., real-valued distance and foreshortening factors). The second part is a technique for \"cleaning\" the captured texture maps in the presence of occlusions caused by trees, signs, people, and other foreground objects. When such occlusions comprise a minority of views a background feature can be recovered via temporal median filtering, but when they are in the majority, appearance information from other visible portions of the facade provides a critical cue to correctly complete the mosaic. We describe a novel spatiotemporal timeline-based inpainting algorithm that identifies and corrects such areas.",

In traditional oscillator theories to rhythmic movement generation, synchronization with another signal is relatively slow, and it is not easy to achieve accurate phase locking with a particular feature of the driving stimulus. Using a recently developed framework of dynamic motor primitives, we demonstrate a novel algorithm for very rapid synchronization of a rhythmic movement pattern, which can phase lock any feature of the movement to any particular event in the driving stimulus. As an example application, we demonstrate how an anthropomorphic robot can use imitation learning to acquire a complex drumming pattern and keep it synchronized with an external rhythm generator that changes its frequency over time.",

The parameters of this transformation are estimated using a non-linear minimization of a unique criterion that integrates information both on the texture and the edges of the tracked object. The proposed tracker is then more robust and succeeds in conditions where methods based on a single cue fail.

        "abstract": "A novel method based on deformable length of elastic element control (DLEEC) to realize the stiffness display for perception of virtual soft object is proposed, and the stiffness display interface device has been developed and is presented. The stiffness display interface device is composed of a thin elastic beam and an actuator to adjust the length of the beam. The deformation of the beam under a force is proportional to the third power of the beam length. By controlling the beam length, the stiffness display device can reproduce the stiffness of the virtual object from very soft to hard, so that the human fingertip can feel it as if he directly touches with the virtual object by interacting with the device. A real time position control algorithm is employed to guarantee the real time stiffness display.",

        "abstract": "In home environments, demands for a robot to serve a user are on the increase, such as cleaning rooms, bringing something to the user, and so on. To achieve these tasks, it is essential for developing a natural way of human-robot interaction (HRI). One of the most natural ways is that the robot approaches the user to do some tasks after recognizing the user's call and localizing its position. In this case, user localization becomes a key technology. In this paper, we propose a novel audio visual user localization system. It consists of a microphone array with eight sensors and a video camera. Estimating calling direction is achieved by the spectral subtraction of the spatial spectra. In particular, a novel beam forming method is proposed to suppress the nonstationary audio noises where they always occur in a real world. Furthermore, a robust method for face detection is proposed to double check the user based on an Adaboost classifier. It is improved to reduce the false alarms remarkably through a new postprocessing on face candidates. Successful results in a real home environment show its efficacy and feasibility. The implementation issues, limitations, and their possible solutions are also discussed.",

This work constitutes a first step towards our goal of implementing a mechanism of human-machine interaction that allows a robot to provide feedback to a teacher in an imitation learning framework. In particular, we have developed a computer-vision based, upper-body motion analysis system that works without special devices or markers. Since such system is unstable and can only acquire partial information because of self-occlusions and depth ambiguity, we have employed a model-based pose estimation method based on inverse kinematics. The resulting system can estimate upper-body human postures with limited perceptual cues, such as centroid coordinates and disparity of head and hands.",

The mechanical structure, chosen by end-users' specifications, presents a self-motion singularity within the working space of the medical expert. A strategy has been developed to counter the effect of the singularity located in the centre of the working space based on an real-time singularity control of the robotic tele-operated system. Thanks to the implementation of this real-time control, several clinical tele-echography tests have been successfully performed where medical specialists were able to propose a diagnosis in 80% of the studied cases.",

When faced with streaming video from a lower-quality, rapidly moving camera and limited computational resources, the challenge increases. We present our implementation of a vision system on a mobile robot platform that uses a camera image as the primary sensory input. Having to perform all processing, including segmentation and object detection, in real-time on-board the robot, eliminates the possibility of using some state-of-the-art methods that otherwise might apply. We describe the methods that we developed to achieve a practical vision system within these constraints. Our approach is fully implemented and tested on a team of Sony AIBO robots.",

For researchers interested in autonomous robot teams operating in highly dynamic environments performing complex tasks, such as robot soccer, fast color-based object recognition is very desirable. Indeed, there are a number of existing algorithms that have been developed within the community to achieve this goal. Many of these algorithms, however, do not adapt for variation in lighting intensity, thereby limiting their use to statically and uniformly lit indoor environments. In this paper, we present a new technique for color object recognition that can adapt to changes in illumination but remains computationally efficient. We present empirical results demonstrating the performance of our technique for both indoor and outdoor environments on a robot platform performing tasks drawn from the robot soccer domain. Additionally, we compare the computational speed of our new approach against CMVision, a fast open-source color segmentation library. Our performance results show that our technique is able to adapt to lighting variations without requiring significant additional CPU resources.",

        "abstract": "Object recognition is one of the major research topics in the field of computer vision. In robotics, there is often a need for a system that can locate certain objects in the environment - the capability which we denote as 'object detection'. In this paper, we present a new method for object detection. The method is especially suitable for detecting objects in natural scenes, as it is able to cope with problems such as complex background, varying illumination and object occlusion. The proposed method uses the receptive field representation where each pixel in the image is represented by a combination of its color and response to different filters. Thus, the cooccurrence of certain filter responses within a specific radius in the image serves as information basis for building the representation of the object. The specific goal in this paper is the development of an online learning scheme that is effective after just one training example but still has the ability to improve its performance with more time and new examples. We describe the details behind the algorithm and demonstrate its strength with an extensive experimental evaluation.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a recognition-based autonomous navigation system for mobile robots. The system is based on our previously proposed robust invariant feature (RIF) detector. This detector extracts highly robust and repeatable features based on the key idea of tracking multi-scale interest points and selecting unique representative local structures with the strongest response in both spatial and scale domains. Weighted Zernike moments are used as the feature descriptor and applied to the place recognition. The navigation system is composed of on-line and off-line two stages. In the off-line learning stage, we train the robot in its workspace by just taking several images of representative places as landmarks. Then, in the on-line navigation stage, the robot recognizes scenes, obtains robust feature correspondences, and navigates the environment autonomously using the iterative pose converging (IPC) algorithm which is based on the idea of the visual servoing technique. The experimental results and the performance evaluation show that the proposed navigation system can achieve excellent performance in complex indoor environments.",

        "abstract": "This paper extends and improves upon our previous work on the use of stereotypical aggressive display behavior to reduce interference in robot teams, and thus improve their overall efficiency. We examine a team of robots with no centralized control performing a transportation task in which robots frequently interfere with each other. The robots must work in the same space, so territorial methods are not appropriate. In our method, when robots come into competition for floor space, each selects an aggression level and the competition is resolved in favor of the more aggressive robot. Our recent work showed that choosing aggression proportional to task investment can produce better overall system performance compared to aggression chosen at random. This paper describes a new technique, local investment, for computing an aggression level that performs better than any previous method and relies only on local sensor data. The method is evaluated in a simulation study, and is then shown to be effective in a real-world robot implementation.",

        "abstract": "Mobile robots provide new opportunities for research in environment sensing. By combining sensors and robots, we can develop applications to enhance security, search and rescue, and detect hazardous materials. One important problem is to use fewer mobile sensors to cover an area. This paper focuses on two problems in robot sensor deployment: speed management and detouring distance under energy and timing constraints. We determine the robots' traveling speed based on the remaining energy and remaining time before deadline. We use probabilistic models for environments with obstacles and propose an empirical analysis to estimate the extra traveling distance due to detouring. We compute the number of robots (fleet size) needed for cover an area and our approach reduces the fleet size. Compared with two simple heuristics, our method uses 21% fewer robots.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the hypothesis that robots based on highly coupled mechanical structures can give rise to redundancy in control. Highly coupled mechanical structures have the property that actuation at one location can translate into movement at multiple locations, and conversely, movement at one location can be caused by multiple actuators. Due to this property, multiple control strategies may exist for a single behavior. Tensegrity structures which have recently been shown to form the basis for successful locomotor robots (Paul et al., 2005), have highly coupled mechanical structures. Thus, as a case study, it was of interest to investigate whether these new tensegrity based robots could offer a high degree of redundancy of control. This was investigated on two robots, based on three and four strut tensegrity prisms. Control strategies for locomotion were evolved using a genetic algorithm in simulation, and the evolved behaviors were compared. It was found that multiple control strategies existed for forward locomotion in both structures, and that qualitatively similar behavior could be obtained with significantly different control strategies. This indicated that a considerable degree of redundancy could exist in the control of robots based on highly coupled mechanical structures.",

One of the thorny problems in outdoor surveillance by a camera is that adherent noises such as waterdrops on the protecting glass surface lens disturb the view from the camera. Therefore, we propose a method for removing adherent noises from stereo images taken with a stereo camera system. Our method is based on the stereo measurement and utilizes disparities between stereo image pair. Positions of noises in images can be detected by comparing disparities measured from stereo images with the distance between the stereo camera system and the glass surface. True disparities of image regions hidden by noises can be estimated from the property that disparities are generally similar with those around noises. Finally, we can remove noises from images by replacing the above regions with textures of corresponding image regions obtained by the disparity referring.

The object of this application is to evaluate the level of integration between high-speed robotic systems and vision systems in unknown and dynamic environments. The parallel robot is based on a DELTA robot. The optimization method uses a global condition index based on the condition number of the Jacobian matrix. Firstly, we present the geometric model and kinematic analysis of the parallel robot. The optimization defines the dimensions of the manipulator. Using ADAMS/spl reg/, we obtain the maximum speed of the end-effector and the maximum torque of the motors for a set of typical trajectories of the ball in table tennis. Finally, we display the prototype of the built manipulator.",

Initially, we analyze the trend of the impulses with a simple 3-DOF planar robot arm in various contact positions and present a problem that is in discord with the general trend. To cope with this problem, we propose a new motion generation algorithm considering both the external and internal impulse. The gradient projection method is employed to exploit the kinematic redundancy of robot systems. Initially, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is verified through simulation of a 3-DOF planar robot arm model, and two application examples considering both the external and internal impulses are investigated. Through simulations for the landing of a 4-DOF planar human-body model and the sawing motion by a dual-arm model, it is shown that the posture is stable and the trend of the impulses calculated by the analytical models is coincident to the human experiences.",

        "abstract": "To create a more efficient environment in which to perform remote maintenance, the authors propose a novel collaboration concept, called robot-augmented communication (RAC). In RAC a maintenance robot and an on-site human worker are assisted by another skilled human operator at a remote support center. By emphasizing the intentions of the remote supporter through robot functions that cannot be imitated by humans, RAC can provide effective support for the on-site worker. In the present study, as the first manifestation of RAC, featuring the projection capability of a maintenance robot, a prototype remote-collaboration system named SCOPE (sight collaboration by projection effect) was developed. This system consists of a projector unit with a camera, a multiple control unit (MCU) for video/voice communications, and PCs connected via a network. It has three key functions: creating a shared field of view between a remote supporter and an on-site worker, keeping meta-information related to objects in real space, and projecting meta-information onto the objects. The effectiveness of these functions was evaluated by experiments on two fundamental tasks $\"comprehending a target object\" and \"transmission of instruction details\" nvolved in a typical maintenance operation. The experimental results show that each function is effective in shortening the time taken to perform the maintenance operation.",

Such circumstances demand the application of error separation techniques so that it becomes possible to separate system induced errors from part errors. The proposed system consists of an articulated robotic arm that moves a three-probe scanning device along a workpiece. Sensor readings were recorded at intervals corresponding to the distance between sensors. An algorithm was applied to separate part straightness error and robot arm motion errors. Simulations and experimental tests were carried out to validate the proposed system.",

The over-cost generated by the additive potentialities must be affordable and related to the value of the usual product. In most cases, autonomous functions are direct transpositions of solutions applied in industrial robotics. If we consider that in addition with cost, security is a supplementary constraint of rehabilitation robotics, an important research effort is needed to propose technological components. The aim of this paper is to introduce a functionality within the context of the following plan: \"technical achievement and psychological analysis of a master/slave robot assistance for the invalid person\" (HTSC: human/technology complex system). This application allows a severely handicapped person to handle at the same time a movable platform and a Manus/spl reg/ arm. In this paper, we will present an \"automatic tracking\" functionality we developed in order to keep the Manus/spl reg/ arm automatically close to the patient.",

        "abstract": "The task addressed here requires a swarm of mobile robots to monitor a long corridor, i.e., by sweeping through it while avoiding large obstacles such as buildings. In the case of limited sensors and communication, maintaining spatial coverage - especially after passing the obstacles - is a challenging problem. Note that the main objective of this task is coverage. There are two primary methods for agents to achieve coverage: by uniformly increasing the inter-agent distances, and by moving the swarm as a whole. This paper presents a physics-based solution to the task that is based on a kinetic theory approach; our solution achieves both forms of coverage. Furthermore, the paper describes how we transition from our original algorithm to an algorithm utilizing mostly local sensor information, the latter being more realistic for modeling robots. To determine how well our kinetic theory approach performs against a popular alternative controller, experimental comparisons are presented.",

Consequently, the patient could recover partially some of lower limb functions improving the cardiovascular system, increasing oxygen uptake and bettering the whole quality of life. In this paper, we apply a control design based on a higher order sliding mode to a complex physio-mathematical muscle model. This model is based on macroscopic Hill and microscopic Huxley concepts. The main goal concerns the prediction of the needed pattern stimulation (current and pulse width), which will extend the overall performances and defer the muscle fatigue as much as possible. The controller is mathematically computed and shown to provide satisfactory stability and tracking errors. Its efficiency is illustrated with the control of the knee joint angle under a co-contraction approach.",

In order to do the system independent to the object surface appearance, a structured light emitter is linked to the camera so that 4 laser pointers are projected onto the object. In a previous paper we showed that such a system has good performance and nice characteristics like partial decoupling near the desired state and robustness against misalignment of the emitter and the camera (J. Pages et al., 2004). However, no analytical results concerning the global asymptotic stability of the system were obtained due to the high complexity of the visual features utilized. In this work we present a better set of visual features which improves the properties of the features in (J. Pages et al., 2004) and for which it is possible to prove the global asymptotic stability.",

It remarkably enhances the robustness of localization performance, specifically when large odometric errors are occurred. The perturbation estimator in the combined Kalman filter (CKF) is to estimate systematic errors which perturbs the behavior of nominal state transition equation. Intrinsically, it has the property of integrating the innovation, i.e., the difference between measurement and predicted measurement and thus gives a chance of more reducing the gap between real states and their estimates. After formulation of the CKF recursion, we show how the design parameters can be determined and how much beneficial it is through simulation and experiment for a two-wheeled mobile robot under indoor GPS.",

However, most of them have a difficulty in finding the initial position and size of a face automatically. In this paper, we present a fast and robust method for fully automatic multi-view face detection and tracking. Using a small number of critical rectangle features selected and trained by Adaboost learning algorithm, we can detect the initial position, size and view of a face correctly. Once a face is reliably detected, we can extract face and upper body color distribution from the detected facial regions and upper body regions for building a robust color modeling respectively. Simultaneously, each color modeling is performed by using k-means clustering and multiple Gaussian models. Then, fast and efficient multi-view face tracking is executed by using several critical features and a simple linear Kalman filter. Our proposed algorithm is robust to rotation, partial occlusions, and scale changes in front of dynamic, unstructured background. In addition, our proposed method is computationally efficient. Therefore, it can be executed in real-time.",

        "abstract": "To reach a given goal, a mobile robot first computes a motion plan (i.e. a sequence of actions that takes it to its goal), and then executes it. Markov decision processes (MDPs) have been successfully used to solve these two problems. Their main advantage is that they provide a theoretical framework to deal with the uncertainties related to the robot's motor and perceptive actions during both planning and execution stages. While a previous paper addressed the motion planning stage, this paper deals with execution stage. It describes an approach based on Markov localization and focuses on experimental aspects, in particular, the learning of the transition function (that encodes the uncertainties related to the robot actions) and the sensor model. Experimental results carry out with a real robot demonstrate the robustness of the whole navigation approach.",

Without link velocity measurements, the overall ROC system can achieve a semi-global asymptotical stability result for the position and velocity tracking errors, and position and velocity estimation errors. Experimental results using PUMA 560 indicate that the proposed ROC is able to obtain more accurate and less ripple velocity estimation than that obtained from an observer-controller, hence higher tracking performance can be achieved.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Sonar sensor is an attractive tool for the SLAM of mobile robot because of their economic aspects. This cheap sensor gives relatively accurate range readings if disregarding angular uncertainty and specular reflections. However, these defects make feature detection difficult for the most part of the SLAM. This paper proposes a robust sonar feature detection algorithm. This algorithm gives feature detection methods for both point features and line features. The point feature detection method is based on the TBF (Wijk and Christensen, 2000) scheme. Moreover, three additional processes improve the performance of feature detection as follows; 1) stable intersections; 2) efficient sliding window update; and 3) removal of the false point features on the wall. The line feature detection method is based on the basic property of adjacent sonar sensors. Along the line feature, three adjacent sonar sensors give similar range readings. Using this sensor property, we propose a novel algorithm for line feature detection, which is simple and the feature can be obtained by using only current sensor data. The proposed feature detection algorithm gives a good solution for the SLAM of mobile robots because it gives an accurate feature information for both the point and line features even with sensor errors. Furthermore, a sufficient number of features are available to correct mobile robot pose. Experimental results of the EKF-based SLAM demonstrate the performance of the proposed feature detection algorithm in a home-like environment.",

This method consists of a composite control structure, with a PD controller on the fast dynamics and a PID controller on slow dynamics. Moreover, the need of powerful actuator is removed by decreasing the bandwidth of the fast controller during critical occasions, with the use of a supervisory loop. Fuzzy logic is used in the supervisory law, in order to adjust the proper gain in the forward path. It is then shown that UUB stability of the overall system is guaranteed in presence of uncertainties, provided that the PD and the PID gains are tuned to satisfy certain conditions.",

The presented approach uses the ability of the vision-chip to perform pixel-parallel masking and fast summation-operations on binary images to detect whether the robot and human are too close. After initial evaluation in a (semi)-simulation, the approach was realized in an experimental system. Even with only a small 8-bit microcontroller controlling the vision-chip and the communication, a cycle time of more than 500Hz was achieved.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of motion planning (MP) in dynamic environments. It is first argued that dynamic environments impose a real-time constraint upon MP: it has a limited time only to compute a motion, the time available being a function of the dynamicity of the environment. Now, given the intrinsic complexity of MP, computing a complete motion to the goal within the time available is impossible to achieve in most real situations. Partial motion planning (PMP) is the answer to this problem proposed in this paper. PMP is a motion planning scheme with an anytime flavor: when the time available is over, PMP returns the best partial motion to the goal computed so far. Like reactive navigation scheme, PMP faces a safety issue: what guarantee is there that the system will never end up in a critical situation yielding an inevitable collision? The answer proposed in this paper to this safety issue relies upon the concept of inevitable collision states (ICS). ICS takes into account the dynamics of both the system and the moving obstacles. By computing ICS-free partial motion, the system safety can be guaranteed. Application of PMP to the case of a car-like system in a dynamic environment is presented.",

Its target application is mobile robots operating in remote or hazardous environments where suspension of ongoing missions is unacceptable or human intervention for changing or debugging programs is not easy. The present paper introduces NSU from a point of view of both safety and performance. The present paper defines the safety in NSU as a property that controller programs should not suspend or run away because of update-related sources. Safety issues such as deadlocks, module dependency, discontinuity of behavior between before and after update, and delays due to update overhead time are addressed. Safety and performance of NSU is examined and demonstrated by using three practical mobile systems: a mobile manipulator for a power assist system, a hexapod legged mobile robot, and a biped walking robot with wheeled legs.",

Over the last years several robot middleware platforms have been developed to support the development of robot applications. These platforms rely on two software technologies: software components and distributed middleware. This paper proposes to add a third software technology to robot middleware platforms: scripting technology. Scripting technology improves the ease-of-use of developing robot applications. It makes configuring software components easier and simplifies the integration into one application. Additionally, this paper presents a software architecture called dynamic script generation to cope with more complex applications requirements.",

Given two rigid bodies in contact with each other, the contact kinematics is the mathematical expression of the relative motion between them and the five dimensional contact coordinate vector. Second-order contact kinematics describes the second-order derivative of the contact coordinate vector in terms of the derivative of the relative twist.

In this method, we represent the body of the robot by using elastic elements referred to as \"RoBE (representation of body by elastic elements)\". The self-collision avoidance motion could be realized based on a reaction force generated by the contacts between the elastic elements before the actual self-collision of the robot. In this paper, especially, we consider task constraints and environmental constraints during the self-collision avoidance motion, and propose two priority functions for robots to realize the several kinds of tasks in an environment based on the force/moment applied by a human. By using this control algorithm, we could apply the proposed control algorithm to any robot systems used for human-robot cooperation. The proposed motion control algorithm is implemented in a human-friendly robot, referred to as \"MR Helper\", and experiments are done for illustrating the validity of the proposed self-collision avoidance motion.",

        "abstract": "Biologically inspired reflexive controllers have been implemented on various walking robots. However, due to the natural instability of biped walking, up to date, there has not existed a biped robot that depends exclusively on reflexive controllers for its dynamically stable walking control. In this paper, we present our design and experiments of a planar biped robot under control of a pure reflexive controller that includes only local extensor and flexor reflexes (no any other reflexes for explicit stability control). The reflexive controller is built with biologically inspired stretch receptors and model neurons. It requires fewer phasic feedbacks than those reflexive controllers of multilegged robots, and does not employ any kind of position or velocity control algorithm even on its low level. Instead, the approximate property of this reflexive controller has allowed our biped robot to substantially exploit its own passive dynamics in some stages of its walking gait cycle. Due to the interaction of the reflexive controller and the properly designed mechanics of the robot, the biped robot works as a closely coupled neuromechanical system, and demonstrates self-stabilizing property in the experiments of slightly perturbed walking, shallow slope walking, and various speed walking. Moreover, our biped robot can walk stably at a relatively high speed (nearly three leg-lengths per second). We know of no other biped robots that could attain such a high relative speed.",

Second, an integrated system comprised of a restriction system for rotational angle and boom-luffing angle, as well as an obstacle avoidance system was built.

        "abstract": "To develop a new three-axis tactile sensor for mounting on multi-fingered robotic hands, in this work we optimize sensing elements on the basis of our previous works concerning optical three-axis tactile sensors with a flat sensing surface. The present tactile sensor is based on the principle of an optical waveguide-type tactile sensor, which is composed of an acrylic hemispherical dome, a light source, an array of rubber sensing elements, and a CCD camera. The sensing element of the present tactile sensor comprises one columnar feeler and eight conical feelers. The contact areas of the conical feelers, which maintain contact with the acrylic dome, detect the three-axis force applied to the tip of the sensing element. Normal and shearing forces are then calculated from integration and centroid displacement of the gray-scale value derived from the conical feeler's contacts. To evaluate the present tactile sensor, we have conducted a series of experiments using a y-z stage, a rotational stage and a force gauge, and have found that although the relationship between integrated gray-scale value and normal force depends on the latitude on the hemispherical surface, it is easy to modify the sensitivity according to the latitude, and that the centroid displacement of the gray-scale value is proportional to the shearing force. Finally, to verify the present tactile sensor, we performed a series of scanning tests using a robotic manipulator equipped with the present tactile sensor to have the manipulator scan surfaces of fine abrasive papers. Results show that the obtained shearing force increased with an increase in the particle diameter of aluminium dioxide contained in the abrasive paper, and decreased with an increase in the scanning velocity of the manipulator over the abrasive paper. Because these results are consistent with tribology, we conclude that the present tactile sensor has sufficient dynamic sensing capability to detect normal and shearing forces. Show More",

Our system consists of two subsystems: a lower and a higher layer. The lower layer uses a particle filter to evaluate the posterior probability of the localization. When the particles converge into clusters, the higher layer starts particle clustering and sensor planning to generate an optimal sensing action sequence for the localization. The higher layer uses a Bayesian network for the probabilistic inference. The sensor planning takes into account both localization belief and sensing cost. We conducted simulations and actual robot experiments to validate our proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with sensor-based motion planning method for a robot arm manipulator operating among unknown obstacles of arbitrary shape. It can be applied to online collision avoidance with no prior knowledge of the obstacles. The sensitive skin is used to build a description of the robot's surroundings. This approach is based on the configuration space but the construction of the C-obstacle surface is avoided. The point automation is confined on some planes with square grids in the C-space. A path searching algorithm based on the square grids is used to guide the automation maneuvering around the C-obstacles on the selected planes. To avoid the construction of the C-obstacle surface, the robot geometry model is expanded, and the static collision detection method is used. Hence, the computation time is reduced and the algorithm can work in real time. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a series of simulations.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study the sensory motor control mechanism in human reaching movements by considering the redundant muscle dynamics. We first formulate the kinematics and dynamics of a two-link arm model with six muscles, and introduce the nonlinear muscle dynamics based on the biological understanding. Secondly, we show the stability of the system by using intrinsic muscle characteristics and La Salle's invariance theorem. From this result and the numerical simulations, we propose that the reaching movement can be regulated by the internal forces of the redundant muscles, in detail the muscle's internal forces can be used to control the damping of the joints. In addition, human can compensate the gravity by using antigravity muscles. To realize this effect in the arm, we propose the gravity compensation method at the muscle input level from the viewpoint of robotics. We present the result of numerical simulation to verify the usefulness of this compensation method.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, motivated by the emergence of ubiquitous computing technology, a new class of networked robots - ubiquitous robots - has been introduced. The URC (ubiquitous robotic companion) is our conceptual vision of ubiquitous robot which provides us with the services we need, anytime and anywhere. To realize the vision of URC, it is one of the most important requirements for the robotic systems to support seamlessness of services even though service environments changes. Specifically, it is needed for robotic systems to be interoperable with the sensors and devices in current service environments automatically, rather than statically preprogrammed for them. In this paper, we present SURF (service-oriented ubiquitous robotic framework) which enables automated integration of networked robots into ubiquitous computing environments based on the semantic Web services technology. In SURF approach, we implement interfaces for robots, networked sensors and devices as Web services. And we describe knowledge about them in OWL-S the semantic Web services ontology and register the knowledge to KB, so that a SURF agent can automatically discover required knowledge and compose a feasible service plan for the service environments. And then the agent controls robots, sensors and devices through SOAP the Web services execution protocol according to the service plan.",

A typical example is the case of RoboCup competitions because other agent behaviors may cause sudden changes in state transition probabilities in which constancy is needed for the learning to converge. The keys for simultaneous learning to acquire competitive behaviors in such an environment are: a modular learning system for adaptation to the policy alternation of others; and an introduction of macro actions for simultaneous learning to reduce the search space. This paper presents a method of modular learning in a multiagent environment in which the learning agents can simultaneously learn their behaviors and adapt themselves to the situations as a consequence of the others' behaviors.",

The mobile robots are equipped with either global positioning systems (GPS) or other localization devices. By moving the mobile robots and broadcasting their locations in the sensor network, the static sensors are able to estimate their position based on the messages received. A mobile robot navigation in a un-localized sensor network is further developed. As and when an event occurs in the sensor network, a mobile robot can be navigated by the un-localized sensor nodes to the event location, which in turn are finely localized by the mobile robot. The mobile robot, equipped with advanced sensing and communication capabilities, can enhance the sensing in the area of event location. This algorithm works well in an event driven network wherein both the localization of the sensor nodes and navigation of the mobile robot to the event is done simultaneously. As the frequency of the event increases the nodes are better localized and the precision of the node's location becomes finer. Simulation results have been used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",

        "abstract": "A line in space is projected to a conic in a central catadioptric image, and such a conic is called a line image. This paper proposes a novel approach to calibrating catadioptric camera and detecting line images simultaneously by using Hough transform. Previous approaches to catadioptric cameras calibration employ the traditional conic detecting or fitting methods for line images, and then use these recovered conies to estimate the intrinsic parameters based on some properties of line images. However, the type of a line image can be line, circle, ellipse, hyperbola or parabola, and in general only a small arc of the conic is visible in the image, which brings novel challenges for conic detection and fitting where traditional conic detecting and fitting methods may fail. As we know, the accuracy of the estimated intrinsic parameters highly depends on the accuracy of the extracted conies. The main contribution of this work is we show that all line images from catadioptric cameras with the same intrinsic parameters must belong to a family of conies with only two degree-of-freedom, and such a family is called a line image family. Therefore, we present a novel special Hough transform for line image detection which ensures that all detected conies must belong to a line image family related to certain intrinsic parameters. For all possible values of the unknown intrinsic parameters, the line image special Hough transform are performed. The one with the highest confidence is chosen as the estimated values for these unknown intrinsic parameters, and the corresponding results of line image detection are chosen as the estimated values for line images. In order to make the searching process more efficient, the hierarchical approaches are employed in this paper. The validity of our proposed approach is illustrated by experiments.",

        "abstract": "Linear encoders for nanoscale position sensing based on single carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays are presented. Vertically aligned single multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) are realized using a combination of e-beam lithography and plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) growth. Electron beam lithography is used to define 50-150 nm nickel catalyst dots at precise locations on a silicon chip. Precise control of the position, density and alignment of the tubes has been achieved. Aligned nanotube arrays with spacing varying from 250 nm to 25 /spl mu/m are realized. Field emission properties of the array are investigated inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with a 3-DOF nanorobotic manipulator with nanometer resolution functioning as a scanning anode. With this scanning anode and the single MWNT array, a nano encoder is investigated experimentally. Vertical position is detected by the change in emission current, whereas the horizontal position of the scanning anode is sensed from the emission distribution. A resolution of 98.3 nm in the vertical direction and 38.0 nm (best: 12.9 nm) in the lateral direction has been achieved.",

        "abstract": "A system that enables continuous slip compensation for a Mars rover has been designed, implemented, and field-tested. This system is composed of several components that allow the rover to accurately and continuously follow a designated path, compensate for slippage, and reach intended goals in high-slip environments. These components include: visual odometry, vehicle kinematics, a Kalman filter pose estimator, and a slip compensation/path follower. Visual odometry tracks distinctive scene features in stereo imagery to estimate rover motion between successively acquired stereo image pairs. The vehicle kinematics for a rocker-bogie suspension system estimates motion by measuring wheel rates, and rocker, bogie, and steering angles. The Kalman filter merges data from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and visual odometry. This merged estimate is then compared to the kinematic estimate to determine how much slippage has occurred, taking into account estimate uncertainties. If slippage has occurred then a slip vector is calculated by differencing the current Kalman filter estimate from the kinematic estimate. This slip vector is then used to determine the necessary wheel velocities and steering angles to compensate for slip and follow the desired path.",

Although biped humanoid robots are expected to easily adapt to environments designed for human, in fact they tend to tip over easily on real environments. For a practical use, it is one of important issues to stabilize a biped walking on an unexpected slippery floor with a low friction. In this paper, we propose the slip observer detecting skids that would occur at walking on unexpected slippery floor. We also propose a basic study of slip stabilizer towards reducing posture rolling caused by skids. Finally, we present experimental results using a humanoid robot HRP-2 to verify the validity of the proposed control scheme.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In robot and sensor networks, one of the key challenges is to decide when and where to deploy sensory resources to gather information of optimal value. The problem is essentially one of planning, scheduling and controlling the sensors in the network to acquire data from an environment that is constantly varying. The dynamic nature of the problem precludes the use of traditional rule-based strategies that can handle only quasi-static context changes. Automatic context derivation procedures are thus essential for providing fault recovery and fault pre-emption in such systems. We posit that the quality of a sensor network configuration depends on sensor coverage and geometry, sensor allocation policies, and the dynamic processes in the environment. In this paper, we show how these factors can be manipulated in an adaptive framework for robust run-time resource management. We demonstrate our ideas in a people tracking application using a network of multiple cameras. The task specification for our multi-camera network is one of allocating a camera pair that can best localize a human subject given the current context. The system automatically derives policies for switching between camera pairs that enable robust tracking while being attentive to performance measures. Our approach is unique in that we do not make any a priori assumptions about the scene or the activities that take place in the scene. Models of motion dynamics in the scene and the camera network configuration steer the policies to provide robust tracking.",

The proposed approach is an approximation, which allows the calculation of the gain without keeping track of all the correlations (i.e. with a complexity independent of the number of the map elements). Furthermore, the paper presents an explicit mathematical demonstration showing that the correlations computed by the EKF-based SLAM are overestimated. More precisely, it is shown that these correlations decrease exponentially with respect to the heading error of the robot. The approach is empirically demonstrated by means of meaningful simulations. The results are then discussed and conclusions are pointed out in the last section.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel method for the separation of monaurally recorded speech signals based on pitch. Our method is inspired by the ability of some auditory neurons to phase lock with the excitation signal. After applying a Gammatone filter-bank on the original signal we compare the distances between zero crossings of possible harmonics and decide upon the result of this comparison if they share the same fundamental and hence originate from the same sound source. For higher frequencies we use the amplitude modulation property of unresolved harmonics to determine their fundamental frequency. When comparing our method to standard autocorrelation based methods we see that the pitch can be tracked more precisely and especially opens the way to extract also the pitch contour of a second speaker or other sound sources which can be of importance for the robots behavior. Tests in sound source separation of our algorithm on a database with several speakers and a large set of intrusions show that our algorithm performs slightly better than the commonly used autocorrelation at lower computational costs.",

        "abstract": "In human-robot communication, a robot should distinguish between voices uttered by a human and those played by a loudspeaker such as on a TV or a radio. This paper addresses detection of actual human voices by using a microphone array as an extension of auditory function of the robot to support environmental understanding by the robot. We introduce a 64 ch microphone array system in a room and propose a new method based on weighted delay-and-sum beamforming to estimate a directivity pattern of a sound source. The microphone array system localizes a sound source and estimates its directivity pattern. The directivity pattern estimation has two advantages as follows: One is that the system can detect whether the sound source is an actual human voice or not by comparing the estimated directivity pattern with prerecorded directivity patterns. The other is that the heading of the sound source is estimated by detecting the angle with the highest power in the directivity pattern. As a result, we proved the effectiveness of our microphone array through sound source tracking with orientation and detection of actual human voices based on directivity pattern estimation.",

        "abstract": "Recently, there have been a number of variant simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms that have made substantial progress towards large-area scalability by parameterizing the SLAM posterior within the information (canonical/inverse covariance) form. Of these, probably the most well known and popular approach is the sparse extended information filter (SEIF) by Thrun et al. While SEIFs have been successfully implemented with a variety of challenging real world datasets and have led to new insights into scalable SLAM, open research questions remain regarding the approximate sparsification procedure and its effect on map error consistency. In this paper, we examine the constant time SEIF sparsification procedure in depth and offer new insight into issues of consistency. In particular, we show that exaggerated map inconsistency occurs within the global reference frame where estimation is performed, but that empirical testing shows that relative local map relationships are preserved. We then present a slightly modified version of their sparsification procedure, which is shown to preserve sparsity while also generating both local and global map estimates comparable to those obtained by the nonsparsified SLAM filter. While this modified approximation is no longer constant time, it does serve as a theoretical benchmark against which to compare SEIFs constant time results. We demonstrate our findings by benchmark comparison of the modified and original SEIF sparsification rule using simulation in the linear Gaussian SLAM case and real world experiments for a nonlinear dataset.",

However, most research has dealt with only interaction between one robot and one person and assumed that the distance between them does not change. This paper focuses on the spatial relationships between a robot and multiple people during interaction. Based on the distance between them, our robot selects appropriate functions to use. It does this using a method we developed for spatially mapping the friendliness of each space around the robot. The robot interacts with the highest friendliness spaces (people) selectively, thereby enabling interaction between the robot and multiple people. Our humanoid robot, SIG2 which the proposed method was implemented into, interacted with about 30 visitors, at the Kyoto University Museum. The results obtained using questionnaires after interaction showed that the actions of SIG2 were easy to understand even when it interacted with multiple people at the same time and that SIG2 behaved in a friendly manner.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous mobile agent navigation is crucial to many mission-critical applications (e.g., search and rescue missions in a disaster area). In this paper, we present how sensor networks may assist probabilistic roadmap methods (PRMs), a class of efficient navigation algorithms particularly suitable for dynamic environments. A key challenge of applying PRM algorithms in dynamic environment is that they require the spatiotemporal sensing of the environment to solve a given navigation problem. To facilitate navigation, we propose a set of query strategies that allow a mobile agent to periodically collect real-time information (e.g., fire conditions) about the environment through a sensor network. Such strategies include local spatiotemporal query (query of spatial neighborhood), global spatiotemporal query (query of all sensors), and border query (query of the border of danger fields). We investigate the impact of different query strategies through simulations under a set of realistic fire conditions. We also evaluate the feasibility of our approach using a real robot and real motes. Our results demonstrate that (1) spatiotemporal queries from a sensor network result in significantly better navigation performance than traditional approaches based on on-board sensors of a robot; (2) the area of local queries represent a tradeoff between communication cost and navigation performance; (3) through in-network processing our border query strategy achieves the best navigation performance at a small fraction of communication cost compared to global spatiotemporal queries.",

First, we model a dynamic control system on contact with a soft interface. The system is described in continuous-discrete time. Second, we formulate the dynamics using the modified z-transform in the continuous-discrete time system for feedback and feedforward control. Thus, we show that the stability of the system depends on viscoelasticity of the soft interface for feedback control. In particular, we point out that, in critical stability, the relationship between material viscosity and sampling time is not monotonous. Next, we analyze this phenomenon by the root locus method. Finally, we compare the stability analysis by the modified z-transform, simulations based on the Runge-Kutta method, and a regular z-transform. Thus, we demonstrate that the relationship is specific to the continuous-discrete time system.",

The avoidance of unexpected rotation of the supporting foot is treated via the control of the zero moment point or ZMP. When the task is a simultaneous control of the joints and of the ZMP, the system becomes under-actuated in the sense that there is less inputs than the number of outputs. The control law is defined in such a way that only the geometric evolution of the biped configuration is controlled, but not the temporal evolution. The temporal evolution during the geometric tracking is completely defined and can be analyzed through the study of a model with one degree of freedom. Simple conditions, which guarantee the existence of a cyclic motion and the convergence towards this motion, are deduced.",

By introducing a concept of fictitious zero-moment (FZMP), a method to maintain the whole body stability of robot under disturbance is presented. The support polygon and the rotation edge in the case of losing balance are determined by means of simulation. In order to maintain stability in different environments a new control strategy is presented including the adjustment of the support polygon, the push or pull support of hand with environment, the movement of upper robot body.

This pivotal ankle joint can not be actuator-driven but is passive with a rotary damper. Therefore these robots are intrinsically unstable under the effect of gravity and considered to be under-actuated and nonholonomically constrained. This paper first introduces an (n $1)-dimensional configuration manifold for such robots with n joints, which is called the ZMM (zero moment manifold) and defined as a set of joint angle vectors that satisfy zero of the rotational moment around the first ankle joint. It is shown theoretically that any motion starting from any given posture on a subset of the ZMM and targeting to a desired form of motion can be stabilized by using a coordinated control composed of gravity compensation for other joints except the ankle and PD feedback despite of the existence of a nonholonomic constraint. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by numerical simulation and experimental results using a gymnastics robot with four joints.",

        "abstract": "The formation task achieved by multiple robots is a tough issue because of the limitations of the sensing abilities and communicating functions among them. Due to an individual robot can only handle local information, an adjacency graph is applied to describe the relationship among multiple robots. Since the relative positions among robots change from time to time, the topology graph describing information exchange is variant. A local control strategy is proposed for an individual robot based on NN control with robust terms. It has been proved that under an assumption of adjacency matrices associated with interaction graph being always connected, the system will converge based on the individual control strategy and multiple robots can construct an unique formation even if interaction topology is variant.",

In another work, we have demonstrated that employing an information-driven approach to exploration with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) can drive the robot to locations in the world where filter updates are ill-conditioned and linearization constraints are violated, potentially destabilizing the filter, and increasing the probability of divergence from the true state estimate. In this paper, we demonstrate an information-driven approach to exploration that preserves the stability of the EKF and produces maps that are significantly more accurate than a conventional information-driven approach. Our method is based on range-gating observations so as to avoid potentially destabilizing updates. We provide simulated experimental results demonstrating the superior performance of our approach over simple outlier gating and over heuristic-driven exploration.",

In the new robot hand, the authors mainly focus on additions of the degrees of freedom of independent motion to the terminal fingers and the degree of freedom of twisting motion to the thumb. Experiments were carried out to investigate force control characteristics of the finger tip joint. The results showed that providing the finger tip with rich force control performance even with weak force is effective for securing delicate control characteristics in a humanoid robot hand.",

It is necessary to construct the function approximator adaptively, because the value function and the policy function change along with the progress of reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose self-organizing basis network (SOBN) which is the method that constructs a function approximator using basis functions adaptively. The proposed method constructs a basis function network by connecting neighbor bases using edges. This basis function network constrains the activating region of each basis function, and the network is modified by updating the location of each basis. Using this mutual dependence, which we call the interaction between basis functions, for searching appropriate architecture of a function approximator, SOBN self-organizes the function approximator. Assuming that the method is applied to reinforcement learning, we apply the method to the function approximation problem, and evaluate approximation performance and convergence time.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, steering characteristics of an exploration rover on loose soil is studied. Analysis of the steering characteristics is a key to plan and control the motion trajectory of a rover. Traditionally, such analysis has been made based on a model called \"bicycle model.\" In that model, a four-wheel car-like vehicle is approximated by a two-wheel bicycle-like vehicle with the fore-wheels and the rear-wheels paired. However, the bicycle model does not show a good performance when a vehicle travels off-road. In order to analyze the steering characteristics of a vehicle on loose soil, the authors develop a model that respects the dynamics of each wheel's slip and skid behavior. The developed model is called all-wheel dynamics model. In the all-wheel dynamics model, the behavior of each wheel on loose soil is modeled based on terramechanics. The motion trajectory of the vehicle is obtained by numerical simulation using the wheel-and-vehicle dynamics model. The validity of the proposed model is examined by the experiments of a wheel and a vehicle using simulated lunar-surface soil. The experimental results show that the proposed model provides a better approximation than the traditional bicycle model.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports on the continued development of a new concept for a personal vehicle called the 'personal riding-type wheeled mobile platform (PMP)' that consists of two wheels and a standing base for a human rider. The two wheels are driven independently, and forward and backward movement and steering are achieved by simply changing the relative position of the rider's center of gravity (COG) on the base. The vehicle has two distinct advantages: a reduction in total weight through its simple structure and a space-saving design that does not use a steering unit. We have already proposed the first prototype (PMP-1) and its posture stabilizing and running control methods, and we have achieved proper forward and backward movement according to the rider's intentions. This paper describes our proposed structure for detecting the rider's COG on the base and the steering control method in order to achieve steering control by changing the position of the rider's COG and the second prototype (PMP-2) whose weight is smaller than 12kg. We also investigated the steering control method to improve maneuverability in various estimated standing poses. Our experimental results demonstrate that natural steering control can be achieved using the rider's COG based on the rider's intentions.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "When inserted into soft tissues, flexible needles with bevel tips have been shown experimentally to follow a path of constant curvature in the direction of the bevel. By controlling 2 degrees of freedom at the needle base (bevel direction and insertion distance), these needles can be steered around obstacles to reach targets inaccessible to rigid needles. Motion planning for needle steering is a type of nonholonomic planning for a Dubins car with no reversal. We develop a motion planning algorithm based on dynamic programming where the path of the needle is uncertain due to uncertainty in tissue properties, needle mechanics, and interaction forces. The algorithm computes a discrete control sequence of insertions and direction changes so the needle reaches a target in an imaging plane while minimizing expected cost due to insertion distance, direction changes, and obstacle collisions. We efficiently sample the state space of needle tip positions and orientations and define bounds on the errors due to discretization. We formulate the motion planning problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and use infinite horizon dynamic programming to compute an optimal control sequence. We first apply the method to the deterministic motion case where the needle precisely follows a path of constant curvature and then to the uncertain motion case where state transitions are defined by a probability distribution. Our implementation generates motion plans for bevel-tip needles that reach targets inaccessible to rigid needles and demonstrates that accounting for uncertainty can lead to significantly different motion plans.",

The gait are composed of single support phases and impacts. The biped is underactuated in single support because there is no motor in the ankles. The observer and the control law converge in finite-time. The originality is both: firstly, the observer is based on second-order sliding mode approach and is original in biped robot context Secondly, the estimation of all state variables are derived from only actuated joint variables, which induces a minimization of the sensors number. Numerical tests are proposed to show the robustness of the observer coupled with the control.",

This paper explores a novel six degree-of-freedom large workspace flexure parallel mechanism based on the concept of wide-range flexure hinge, which can attain sub-micron scale accuracy over cubic centimeter motion range. The geometric dimensions of the flexure hinges utilized in this mechanism as passive joints will influence the system stiffness directly and other properties indirectly such as the workspace, load-carrying capacity, and driving-load capacity etc. In this paper, the stiffness model of individual flexure hinge is established firstly, and then the stiffness of the whole flexure mechanism is modeled via assembling stiffness matrices and formulating constraint equations. Based on the system stiffness model of the whole mechanism, the stiffness atlases' analysis is presented which provides theoretical principles for designing and developing this kind of flexure parallel mechanism in further. Finally, a 6-PSS large workspace flexure parallel mechanism prototype is proposed according to the analysis results, which will be utilized in the precision positioning.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new methodology for generating a straight legged walking pattern for a biped robot utilizing up-and-down motion of an upper body. Firstly, we define two new indexes, the knee stretch index (KSI) and the knee torque index (KTI), which indicate how efficiently the knee joints are utilized. Next, up-and-down motion of the upper body is automatically planned so that these indexes are optimized and straight legged walking is realized. The basic idea of the proposed method is: i) when a large number of DOFs of motion are required for controlling the ZMP, a robot makes its body height lower; ii) when there is a extra number of DOFs of motion, the body is lifted and the knee joint is stretched. By stretching the knee joints, human-like natural walking motion is obtained. Moreover, energy efficiency is improved since required torque and energy consumption to support the body weight become small at knee joints. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by computer simulation and experiments using a humanoid robot, HOAP-1.",

Three images are acquired sequentially from the left, right, and again from the left camera. A virtual image from the left camera synchronized with the right image is created by interpolating matching points of interest (SIFT features) in the two left images. Both geometric and probabilistic criteria are used to select the correct set of matching features amongst the three views. In an indoor environment, the method typically results in 3D structure with approximately 200 feature points, with a median 3D accuracy of 1.6 cm when the average depth is 3 m and the robot has moved 1-2 cm between each image acquisition.",

The child robot composed with the arm part and the wheel part has two moving modes: locomotion mode and manipulation mode. According to the mechanical characteristics, we proposed the two methods for the motion planning of swerving locomotion. The results of experiments showed that the robot can achieve turn during locomotion by adjusting the arm's attitude. But the child robot's radius of left-hand turning motion during locomotion is bigger much than the radius of right-hand turning motion during locomotion and the effect is not obvious. The method of spot turning is presented by use of the difference between radial frictional force and tangential frictional force of ground and direction wheel, which is important for robot for autonomous locomotion.",

Another motion is defined as a robot motion characteristic, and newly added to these two motions. Subjects were elderly and young people, and the evaluations of the motion's impressions are compared in two different age groups. Results indicated that there are age differences of evaluation between three types of manipulation's motions. Elderly people show more reliability and familiarity in a robot motion than that of the other two motions. In addition, elderly people seem to be more influenced by manipulator's motion than that of young peoples.

The purpose of the classifier is to provide physical context to a separate system that mitigates unnecessary distractions, allowing the driver to maintain focus during periods of high difficulty. While watching videos of driving, we asked different users to indicate their perceptions of the current situation. We then trained a classifier to emulate the human recognition of driving situations using the Sandia Cognitive Framework. In unstructured conditions, such as driving in urban areas and the German autobahn, the classifier was able to correctly predict human perceptions of driving situations over 95% of the time. This paper focuses on the learning algorithms used to train the driving-situation classifier. Future work will reduce the human efforts needed to train the system.",

The method is verified experimentally with wood, Styrofoam packaging material, white painted wall, white and black cloth, and white, brown, and violet paper. A correct differentiation rate of 100% is achieved for six surfaces and the surfaces are localized within absolute range and azimuth errors of 0.2 cm and 1.1/spl deg/, respectively. The differentiation rate decreases to 86% for seven surfaces and to 73% for eight surfaces. The method demonstrated shows that simple IR sensors, when coupled with appropriate processing, can be used to differentiate different types of surfaces in a location-invariant manner.",

Also, we describe a memory system which utilizes the neural network dynamics and hierarchically maintains specific and conceptual memories of motions of humanoid robots.

        "abstract": "In this paper, a new tactile telepresence system is developed. The new system consists of a multi-channel polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) tactile sensor, a friction-type electrostatic tactile display, and a master-slave control system. The tactile sensor, which is situated in the slave site, is equipped with a contact force control unit to reproduce a finger-object contact condition at the master site. Also, the tactile sensor works with a linear motor stage to reproduce the operator's finger motion while exploring a surface. The finger's exploring motion and contact force are measured by sensor systems embedded in the tactile display at the master site. With these units, the system realizes master-slave surface texture presentation. In past research, the electrostatic tactile display showed good performance in displaying uniform and periodic surface textures, or surface roughness. In this research, it was demonstrated that the electrostatic tactile display is also able to display localized or non-uniform surface textures, such as a bump or a step, by extending its control scheme.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Monitoring of environmental phenomena with embedded networked sensing confronts the challenges of both unpredictable variability in the spatial distribution of phenomena coupled with the demands for a high spatial sampling rate in three dimensions. For example, low distortion mapping of critical solar radiation properties in forest environments may require two-dimensional spatial sampling rates of greater than 10 samples/m/sup 2/ over transects exceeding 1000 m/sup 2/. Clearly, adequate sampling coverage of such transect requires an impractically large number of sensing nodes. A new approach, networked infomechanical system (NIMS), has been introduced to combine autonomous-articulated and static sensor nodes enabling sufficient spatiotemporal sampling density over large transects to meet a general set of environmental mapping demands. This paper describes our work on the critical parts of NIMS, the task allocation module. We present our methodologies and the two basic greedy task allocation policies - based on time of the task arrival (time policy) and distance from the robot to the task (distance policy). We present results from NIMS deployed in a forest reserve and from a lab testbed. The results show that both policies are adequate for the task of spatiotemporal sampling, but also complement each other. Finally, we suggest the future direction of research that would both help us better quantify the performance of our system and create more complex policies.",

To achieve this goal, we propose a task model of lower body motion, which consists of task primitives (what to do) and skill parameters (how to do it). Based on this model, a sequence of task primitives and their skill parameters are detected from human motion, and robot motion is regenerated from the detected result under constraints of a robot. This model can generate human-like lower body motion including various waist motions as well as various stepping motions of the legs. Generated motions can be performed stably on an actual robot supported by its own legs. We used improved robot hardware HRP-2, which has superior features in body weight, actuators, and DOF of the waist. By using the proposed method and HRP-2, we have realized a dance performance of Japanese folk dance by the robot, which is synchronized with a performance of a human grand master on the same stage.",

However, the formulations and results obtained for the rigid-link mechanisms cannot be directly applied to CDPMs due to the unilateral property of cables. For a CDPM, cable tensions appear to be the most important part in analyzing kinetostatic issues such as stability, workspace, stiffness, etc. This paper mainly focuses on the tension analysis issue. The equilibrium constraints such as force-closure condition, feasible wrench condition and wrench set condition are addressed. Generic analysis approaches based on dimension reduction techniques, which are successfully implemented through computationally effective recursive algorithms, are proposed.",

The XBC is a new design for a robot controller merging a modern ARM processor with an FPGA that allows high performance - especially in vision processing and motor control - for a cost similar to controllers with a fraction of its capabilities. Additionally, the XBC uses a new, and still free, software development system, already in wide use. The XBC is being mass produced (at least in research hardware terms) so it is readily available and does not require computer hardware or electronics skills in order to be obtained. This paper describes the system, its capabilities and some potential applications.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "One of the earliest motivations for developing humanoid robots centered on creating robots that may coexist with humans in environments created for human beings. For several years, at Waseda University, the development of the anthropomorphic flutist player has been focused on improving the musical interaction between the human and the robot to clarify the human flute playing and to propose novel assisted music teaching tools. In this paper, a new architecture for autonomously transferring skills from robot to human using the flutist robot is introduced. Furthermore, the new version of the flutist robot, the WF-4R (Waseda Flutist No.4 Refined) is presented; where the arm system was added to assure the positioning accuracy of the flute and the development of a melody recognition system to enable the robot to interact with students at the same logical level of perception. An experimental setup has been performed in order to verify the effectiveness of both mechanical and perceptual systems. As a result, using the arms system, we have assured the repetitiveness of the flute positioning. Furthermore, the implemented music recognition system was able to recognize the melody of flutist players (an overall recognition rate of 90%); demonstrating that HMM (usually used for speech recognition) is also effective for flute melody identification.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel type of 3D scanning system named 'climbing sensor'. This system has been designed for scanning narrow and vertically stalky spaces, which are hard or extremely inefficient to scan by commercial laser range scanners due to their dimensions and limitation of FOVs. The climbing sensor equips a platform with two line scanners on a lift, and they scan through the whole target while the lift moves downwards along a ladder. One scanner is for scanning the target, which scans horizontally as the lift moves vertically, and the other scanner is for localizing the platform, which scans vertically. By using spatio-temporal range image acquired from the vertical scanning, we can accurately calculate the speed of the moving platform, with which a correct 3D model can be constructed from horizontal scans. We applied this scanning system to the Bayon Temple in Cambodia as a part of our digital archiving project of cultural assets. The scanning results proved that the system gives a sufficiently accurate 3D model and the effectiveness of our proposed system and speed estimating process.",

        "abstract": "The mechanism of the sensory-to-motor transformation as well as motor-to-sensory transformation of human beings has attracted much attention in recent years. As no efficient device can record hand intrinsic behavior, it is difficult to get its neuro-physiological models of sensory-motor coordination. In this paper, we offer a system to acquire the kinematics and kinetics information of human hand movement through handwriting. Joined with human being, an eye-brain-hand to computer (EBH-C) interaction system is presented. In this human-in-the-loop-testing system, human beings acquire image, voice or text from computer by eyes or ears then write them down. The core part of the system, named as F-Tablet/spl trade/ is able to acquire the trajectory and three-axis forces of pen-tip directly and simultaneously. With the help of this system, we designed an experiment to evaluate the handwriting movements and forces controlling ability of different ages. Some experiment results were present. Aided with conventional analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), the whole procedures of information transmitting, acquired by eyes and ears, processed by brain, outputted and actuated by hand, can be recorded.",

        "abstract": "Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a common technique that is performed on video sequences in a number of computer vision and robotics applications. The left singular vectors represent the eigenimages, while the right singular vectors represent the temporal properties of the video sequence. It is obvious that spatial reduction techniques affect the left singular vectors; however, the extent of their effect on the right singular vectors is not clear. Understanding how the right singular vectors are affected is important because many SVD algorithms rely on computing them as an intermediate step to computing the eigenimages. The work presented here quantifies the effects of different spatial resolution reduction techniques on the right singular vectors that are computed from those video sequences. Examples show that using random sampling for spatial resolution reduction rather than a low-pass filtering technique results in less perturbation of the temporal properties.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the obstacle avoidance problem in difficult scenarios that usually are dense, complex and cluttered. The proposal is a method called the obstacle-restriction. At each iteration of the control cycle, this method addresses the obstacle avoidance in two steps. First there is procedure to compute instantaneous subgoals in the obstacle structure (obtained by the sensors). The second step associates a motion restriction to each obstacle, which are managed next to compute the most promising motion direction. The advantage of this technique is that it avoids common limitations of previous obstacle avoidance methods, improving their navigation performance in difficult scenarios. Furthermore, we obtain similar results to the recent methods that achieve navigation in troublesome scenarios. However, the new method improves their behavior in open spaces. The performance of this method is illustrated with experimental results obtained with a robotic wheelchair vehicle.",

        "abstract": "High mobility and large payload capabilities are important features for wall climbing robots. However, traditional designs could only provide one or other but not both of these features at the same time. In this paper, we propose a new robot system named \"Anchor Climber\", which can provide both high mobility and large payload capabilities. The proposed system is composed of two or more mobile units which can stick firmly to the wall when in a stand-still state, and also freely and reliably move on the wall holding enough adhering force to not fall from the wall during the moving state. We call this kind of unit as \"adhering mobile unit\". This paper address in detail, the necessary conditions to configure such a system, and also introduces the development of an adhering mobile unit using permanent magnet.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a novel approach to powering a radical type of microrobot. Our long-term aim is to enable the construction of ensembles of millions of coordinated near-spherical, submillimeter microrobots. Both the large number of potential simultaneous neighbors of each robot (12) and the difficulty of fine actuation at such small scales preclude the use of complex connectors previously developed in many modular robotics efforts. Instead, we propose to leverage multirobot cooperation to simplify the mechanics of modular robot docking. In our approach, the robots actively cooperate to route virtual power busses (both supply and ground) to all the robots in the ensemble using only unary (single conductor) electrical connectors between robots. A unary connector allows for larger tolerances in engagement angle, simplifies robot manufacture, speeds reconfiguration, and maximizes the proportion of the connector surface area useful for carrying current. The algorithms we present permit a robot ensemble to efficiently harvest and distribute power from sources discovered in the environment and/or carried by the ensemble. We evaluate these algorithms in a variety of simulated deployment conditions and report on the impact of hardware defects, limited on-board power storage, and the ensemble-environment interface.",

The basic idea is to realize an approach similar to force reflecting telerobotics. That is to say, bilateral coupling between thermal temperature and thermal flux variables. Thermal properties and exchange during contact are modeled with their relating equations. Similarly to force feedback coupling, four potential controllers are possible; we implemented all of them using stable and linear control schemes. Experimental results show that some coupling are superior in terms of thermal transparency and stability. We used two Peltier heat pumps as thermal sources; the one serving as a thermal display while the other one is to play the role of a \"robotic finger\".",

Arrangement of microphones is simulated and an optimized pattern which has three rings is implemented with 32 microphones. Sound localization and separation are achieved by delay and sum beam forming (DSBF) and frequency band selection (FBS). From on-line experiments results of sound horizontal and vertical localization, we confirmed that one or two sounds sources could be localized with an error of about 5 degrees and 200 to 300 mm in the case of the distance of about lm. The off-line experiments of sound separation were evaluated by power spectrums in each frequency of separated sounds, and we confirmed that an appropriate frequency band could be selected by DSBF and FBS. The system can separate 3 different pressure speech sources without drowning out.",

This paper describes the design, modeling, control, and data processing of a contact imager consisting of a flexible whisker mounted on a two-axis robot through a load cell. The whisker sweeps around and into contact with unknown objects, determining the 3-D location of contact points to within a specified position resolution. During contact, the whisker bends along the surface normal, producing large deflections. The joint angles and load cell signals are numerically processed using an elastica model to determine the whisker shapes. Comparison of whisker shapes during bending determines contact point location. Experimental results for several objects with wide ranging surface curvature and roughness demonstrate 1.51 cm RMS resolution for a 45.5 cm whisker.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this research is to develop a wearable power assist device which helps a person to lift up a heavy object. The device is designed to support him by holding his upper body weight and reducing his inner force. It turns to the reduction of a compression force of his lower back discs, which is a major factor of a lower back injury. In a lifting-up motion, he twists and bends his body, which means three-dimensional motion analysis is necessary for the compression force analysis. However, most of related works on the compression force analysis have been carried out in a vertical plane. For understanding the characteristics of a lifting-up motion better, this paper presents three-dimensional analysis of it. Using a motion capture system, we measured a sequence of body positions with and without the power assist device in different object location and mass, as well as surface EMG (electro-myogram) signals. The compression force of the lower back discs is estimated by a three-dimensional biomechanical human body model utilizing the position data. The results show that the range of the twist angle of his body is about 30 degree in maximum and the compression force increases about 10% due to the twist angle. With respect to the effect of the power assist device, the magnitude of the surface EMG signals of spine muscles is decreased when wearing the power assist device. It means the proposed power assist device gives a good support to him.",

The proposed control signal is composed of linear superposition of three terms: 1) angular-velocity feedback for damping shaping; 2) task-space position feedback with a single stiffness parameter; and 3) compensation for gravity force on the basis of estimates for uncertain parameters of the potential energy. Through a variety of computer simulations by using a whole arm model with five DOFs, the importance of synergistic adjustments of damping factors as well as its relation to selection of the stiffness parameter is pointed out. It is shown that if damping factors are chosen synergistically corresponding to the inertia matrix at the initial time and the stiffness parameter then the endpoint converges asymptotically to the target position and reaches it smoothly without incurring any self-motion.",

Such reference terms play an important role in human interaction by quickly informing the listener of an indicated object's location. In this research, we propose a three-layered draw-attention model for humanoid robots with gestures and verbal cues. Our proposed three-layered model consists of three sub models: reference term model (RTM), limit distance model (LDM) and object property model (OPM). RTM decides an appropriate reference term using functions constructed by an analysis of human behavior. LDM decides whether to use the object's property with a reference term. OPM decides the appropriate property for indicating the object by comparing object properties with each other. We developed an attention drawing system in a communication robot named \"Robovie\" based on the three layered model. We confirmed its effectiveness through the experiments.",

In this paper, three-tiered sensor network architecture is proposed to approach the novel traffic information service system that would dramatically improve the ways and qualities of traffic information collection. A brief analysis of the important requirements of system, as well as the key issues that are faced in the design process, is described. The detailed strategies at each level, from the network architecture, to the sensor unit configuration and software deployment, to the operation of system, are explained. The implementation of a pilot platform is discussed in the end.",

This interception problem is addressed by utilizing the velocity obstacle approach of Fiorni and Shiller augmented with a rendezvous-guidance algorithm. However, the velocity obstacle approach had to be modified to ensure that the real-time planned path deviates minimally from the one generated by the rendezvous-guidance algorithm. Simulation and experimental results, some of which are presented in this paper, clearly demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed interception method.",

Our long term aim is to combine robot control with task and assembly planning, so that with less human interaction manufacturing costs can be reduced. Even parallel kinematic machines provide enormous opportunities to reduce cycle times and thus the benefit should not be wasted by expensive specialized robot programming. Thus, we give an overview of our system and focus on some aspects to implement such a sophisticated system.",

Our objective is to present in this paper the design of the electronics developed for these robots, taking into account the important challenges regarding the available area, and that the robot should possess enough autonomy. The most versatile solution is pursued because a particular electronics is not to be developed for each specialized robot.

This paper argues that robotics is particularly well-suited for and in need of component-based ideas. Furthermore, now is the right time for their introduction.

We also present preliminary results on 3D geometric mapping with incomplete data. Based on previously known models and incomplete data, our system is able to estimate parts of buildings which have never been seen before. As validation, we present experimental results using a Segway RMP vehicle in two environments, both approximately the size of a city block.",

This paper presents a study whose main goal is the development of a complementary sensor for a metal detector, based on the analysis of images taken by an on-board camera. The images are processed by developing texture and color analysis of different types of surfaces, composed mainly by grass or small rocks. Based on the color and texture analysis, this paper shows that it is possible to determine the presence of a non-metallic landmine within the image. This is achieved by finding the image regions whose texture features variations and color compositions are considered to be anomalous. It is thought that the texture variations over the image are an indicator that the surface has been intentionally modified. This image processing strategy is being integrated on the robot 'Ursula', designed at Universidad Javeriana in Colombia.",

However, an assist system for tracking task has not been studied well. In this paper, we aim to realize the human-machine system that assists a tracking task. In order to achieve the goal, the virtual friction field is proposed. Isotropic and anisotropic friction fields are presented and they are applied to the rotating object which should be tracked. The tracking task experiments are carried out and it is shown that the virtual guide of the friction improves the tracking performance effectively.",

The controller is designed based on model of mobile manipulators consisting of two cascaded subsystems: a chained-like kinematical model without uncertainties and a dynamical model with uncertainties. The proposed control law can ensure that full states of closed-loop system can track given trajectories in presence of dynamical uncertainties. A globally asymptotic stability is obtained in Lyapunov sense. Simulation studies show feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Furthermore, we propose a method for human hand trajectory reconstruction with NURBS curves by means of a best-fit data smoothing algorithm.

The objective here is to find robot trajectories that maximise the accuracy of the locations of the targets at a prescribed terminal time. The trajectory planning is formulated as an optimal control problem for a nonlinear system with a gradually identified model and then solved using nonlinear model predictive control (MPC). The solution to the MPC optimisation problem is computed through exhaustive expansion tree search (EETS) plus sequential quadratic programming (SQP). Simulations were conducted using the proposed methods. Results show that EETS alone performs considerably faster than EETS+SQP with only minor differences in information gain, and that a centralised approach outperforms a decentralised one in terms of information gain. We show that a centralised EETS provides a near optimal solution. We also demonstrate the significance of using a matrix to represent the information gathered.",

        "abstract": "In automatic guidance of agriculture vehicles, lateral control is not the only requirement. Lots of research works have been focused on trajectory tracking control which can provide high longitudinal-lateral control accuracy. Satisfactory results have been reported as soon as vehicles move without sliding. But unfortunately pure rolling constraints are not always satisfied especially in agriculture applications where working conditions are rough and not expectable. In this paper the problem of trajectory tracking control of autonomous farm vehicles in presence of sliding is addressed. To take sliding effects into account, two variables which characterize sliding effects are introduced into the kinematic model based on geometric and velocity constrains in presence of sliding. With linearization approximation a refined kinematic model is obtained in which sliding appears as additive unknown parameters to the ideal kinematic model. By integrating parameter adaptation technique with backstepping method, a stepwise procedure is proposed to design a robust adaptive controller. It is theoretically proven that for the farm vehicles subjected to sliding, the longitudinal-lateral deviations can be stabilized near zero and the orientation errors converge into a neighborhood near the origin. To be more realistic for agriculture applications, an adaptive controller with projection mapping is also proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed (robust) adaptive controllers can guarantee high trajectory tracking accuracy regardless of sliding.",

We propose two evaluation indexes of whole shape of the redundant manipulators. First one is sum of singular value of avoidance matrix. Second one is sum of the volume of avoidance manipulability ellipsoid. We evaluate whole manipulator's shape by two indexes and compare the ability. We found the second one is better than the first. We call the second index avoidance manipulability shape index (AMSI). Finally, by using AMSI, we construct trajectory tracking/obstacle avoidance control system.

A pulse modulated driving voltage excites temporal distribution of standing SAW. The distribution generates friction shift on the surface of a SAW substrate. When the surface with the burst SAW is explored, the friction shift can be perceived as tactile sensation at mechanoreceptors in the finger skin. Controlling the burst frequency according to measured rubbing motion, reality of the displayed sensation can be enhanced. In this paper, we proposed a transparent tactile display. An experimental apparatus was fabricated on trial and controlled by using captured images. The apparatus demonstrated potentiality of the tactile display for various applications.",

SIMO-model-based ICA can separate the mixed signals, not into monaural source signals but into SIMO-model-based signals from independent sources as they are at the microphones. Thus, the separated signals of SIMO-model-based ICA can maintain the spatial qualities of each sound source, and this yields that binary mask processing can be applied to efficiently remove the residual interference components after SIMO-model-based ICA. The experimental results obtained with a human-like head reveal that the separation performance can be considerably improved by using the proposed method in comparison to the conventional ICA-based and binary-mask-based BSS methods.",

        "abstract": "We show that landmark based localisation (LBL) and Lowe's model-based localisation (MBL) are complementary in that LBL provides a pose initialisation to MBL, which is a necessary input to the algorithm, and MBL can then refine that pose to give a more accurate pose estimate than LBL alone can provide. For LBL, we extend Betke and Gurvit's method, such that it can be used with standard perspective cameras (their original proposal was for omnidirectional cameras) in order to get a useful initial value as an input to Lowe's method. Intensive experiments have been carried out to analyse how camera parameters (intrinsic and extrinsic) affect the LBL position and orientation errors in the initial pose estimate. In error propagation experiments, we show that the position and orientation of a robot are sensitive to focal length and errors in imaged feature positions respectively. In the MBL pose refinement phase, we find that MBL is able to refine the position estimate, but the error in orientation estimate remains the same.",

We believe that there is a need for a standard which could be universal, powerful and easy to use. The open source project URBI, a universal robotic body interface, aims at providing the ground for such a standard. It is based on a client/server architecture where the server is running on the robot and accessed by the client, on the robot or remotely via TCP/IP. The URBI language is a scripted language used by the client and capable of controlling the joints of the robot or access its sensors, camera, speakers or any accessible part of the machine. We present in this article an introduction to URBI and we describe how URBI differs from currently existing solutions. As an example making use of URBI-specific features, we present a simple perturbative approach to walk pattern generation, with URBI running on a ERS7 Aibo robot.",

The simulated world is built by composing a simulation space and placing in it operational components such as appliances, sensors, persons, robots etc. Each operational component continuously generates context data, which are fed to the plugged platform. The platform builds world model by interpreting the context data stream. Operational components in the simulation space expose services through semantic Web service scheme, through which plugged platform can affect the simulated world. Semantic Web service scheme enables automated discovery of services dynamically coming and going in the simulation space. The framework can be used to observe how robots interact with environment via ubiquitous network. We discuss two advanced usages of URSF: intelligent robot manipulation and mixed robot-reality manifestation.",

        "abstract": "Visual servoing of constrained dynamical robots has not yet met a formal treatment. Also, notices that due technological constraints, this task is done slowly at velocity reversals, thus dynamic friction arises, which complicates even more the problem. In this paper, a new adaptive scheme for visual servoing of constrained robots subject to dynamic friction is proposed. An image-based control is introduced to produce simultaneous convergence of the constrained visual position and the contact force between the end-effector and the constraint surface. Camera and robot parameters are considered uncertain. This new approach is based on a new formulation of the orthogonalization principle used in force control, coined here visual orthogonalization principle. This allows, under the framework of passivity, to yield a synergetic scheme that fuses camera, encoder and force sensor signals. Simulation results are presented and show that image errors and force errors converge despite uncertainties of friction model.",

        "abstract": "While in calibrated settings trajectories can be planned so to avoid singular or poorly observable configurations, in uncalibrated visual servoing in general a priori information about singularities (visual or robotic) may be unavailable. Instead we propose a method where trajectories are corrected online to avoid singular and near singular regions. Mathematically this is achieved using a so called nullspace-biased Newton step in a visual servoing with a Broyden type Jacobian estimation. The bias is applied so to first hand use (any) robot redundancy and thus not compromise the visually specified aspects of the trajectory. The closeness to a singular region is measured online from the estimated visual motor Jacobian. We also illustrate how to apply the bias method for simple visual obstacle avoidance. To show the practical applicability of our method we have applied it to Barrett WAM and PUMA560 manipulators and tested both numerous real trajectories, as well as run exhaustive simulations around critical configurations using a simulation model to confirm empirically that both safe and efficient trajectories are chosen around singular regions.",

This is not the case when using bearing-only information because the distance to the perceived landmarks is not directly provided. A whole estimate of a landmark position is only possible via a set of measurements taken from different points of view. The vast majority of contributions to this problem perform a parallel task to get this estimate, and hence the landmark initialization is delayed. We give a new insight to the problem and present a method to avoid this delay by initializing the whole ray that defines the direction of the landmark. We utilize a minimal and computationally efficient form to represent this ray and a new strategy for the subsequent updates. Simulations have been carried out to validate the proposed algorithms.",

Hence, the approach described in this work aims to avoid the analytical linearization based on Taylor-series expansion of both the model and measurement equations by using the unscented filter. An innovation-based consistency checking validates the feasibility and applicability of the unscented SLAM approach to a real large-scale outdoor exploration mission.",

Continuum robots present unique challenges due to the nonintuitive (to humans) nature of their basic movements. We present a series of mappings, at both position and velocity levels, which provide human operators with a versatile and intuitive suite of options for joystick control of continuum robots. Results from implementations on two types of continuum manipulator hardware are summarized.",

In this modeling large deformation for beam is considered and consequently, high order curvature terms are not neglected. An adaptation method for applying large moments in the beam tip is developed using FEM. Port Hamiltonian interconnected system modeling is used to model the resulted configuration. The energy-based variable structure method is utilized to develop an interconnected controller with energy function associated with a set of Casimir functions relating to sliding surfaces. The energy function of the controller is chosen to make an attractive sliding surface for closed-loop system.

The problem is complicated by the fact that the surface may include \"non-concurrently traversable\" segments, where narrow passages between surface cells may result in module collision, regardless of the space separating moving modules. We present a new algorithm to identify unoccupied cells that, when filled with modules, form bridges to span all non-concurrently traversable segments of the surface. Our bridging algorithms have the added benefit of reducing the overall traversal time for a given surface. Additionally, we show that four modules are sufficient to bridge any contiguous non-concurrently traversable segment, allowing concurrent module movement with minimal inter-module spacing. Finally, we present the results of simulating our algorithms using a discrete event simulator.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the planning and control of dynamic contact manipulation. In an earlier paper (Srinivasa et al., 2005), we derived a constraint on the robot joint accelerations that needed to be satisfied to obtain a desired contact mode and a desired dynamic motion of the object. We proposed a technique for trajectory planning which involved planning a path in the system configuration space followed by time-scaling the path to satisfy dynamic constraints. This paper tackles a problem where only a small set of paths can be time-scaled to satisfy the constraints. We note that the dynamic constraints depend only on a subspace of the system state space. Projecting the dynamics and the constraints onto the subspace allows us to compute an analytical solution for the trajectory generation problem. We generate controllable simulations by allowing the user to control the system in the space orthogonal to the projection. We also demonstrate the construction of feedback controllers using dynamic programming.",

In this paper, we firstly consider characteristics of electro-acoustic transducers and study the resulting acoustic diffraction. Then, we introduce a new method aiming to extract seabed features from the received acoustic echo. Thus, single beam sonar systems can be used for bottom tracking purposes.

Potential online assistance from network might be computers, digital sensors, database, even operators. It is currently an important issue of the Internet-based robotic system and can often lead to significant improvement in machine intelligence and system performance. In this paper a new approach utilizing network resources is proposed for indoor applications of our Internet-based robotic system. Developed with this strategy, the robot, instead of only being considered as a passive remote tool, can actively seek for help from assistant network resources for perception or intelligence enhancement. The layered framework of the Internet-based robotic system is outlined as application background, and the definition, implementation and utilizing strategy of network resources based on OAA (open agent architecture) discussed, with two practical examples as speech recognition and global vision perception given to demonstrate the potential applications. Finally, the integration to the framework of the Intranet/Internet-based robotic system with the example utilizations is presented.",

One of the techniques is tile coding, which is frequently used for reinforcement learning. The other is the mere reduction of the resolution of a policy. Moreover, we try applying VQ to already compressed policies. As a result, vector quantized policies and double vector quantized policies could mark better performance than the others.",

This takes place within the car park of INRIA Rhone-Alpes on the CyCab vehicle with a Sick laser range scanner. Our method uses only laser scanners to retrieve the position and orientations of vehicles in the car park. With the detected vehicles as landmarks, CyCab performs a localization of itself and builds a map of the car park at the same time. Classical clustering and segmentation techniques to extract line segments from the laser scan data are applied. The key contribution of the paper is the extraction of vehicle poses from the line segments using Bayesian programming. The method of FastSLAM is used in localizing CyCab and estimating the pose of vehicles in the car park. A set of hypotheses is obtained as a result. The second contribution is a method of combining the set of hypotheses together to form a final map of the car park.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a view-based localization method using support vector machines in outdoor environments. We have been developing a two-phase vision-based navigation method. In the training phase, the robot acquires image sequences along the desired route and automatically learns the route visually. In the subsequent autonomous navigation phase, the robot moves by localizing itself based on the comparison between input images and the learned route representation. Our previous localization method uses an object recognition method which is robust to changes of weather and the seasons; however it has many parameters and threshold values to be manually adjusted. This paper, therefore, applies a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to this object recognition problem. SVM is also applied to discriminating locations based on the recognition results. This two-stage SVM-based localization approach exhibits a satisfactory performance for real outdoor image data without any manual adjustment of parameters and threshold values.",

Correspondence between 3D points from successive stereo camera positions is established through matching of 2D SIFT features in the images. We compare three different methods for solving this estimation problem, based on three distance measures between 3D points, Euclidean distance, Mahalanobis distance and a distance measure defined by a maximum likelihood formulation. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the maximum likelihood formulation is the most accurate. If the measurement error is guaranteed to be small, then Euclidean distance is the fastest, without significantly compromising accuracy, and therefore it is best for on-line robot navigation.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel method for the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem with two cameras. A single camera based approach suffers from a lack of information for feature initialization and the instability of covariance of the 3D camera location and feature position. To solve this problem, we use two cameras which move independently, unlike the stereo camera. We derive new formulations for the extended Kalman filter and map management of two cameras. We also present a method for the new features initialization and feature matching with two cameras. In our method, the covariance of camera and feature location converges more rapidly. This characteristic enables a reduction of the computational complexity by fixing the feature position whose covariance converges. Experimental results prove that our approach estimates the 3D camera location and feature position more accurately and the covariance of camera and feature location converges more rapidly when compared with the single camera case.",

In this line of research, we present a cross-modal perceptual architecture that can segment objects based on visual-auditory sensorial cues, construct an associative sound-object memory, and create visual expectations of objects (attentional priming) using a sound recognition algorithm.",

We propose a novel method for the recognition of hand gestures, used by air marshals for steering aircraft on the runway, using the Radon transform. Various aspects of the algorithm, including acquisition, segmentation, labeling and recognition using the parametric Radon transform are addressed in this paper. A binary skeleton representation of the human subject is computed. The Radon transform is used to generate maxima corresponding to specific orientations of the skeletal representation. Feature vectors are extracted from the transform space by computing the normalized cumulative projections of the Radon transform on the angle axis. K-means clustering is then applied to recognize static gestures from the extracted features. This technique has the potential to provide information about the exact orientation of gesture segments and can find use in ground control of unmanned air vehicles. Experiments with image data corresponding to the various ground air traffic control gestures used in directing aircrafts, highlight the potential application of this approach.",

Only two pairs of natural line and point are used for the visual localization to take the advantage of fast detection. To track a given landmark model, Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm is applied by using gradient descent. We use the odometer data combined with visual information to determine the height of the landmark features. On-ground image features are used to calculate the homography between two image frames and to detect the planar region for navigation. Experimental results show the robustness of the method with respect to image illumination and noises. The performance in indoor environments shows the feasibility of the proposed visual navigation algorithm in realtime.",

        "abstract": "Mobile microrobots with piezo slip-stick actuation and more than one degree of freedom mostly do not have internal pose sensors. One possibility for fast pose estimation with high accuracy is the application of external visual sensors like a video camera in combination with a light microscope or a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In particular, the use of a SEM makes high demands on the image processing. High update rates of the pose data enforce a short image acquisition time of the SEM images. Hence, the image noise increases, because frame averaging or averaging of the detector signal is time consuming. This paper presents a method to calculate the x, y position and the orientation of a micro gripper in a strongly noised SEM image stream with cross-correlation in real-time. To make real-time pose estimation possible, only a region-of-interest (ROI) is correlated with the target pattern. The SEM is almost predestined to work with ROI's, because the scan area of the electron beam can be chosen arbitrarily. At the beginning of the paper, the setup of the used mobile microrobot based nanohandling station was described briefly.",

To navigate without collision, some kind of environment representation is needed. This paper presents a new methodology to build, in real-time, compact local maps for navigation in complex indoor environments. The map is called Traversable Regions Model (TRM) and is based on Voronoi diagram techniques. The new approach is the application of Voronoi techniques in 3D environments and the previous study of tr avers ability in indoor environments. The model built allows to define safe trajectories depending on the robot's capabilities and the terrain properties, because a previous traversability study is performed with the 3D data. The methodology presented is validated in real indoor environments with the mobile manipulator MANFRED, developed in our lab.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents walking control of a novel omni-directional locomotion interface with a dual-planar parallel robot. The suggested interface can generate infinite floor on planar surfaces, allowing user's upright and turning walking motions. To provide continuous walking in a confined area, a walking control algorithm is suggested for planar surfaces. For continuous walking, each independent platform of the locomotion interface will follow a human foot during the swing phase, while the platforms will move back during single stance phase. For accurate foot tracking control, magnetic trackers are attached on each shoe with careful calibration and transition phases between the swing and the stance phases are detected by using switch system, which is composed of light steel plate, spring, and micro switch. For double limb support, two platforms will manipulate neutral positions to compensate the offset errors generated by velocity change. This algorithm can satisfy natural walking conditions for any directions of planar surfaces. From experimental results, a subject can walk naturally for upright motions without significant limitations, while limitations of maximum yaw angle of 20/spl deg/ are applied to each platform to prevent the collisions of two platforms during turning motions. By using the suggested interface, it is anticipated that a user can interact with virtual normal pathways by real walking including upright and turning motions.",

Although such human-like biped walking is strongly affected by the terrain dynamics, it was not taken into account in robotic bipedalism since it is very difficult to model the dynamics formally. In this paper, instead of modeling the dynamics formally, we propose to estimate the relationship between actuation (air valve opening duration) and sensing (touch sensor information) by real walking trials, and to stabilize walking cycle by utilizing it. Since the terrain dynamics is involved in the relation, we can avoid to model it formally. We conducted walking experiments on various types of terrain to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Wave variables have been used to overcome the transmission delay of a system from the viewpoint of passivity. During implementation of the wave transformation for the sampled-data system, a unit delay arises due to causality of the reflection wave. The property of the wave transformation using delayed reflection, which is different from the standard wave transformation, can be verified with the passivity condition of the scattering matrix. The unit delay on the reflection wave occasionally becomes a positive damping. From the passivity condition of the sampled-data system, the wave impedance can be designed such that the wave transformation using delayed reflection wave provides the effect of positive damping. As an example, the wave transformation using delayed reflection wave makes it possible that the stable haptic interface is achieved on the sampled-data system with appropriate wave impedance. The simulation and the experiment results show that the stable haptic interface can be accomplished by use of the wave transformation using delayed reflection.",

Few wanted a robot companion to be a friend. Household tasks were preferred to child/animal care tasks. Humanlike communication was desirable for a robot companion, whereas humanlike behaviour and appearance were less essential.

        "abstract": "Robots working in complex environment require accurate perception of a wide field of view. Using cameras, hybrid motion stereo, which combines the computations by stereo vision and motion stereo, is capable of acquiring positional information of the whole field of view. However, the technique generates errors in computation by motion stereo when tracking feature points fails. This paper describes a method to reject the outliers to avoid erroneous recognition. The method uses computation results from several previous images, computing the spatial deviation and temporal deviation of points, and rejecting those considered to be deviated. The evaluation function is composed with a weighted average of the sequential results, each with a weight of the total number of points existing in the neighboring space, which represents the spatial deviation. Experimental results using the humanoid robot HRP-2 denote the effectiveness of the method.",

        "abstract": "When a human needs to apply a large force to an environment, the human takes an appropriate posture to produce a large manipulation force. This paper discusses appropriate working postures for a humanoid robot to apply a force effectively to an environment. An objective function is defined and the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) is used to find a solution. The pushing a wall and turning a valve are taken as examples of tasks for a humanoid robot, and simulations and experimentations are performed. The results show that the consideration of working postures clearly contributes to make the manipulation force larger.",

        "abstract": "Wound roll electroactive polymer actuators fabricated with dielectric elastomer (DE) materials provide high bandwidth actuation for robots, minipumps, loudspeakers, valves and prosthetic devices. In this paper, we develop a DE wound roll actuator fabrication process that produces high strain (13%), reliable (3480 cycles at maximum strain), and stiff (157 N/m) actuators. An axisymmetric finite element method (FEM) model with electrostatic and radial bulk modulus nonlinearity predicts actuator displacement and stress. The maximum compressive radial stress occurs at the center of the innermost active layer. This layer also has the thinnest material, indicating the most likely failure point. The nonlinear model predicts actuator displacement in response to applied voltage and load, and matches experiments to within 1 mm.",
