        "abstract": "With the widespread adoption of the Internet and mobile Internet, an increasing number of individuals are expressing their emotions on short-video platforms. Contemporary multimodal emotion analysis technologies facilitate a more comprehensive recognition and understanding of emotions through the analysis of various data sources including text, facial expressions, audio, hand gestures, among others. Consequently, the significance of sentiment analysis is becoming increasingly pronounced. However, existing research indicates that most emotion analysis techniques are not sufficiently rapid and efficient in light of the exponential proliferation of short video content. In addition, most sentiment analysis models demonstrate significant differences in the contribution of each modality, with text and visual modalities often exerting a greater influence than audio modes. Furthermore, in the pursuit of heightened accuracy, certain models are designed to be exceedingly complex, while others prioritize swift reasoning at the expense of accuracy. This paper proposes a more efficient multimodal sentiment analysis model, presenting three distinct advantages. Firstly, residual-free connectivity modules capable of extracting 3-D attentional weights are proposed to process visual modal features, maintaining accuracy while improving inference efficiency. Secondly, adoption of multi-scale hierarchical context aggregation (aggregation followed by interaction) for audio modality to capture coarse- and fine-grained audio contextual information through multilevel aggregation, thereby enriching audio modality features and minimizing disparities between modalities\u2019 contributions. Finally, attainment of a superior balance between accuracy and speed, thereby enhancing adaptability to the fast-paced short video environment and meeting the burgeoning demand for video content processing.",

        "abstract": "Automatic license plate recognition is applied widely in life, but it is still a challenging task in open scenarios. The current ALPR methods require multiple recognitions in multi-license plate scenarios. Furthermore, they have complex recognition structures and insufficient recognition capabilities for multi-style license plates. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a single-stage multi-style multi-license plate recognition method based on the attention mechanism: CLPRNet. We use a spatial attention module based on UNet to separate the license plate character sequence into each attention heatmap in order. This approach unifies license plates with different character lengths and different character rows into a single processing logic, thereby enabling CLPRNet to recognize multiple styles without additional style judgement branches. At the same time, we abandon the traditional method of cropping RoI from image or feature, and instead combine attention to recognize characters directly, which allows CLPRNet to recognize multiple license plates in a single pass. To address the issue of an inadequate number of multi-style license plate samples, this paper also proposes a multi-style license plate generation method. In the single-stage methods, CLPRNet demonstrates better detection performance on the CCPD dataset and better recognition performance on the FN, Rotate, and Tilt subsets of the CCPD dataset. Compared with the existing license plate recognition methods, CLPRNet can recognize more styles of license plates. Test results and ablation experiments have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

From the cloud-client discrepancy on the range of image classes, the recognition model is desired to have strong adaptiveness, intuitively by focusing on each client\u2019s local dynamic class subset, while incurring negligible overhead. In this work, we propose to plug a new intra-client and inter-image attention (ICIIA) module into existing backbone recognition models, requiring only one-time cloud-based training to be client-adaptive. In particular, given an image to be recognized from a certain client, ICIIA introduces multi-head self-attention to retrieve relevant images from the client\u2019s local images, thereby calibrating the focus and the recognition result. We further identify the bottleneck of ICIIA\u2019s overhead being in linear projection, propose to group and shuffle the features before the projections, and allow increasing the number of feature groups to dramatically improve efficiency without scarifying much accuracy. We extensively evaluate ICIIA and compare its performance against several baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, for a partitioned version of ImageNet-1K with the backbone models of MobileNetV3-L and Swin-B, ICIIA improves the classification accuracy to 83.37% (+8.11%) and 88.86% (+5.28%), while adding only 1.62% and 0.02% of FLOPs, respectively.

However, we found that the synthetic datasets degrade classification performance over real datasets when using the same dataset size. This means that the synthetic samples from modern diffusion models are less informative for training discriminative tasks. This paper investigates the gap between synthetic and real samples by analyzing the synthetic samples reconstructed from real samples through the noising (diffusion) and denoising (reverse) process of diffusion models. By varying the time steps starting the reverse process in the reconstruction, we can control the trade-off between the information in the original real data and the information produced by diffusion models.

However, the application of GNNs in this domain encounters significant challenges, primarily due to class imbalance and a mixture of homophily and heterophily of fraud graphs. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose LACA, which implements fraud detection on graphs using Label-Aware feature aggregation to advance GNN training, which is regularized by Clustering Augmented optimization. Specifically, label-aware feature aggregation simplifies adaptive aggregation in homophily-heterophily mixed neighborhoods, preventing gradient domination by legitimate nodes and mitigating class imbalance in message passing. Clustering-augmented optimization provides fine-grained subclass semantics to improve detection performance, and yields additional benefit in addressing class imbalance.

The reason is that users with various privacy preferences may selectively publish their sensitive attributes and only limited sensitive attributes can be collected. Besides, the users who publish sensitive attributes still face privacy risks. In this paper, we first consider the situation in which the sensitive attributes are limited and propose a framework called PCFGR (Partially observed sensitive Attributes in Counterfactual Fair Graph Representation Learning) to learn fair graph representation from limited sensitive attributes.

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of diffusion models and flow-based generative models, there has been a surge of interests in solving noisy linear inverse problems, e.g., super-resolution, deblurring, denoising, colorization, etc, with generative models. However, while remarkable reconstruction performances have been achieved, their inference time is typically too slow since most of them rely on the seminal diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) framework and thus to approximate the intractable likelihood score, time-consuming gradient calculation through back-propagation is needed. To address this issue, this paper provides a fast and effective solution by proposing a simple closed-form approximation to the likelihood score.

However, while remarkable reconstruction performances have been achieved, their inference time is typically too slow since most of them rely on the seminal diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) framework and thus to approximate the intractable likelihood score, time-consuming gradient calculation through back-propagation is needed. To address this issue, this paper provides a fast and effective solution by proposing a simple closed-form approximation to the likelihood score. For both diffusion and flow-based models, extensive experiments are conducted on various noisy linear inverse problems such as noisy super-resolution, denoising, deblurring, and colorization.

Most of adversarial examples generated by introducing adversarial perturbations within the $l_p$ norm bounds to benign audio inputs.

To improve the acoustic realism of adversarial examples and enhance attack performance, we propose a novel attack framework called Diffusion-based Adversarial Attack, leveraging DiffVC, a diffusion-based voice conversion model, to map audio to a latent space and employing Adversarial Latent Perturbation (ALP) to embed less perceptible and more robust perturbations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method enhances targeted attack performance. Notably, the Word Error Rate (WER) has shown an average increase of 101 absolute points over clean speech audio and 25 absolute points over C&W attack.

To alleviate the issue, we propose to utilize LLMs as the backbone of TQA tasks. To this end, we utilize two methods, the raw-context based prompting method and the knowledge graph based prompting method.

        "abstract": "Federated graph learning enhances federated learning by enabling privacy-preserving collaborative training on distributed graph data. While traditional methods are effective in managing data heterogeneity, they typically assume static graph structures, overlooking the dynamic nature of real-world graphs. Integrating federated graph learning with dynamic graph neural networks addresses this issue but often fails to retain previously acquired knowledge, limiting generalization for both global and personalized models. This paper proposes FedDGL, a novel framework designed to address temporal evolution , and data heterogeneity in federated dynamic graph learning. Unlike conventional approaches, FedDGL captures temporal dynamics through a global knowledge distillation technique and manages client heterogeneity using a global prototype-based regularization method. The framework employs contrastive learning to generate global prototypes, enhancing feature representation while utilizing a prototype similarity-based personalized aggregation strategy for effective adaptation to local and global data distributions.

While traditional methods are effective in managing data heterogeneity, they typically assume static graph structures, overlooking the dynamic nature of real-world graphs. Integrating federated graph learning with dynamic graph neural networks addresses this issue but often fails to retain previously acquired knowledge, limiting generalization for both global and personalized models. This paper proposes FedDGL, a novel framework designed to address temporal evolution , and data heterogeneity in federated dynamic graph learning. Unlike conventional approaches, FedDGL captures temporal dynamics through a global knowledge distillation technique and manages client heterogeneity using a global prototype-based regularization method. The framework employs contrastive learning to generate global prototypes, enhancing feature representation while utilizing a prototype similarity-based personalized aggregation strategy for effective adaptation to local and global data distributions. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that FedDGL achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with up to 9.02% and 8.77% gains in local and global testing, respectively, compared to FedAvg.

HiRAG employs state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented generation technologies to produce relevant background summarization. We implement a multi-strategy similarity calculation and introduce a sliding window mechanism to optimize retrieval construction. Our framework has been rigorously tested through a series of experiments and extensive analyses of the latest datasets. The promising results affirm the effectiveness of our proposed HiRAG framework and its retrieval capabilities.}\n}",

        "abstract": "Understanding the meaning of infant cries is a significant challenge for young parents in caring for their newborns. The presence of background noise and the lack of labeled data present practical challenges in developing systems that can detect crying and analyze its underlying reasons. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven framework, \u201cInfantCryNet,\u201d for accomplishing these tasks. To address the issue of data scarcity, we employ pre-trained audio models to incorporate prior knowledge into our model. We propose the use of statistical pooling and multi-head attention pooling techniques to extract features more effectively.

        "abstract": "Context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) is a complex and significant task that requires perceiving emotions from various contextual cues. Previous approaches primarily focus on designing sophisticated architectures to extract emotional cues from images. However, their knowledge is confined to specific training datasets and may reflect the subjective emotional biases of the annotators. Furthermore, acquiring large amounts of labeled data is often challenging in real-world applications. In this paper, we systematically explore the potential of leveraging Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to empower the CAER task from three paradigms: 1) We fine-tune LVLMs on two CAER datasets, which is the most common way to transfer large models to downstream tasks. 2) We design zero-shot and few-shot patterns to evaluate the performance of LVLMs in scenarios with limited data or even completely unseen. In this case, a training-free framework is proposed to fully exploit the In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities of LVLMs. Specifically, we develop an image similarity-based ranking algorithm to retrieve examples; subsequently, the instructions, retrieved examples, and the test example are combined to feed  LVLMs to obtain the corresponding sentiment judgment. 3) To leverage the rich knowledge base of LVLMs, we incorporate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) into our framework to enhance the model\u2019s reasoning ability and provide interpretable results. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that LVLMs achieve competitive performance in the CAER task across different paradigms.

Previous approaches primarily focus on designing sophisticated architectures to extract emotional cues from images. However, their knowledge is confined to specific training datasets and may reflect the subjective emotional biases of the annotators. Furthermore, acquiring large amounts of labeled data is often challenging in real-world applications. In this paper, we systematically explore the potential of leveraging Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to empower the CAER task from three paradigms: 1) We fine-tune LVLMs on two CAER datasets, which is the most common way to transfer large models to downstream tasks. 2) We design zero-shot and few-shot patterns to evaluate the performance of LVLMs in scenarios with limited data or even completely unseen. In this case, a training-free framework is proposed to fully exploit the In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities of LVLMs. Specifically, we develop an image similarity-based ranking algorithm to retrieve examples; subsequently, the instructions, retrieved examples, and the test example are combined to feed  LVLMs to obtain the corresponding sentiment judgment. 3) To leverage the rich knowledge base of LVLMs, we incorporate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) into our framework to enhance the model\u2019s reasoning ability and provide interpretable results. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that LVLMs achieve competitive performance in the CAER task across different paradigms. Notably, the superior performance in few-shot settings indicates the feasibility of LVLMs for accomplishing specific tasks without extensive training.}\n}",

Traditional methods for extracting motion, used in tasks such as action recognition, often rely on visual contents rather than precise motion features. This phenomenon is referred to as \u2019blind motion extraction\u2019 behavior, which proves inefficient in capturing motions of interest due to a lack of motion-guided cues. Recently, attention mechanisms have enhanced many computer vision tasks by effectively highlighting salient visual areas. Inspired by this, we propose a modified Sigmoid function with learnable slope and shift parameters as an attention mechanism to modulate motion signals from frame differencing maps. This approach generates a sequence of attention maps that enhance the processing of motion-related video content. To ensure temporal continuity and smoothness of the attention maps, we apply pair-wise temporal attention variation regularization to remove unwanted motions (e.g., noise) while preserving important ones. We then perform Hadamard product between each pair of attention maps and the original video frames to highlight the evolving motions of interest over time. These highlighted motions, termed video motion prompts, are subsequently used as inputs to the model instead of the original video frames. We formalize this process as a motion prompt layer and incorporate the regularization term into the loss function to learn better motion prompts. This layer serves as an adapter between the model and the video data, bridging the gap between traditional \u2019blind motion extraction\u2019 and the extraction of relevant motions of interest.

Moreover, the locality of temporal features requires the model to focus on certain key features. Yet, most methods overlook the impact of temporal redundancy on feature focus, resulting in ineffective capture of significant temporal features. To address the issue of skeleton sparsity, we propose a Multilevel Position-aware Attention module (MPA) that explicitly leverages the relative positional information of the input data to enrich spatial information. To achieve a more effective focus on local temporal features, we develop a Multi-scale Temporal Excitation module (MTE). By scaling temporal features, the MTE module elevates the prominence of salient features and facilitates the capture of multi-scale features. Furthermore, we propose a Part Partition Encoding module (PPE) to aggregate joint data into part data, thereby providing the model with high-level information carried by the interactions between body parts.

        "abstract": "The goal of Synthetic Speech Detection (SSD) is to detect spoofing speech synthesized by text-to-speech and voice conversion. Most existing SSD methods focus only on mining frequency-wise dependency by customizing frequency-aggregation modules in SSD models. However, the instance-wise dependency is usually under-explored, which is critical for identifying the synthetic speech in a global view. In this paper, we propose a novel model-agnostic training strategy for SSD that exploits both local (frequency-wise) and global (instance-wise) contexts, which do not rely on a customized architecture and can be flexibly integrated into previous SSD models. Specifically, we propose an inter-frequency correlation module to capture the local context by reconstructing the masked frequency information from the unmasked frequency context. Meanwhile, an inter-instance correlation module is performed to explore the global context among different instances by promoting intra-class compactness and inter-class dispersion in the latent space. These two complementary modules operate from distinct contextual perspectives, leading to improvements in SSD performance. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves the performance of two state-of-the-art models on the 2019 dataset and 2021 dataset of ASVspoof.",

Many current 3D scene generation methods rely on pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models and monocular depth estimators, but they often lack rich geometric constraint information within the scene, leading to geometric distortion in the generated results. Therefore, we propose a two-stage geometry-aware progressive scene generation framework, SceneWeaver, which creates diverse, high-quality 3D scenes from text or image inputs. In the first stage, we introduce a multi-level depth refinement mechanism combined with image inpainting and point cloud updating strategies to construct a high-quality initial point cloud. In the second stage, 3D Gaussians are initialized based on the point cloud and continuously optimized. To address the challenge of insufficient geometric constraints in the Gaussian Splatting optimization process, we utilize the rich appearance and geometry information within the scene to perform a geometry-aware optimization, resulting in high-quality scene generation results.

However, few existing works inspect label information in contrastive representation learning, especially for multi-modality ultrasound scenes. In this work, a two-stage supervised multi-modality contrastive representation classification network (TSMCR) is proposed for assisting breast cancer diagnosis on the multimodality ultrasound. TSMCR consists of two-stage supervised multimodality contrastive learning (SMCL) and deep support vector machine (DSVM). By a novel contrastive loss, SMCL  handles the consistency between modalities and the sample separability. Further, two-stage SMCL learns expressive representation by gradually pulling the similar samples of positive pairs closer and pushing the dissimilar samples of negative pairs apart in the projection space. Besides, on the fusion of the multi-level contrastive representation, DSVM is to jointly learn the representation network and classifier again in a unified framework to improve the generation performance.

Addressing the challenge of modal differences between visible and infrared images, we propose a VI-ReID network based on Feature Fusion and Deep Mutual Learning (DML). To enhance the model\u2019s robustness to color, we introduce a novel data augmentation method called Random Combination of Channels (RCC), which generates new images by randomly combining R, G, and B channels of visible images. Furthermore, to capture more informative features of individuals, we fuse the features from the middle layer of the network. To reduce the model\u2019s dependence on global features, we employ a fusion branch as an auxiliary branch, facilitating synchronous learning of global and fusion branches through Deep Mutual Learning .

Addressing the challenge of modal differences between visible and infrared images, we propose a VI-ReID network based on Feature Fusion and Deep Mutual Learning (DML). To enhance the model\u2019s robustness to color, we introduce a novel data augmentation method called Random Combination of Channels (RCC), which generates new images by randomly combining R, G, and B channels of visible images. Furthermore, to capture more informative features of individuals, we fuse the features from the middle layer of the network. To reduce the model\u2019s dependence on global features, we employ a fusion branch as an auxiliary branch, facilitating synchronous learning of global and fusion branches through Deep Mutual Learning .

Despite their stunning performance, the huge pre-training cost is prohibitive. Progressive pre-training takes advantage of the faster convergence speed of small models to save computing overhead and shows great potential in accelerating pre-training. This work studies the two key issues in progressive pre-training: growth schedule and growth operation. First, we estimate the optimal growth point in theory. Then, we find in experiments that the growth operation can be performed after the model enters the convergence stage to achieve a high speed-up ratio. On the other hand, we propose progressive dimensionality growth for width expansion and redundant layers for depth expansion. Progressive dimensionality growth is a smoothed operation and improves training stability. Redundant layers implement function-preserving at a small cost and inherit the core parameters of adjacent layers, improving the utilization of knowledge learned by the original model. Our method follows strict function preservation and produces good training dynamics. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the baselines and achieves an acceleration rate of about 1.5 times while achieving the same training effect.",
