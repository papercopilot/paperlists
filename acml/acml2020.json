        "abstract": "Random forest is widely exploited as an ensemble learning method. In many practical applications, however, there is still a significant challenge to learn from imbalanced data. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a deep dynamic boosted forest (DDBF), a novel ensemble algorithm that incorporates the notion of hard example mining into random forest. Speci\ufb01cally, we propose to measure the quality of each leaf node of every decision tree in the random forest to determine hard examples. By iteratively training and then removing easy examples from training data, we evolve the random forest to focus on hard examples dynamically so as to balance the proportion of samples and learn decision boundaries better. Data can be cascaded through these random forests learned in each iteration in sequence to generate more accurate predictions.

In many practical applications, however, there is still a significant challenge to learn from imbalanced data. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a deep dynamic boosted forest (DDBF), a novel ensemble algorithm that incorporates the notion of hard example mining into random forest. Speci\ufb01cally, we propose to measure the quality of each leaf node of every decision tree in the random forest to determine hard examples. By iteratively training and then removing easy examples from training data, we evolve the random forest to focus on hard examples dynamically so as to balance the proportion of samples and learn decision boundaries better. Data can be cascaded through these random forests learned in each iteration in sequence to generate more accurate predictions. Our DDBF outperforms random forest on 5 UCI datasets, MNIST and SATIMAGE, and achieved state-of-the-art results compared to other deep models.

        "abstract": "Topic models are widely used for extracting latent features from documents. Conventional count-based models like LDA focus on co-occurrence of words, neglecting features like semantics and lexical relations in the corpora. To overcome this drawback, many knowledge-enhanced models are proposed, attempting to achieve better topic coherence with external knowledge. In this paper, we present novel probabilistic topic models utilizing both explicit and implicit knowledge forms. Knowledge of real-world entities in a knowledge base/graph are referred to as explicit knowledge. We incorporate this knowledge form into our models by entity linking, a technique for bridging the gap between corpora and knowledge bases. This helps solving the problem of token/phrase-level synonymy and polysemy. Apart from explicit knowledge, we utilize latent feature word representations (implicit knowledge) to further capture lexical relations in pretraining corpora.

Conventional count-based models like LDA focus on co-occurrence of words, neglecting features like semantics and lexical relations in the corpora. To overcome this drawback, many knowledge-enhanced models are proposed, attempting to achieve better topic coherence with external knowledge. In this paper, we present novel probabilistic topic models utilizing both explicit and implicit knowledge forms. Knowledge of real-world entities in a knowledge base/graph are referred to as explicit knowledge. We incorporate this knowledge form into our models by entity linking, a technique for bridging the gap between corpora and knowledge bases. This helps solving the problem of token/phrase-level synonymy and polysemy. Apart from explicit knowledge, we utilize latent feature word representations (implicit knowledge) to further capture lexical relations in pretraining corpora. Qualitative and Quantitative evaluations are conducted on 2 datasets with 5 baselines (3 probabilistic models and 2 neural models). Our models exhibit high potential in generating coherent topics. Remarkably, when adopting both explicit and implicit knowledge, our proposed model even outperforms 2 state-of-the-art neural topic models, suggesting that knowledge-enhancement can highly improve the performance of conventional topic models. }\n}",

This paper proposes exact passive-aggressive online algorithms for multiclass classification under bandit feedback (EPABF). The proposed approach uses an exploration-exploitation strategy to guess the class label in every trial. To update the weights, we solve a quadratic optimization problem under multiple class separability constraints and find the exact solution.

These constraints form a support set that determines the classes for which the weight vector needs to be updated. We propose three different variants of the weight update rule, which vary based on the aggressiveness to correct the mistake. These are called EPABF, EPABF-I, and EPABF-II. We also provide mistake bounds for the proposed EPABF, EPABF-I, and EPABF-II.

Recently, filter pruning had been introduced as a promising model compression method to reduce computation cost and storage overhead. However, existing filter pruning approaches are mainly model-based, which rely on empirical model to evaluate the importance of filters and set parameters manually to guide model compression. In this paper, we observe that CNNs commonly consist of large amount of inactive filters, and introduce Filter Inactive RatE (FIRE), a novel metric to evaluate the importance of filters in a neural network. Based on FIRE, we develop a learning based filter pruning strategy called FIREPruning for fast model compression. It adopts a regression model to predict the FIRE value and uses a three stage pipeline (FIRE prediction, pruning, and fine-tuning) to compress the neural network efficiently. Extensive experiments based on widely-used CNN models and well-known datasets show that FIREPruning reduces overall computation cost up to 86.9% without sacrificing too much accuracy, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art model compression methods.",

Such approaches find TSP solutions of good quality but require additional procedures such as beam search and sampling to improve solutions and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

In this work, we propose to learn a local search heuristic based on 2-opt operators via deep reinforcement learning. We propose a policy gradient algorithm to learn a stochastic policy that selects 2-opt operations given a current solution.

        "abstract": "Hierarchical clustering has been shown to be valuable in many scenarios. Despite its usefulness to many situations, there is no agreed methodology on how to properly evaluate the hierarchies produced from different techniques, particularly in the case where ground-truth labels are unavailable. This motivates us to propose a framework for assessing the quality of hierarchical clustering allocations which covers the case of no ground-truth information.

Due to possibly extremely long runtimes of candidate algorithms, training data for algorithm selection models is usually generated under time constraints in the sense that not all algorithms are run to completion on all instances. Thus, training data usually comprises censored information, as the true runtime of algorithms timed out remains unknown. However, many standard AS approaches are not able to handle such information in a proper way. On the other side, survival  analysis (SA) naturally supports censored data and offers appropriate ways to use such data for learning distributional models of algorithm runtime, as we demonstrate in this work. We leverage such models as a basis of a sophisticated decision-theoretic approach to algorithm selection, which we dub Run2Survive. Moreover, taking advantage of a framework of this kind, we advocate a risk-averse approach to algorithm selection, in which the avoidance of a timeout is given high priority.

In this paper, we study Thompson Sampling based algorithm for Unsupervised Sequential Selection (USS) problem. The USS problem is a variant of the stochastic multi-armed bandits problem, where the loss of an arm can not be inferred from the observed feedback. In the USS setup, arms are associated with fixed costs and are ordered, forming a cascade. In each round, the learner selects an arm and observes the feedback from arms up to the selected arm. The learner\u2019s goal is to find the arm that minimizes the expected total loss. The total loss is the sum of the cost incurred for selecting the arm and the stochastic loss associated with the selected arm. The problem is challenging because, without knowing the mean loss, one cannot compute the total loss for the selected arm. Clearly, learning is feasible only if the optimal arm can be inferred from the problem structure. As shown in the prior work, learning is possible when the problem instance satisfies the so-called \u2018Weak Dominance\u2019 (WD) property. Under WD, we show that our Thompson Sampling based algorithm for the USS problem achieves near optimal regret and has better numerical performance than existing algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Currently it is well known that deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, constructed by applying small but malicious perturbations to the original inputs. Moreover, the perturbed inputs can transfer between different models: adversarial examples generated based on a specific model will often fool other unseen models with a significant success rate. This allows the adversary to leverage it to attack the deployed systems without any query, which could raise severe security issue particularly in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we empirically investigate two classes of factors that might influence the transferability of adversarial examples. One is about model-specific factors, including network architecture, model capacity and test accuracy. The other is the local smoothness of loss surface for generating adversarial examples. More importantly, relying on these findings on the transferability of adversarial examples, we propose a simple but effective strategy to improve the transferability, whose effectiveness is confirmed through extensive experiments on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets.",
