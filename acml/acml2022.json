        "abstract": "To provide intelligent and personalized models for\r clients, personalized federated learning (PFL)\r enables learning from data, identifying patterns,\r and making automated decisions in a\r privacy-preserving manner. PFL involves independent\r training for multiple clients with synchronous\r aggregation steps. However, the assumptions made by\r existing works are not realistic given the\r heterogeneity of clients. In particular, the volume\r and distribution of collected data vary in the\r training process, and the clients also vary in their\r available system configurations, which leads to vast\r heterogeneity in the system. To address these\r challenges, we present an \\textit{asynchronous}\r method (AsyPFL), where clients learn personalized\r models w.r.t. local data by making the most\r informative parameters less volatile. The central\r server aggregates model parameters\r asynchronously. In addition, we also reformulate PFL\r by unifying both synchronous and asynchronous\r updating schemes with an asynchrony-related\r parameter. Theoretically, we show that AsyPFL\u2019s\r convergence rate is state-of-the-art and provide\r guarantees of choosing key hyperparameters\r optimally.

In this paper, we\r propose the Citculant-interactive Transformer\r Network with dimension-aware fusion (CITN-DAF),\r which enables parallel computation of different\r modalities among different time steps and alleviates\r inter-modal temporal sensitivity while preserving\r intra-modal semantic order. By incorporating\r circulant matrices into the cross-modal attention\r mechanism, CITN-DAF is aimed to examine all\r conceivable interactions between vectors of\r different modalities. In addition, a dimension-aware\r fusion method is presented, which projects feature\r representations into different subspaces for an\r in-depth fusion. We evaluate CITN-DAF on three\r commonly used sentiment analysis benchmarks\r including CMU-MOSEI, CMU-MOSI and IEMOCAP. Extensive\r experimental results reveal that CITN-DAF is\r superior in cross-modal semantic interactions and\r outperforms the state-of-the-art multimodal\r methods.}\n}",

However,\r \\textit{ALE\u2019s approximation}, i.e.\u00a0the method for\r estimating ALE from the limited samples of the\r training set, faces two weaknesses. First, it does\r not scale well in cases where the input has high\r dimensionality, and, second, it is vulnerable to\r out-of-distribution (OOD) sampling when the training\r set is relatively small. In this paper, we propose a\r novel ALE approximation, called Differential\r Accumulated Local Effects (DALE), which can be used\r in cases where the ML model is differentiable and an\r auto-differentiable framework is accessible. Our\r proposal has significant computational advantages,\r making feature effect estimation applicable to\r high-dimensional Machine Learning scenarios with\r near-zero computational overhead. Furthermore, DALE\r does not create artificial points for calculating\r the feature effect, resolving misleading estimations\r due to OOD sampling. Finally, we formally prove\r that, under some hypotheses, DALE is an unbiased\r estimator of ALE and we present a method for\r quantifying the standard error of the\r explanation. Experiments using both synthetic and\r real datasets demonstrate the value of the proposed\r approach.",

To address these problems, we propose a\r novel embedding adaptation network with Transformer\r (EANT) for few-shot action\r recognition.

        "abstract": "Most existing trackers based on spatial-temporal\r regularized correlation filters exploit response map\r variation to adapt regularization terms to object\r appearance changes automatically. However, these\r trackers ignore the high uncertainty of the response\r map when the object is occluded or similar objects\r around, making them unable to learn reliable filters\r accurately. Furthermore, most correlation filters\r use linear interpolation directly to update the\r filter model at each frame, which may cause model\r degradation once the tracking result is inaccurate\r or missing. In this work, we propose a novel\r probabilistic adaptive spatial-temporal regularized\r correlation filters (PASTRCF) to solve the two\r issues mentioned above. A probabilistic model\r constructing the reliability of the response map is\r introduced to accurately utilize the information in\r the response map to learn regularization\r coefficients adaptively. The adaptive threshold\r mechanism provides an appropriate strategy to update\r the filter model to alleviate model\r degradation. Extensive experiments on UAV benchmarks\r have proven the favorable performance of our method\r compared to the state-of-art trackers, with robust\r tracking while ensuring real-time performance.",

This\r translates in the optimization of a trade-off\r between earliness and accuracy of the decisions,\r that has been the subject of research for time\r series of finite length and with a unique label. And\r this has led to powerful algorithms for Early\r Classification of Time Series (ECTS). This paper,\r for the first time, investigates such a trade-off\r when events of different classes occur in a\r streaming fashion, with no predefined end.  In the\r Early Classification in Open Time Series problem\r (ECOTS), the task is to predict events, i.e. their\r class and time interval, at the moment that\r optimizes the accuracy vs. earliness\r trade-off. Interestingly, we find that ECTS\r algorithms can be sensibly adapted in a principled\r way to this new problem.  We illustrate our\r methodology by transforming two state-of-the-art\r ECTS algorithms for the ECOTS scenario.Among the\r wide variety of applications that this new approach\r opens up, we develop here a predictive maintenance\r use case that optimizes alarm triggering times, thus\r demonstrating the power of this new approach.",
