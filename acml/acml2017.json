        "abstract": "The covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is an efficient derivative-free optimization algorithm. It optimizes a black-box objective function over a well defined parameter space. In some problems, such parameter spaces are defined using function approximation in which feature functions are manually defined. Therefore, the performance of those techniques strongly depends on the quality of chosen features. Hence, enabling CMA-ES to optimize on a more complex and general function class of the objective has long been desired. Specifically, we consider modeling the input space for black-box optimization in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). This modeling leads to a functional optimization problem whose domain is a function space that enables us to optimize in a very rich function class. In addition, we propose CMA-ES-RKHS, a generalized CMA-ES framework, that performs black-box functional optimization in RKHS. A search distribution, represented as a Gaussian process, is adapted by updating both its mean function and covariance operator. Adaptive representation of the mean function and the covariance operator is achieved by resorting to sparsification. CMA-ES-RKHS is evaluated on two simple functional optimization problems and two bench-mark reinforcement learning (RL) domains. For an application in RL, we model policies for MDPs in RKHS and transform a cumulative return objective as a functional of RKHS policies, which can be optimized via CMA-ES-RKHS. This formulation results in a black-box functional policy search framework.",

Path-based relation inference is one of the most important approaches to this task. Traditional methods treat each path between entity pairs as an atomic feature, thus inducing sparsity. Recently, neural network models solve this problem by decomposing a path as the sequence of relations in the path, before modelling path representations with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures. In cases there are multiple paths between an entity pair, state-of-the-art neural models either select only one path, or make usage of simple score pooling methods like Top-K, Average, LogSumExp.

In this paper, we propose a novel path-based relation inference model that learns entity pair representations with attentive path combination. Given an entity pair and a set of paths connecting the pair, our model allows for integrating information from each informative path, and form a dynamic entity pair representation for each query relation.

In this paper, we propose to apply a novel method, namely Hybrid Orthogonal Projection and Estimation (HOPE), to CNNs in order to introduce orthogonality into the CNN structure. The HOPE model can be viewed as a hybrid model to combine feature extraction using orthogonal linear projection with mixture models. It is an effective model to extract useful information from the original high-dimension feature vectors and meanwhile filter out irrelevant noises. In this work, we present three different ways to apply the HOPE models to CNNs, i.e., \\em HOPE-Input, \\em single-HOPE-Block and \\em multi-HOPE-Blocks. For \\em HOPE-Input CNNs, a HOPE layer is directly used right after the input to de-correlate high-dimension input feature vectors. Alternatively, in \\em single-HOPE-Block and \\em multi-HOPE-Blocks CNNs, we consider to use HOPE layers to replace one or more blocks in the CNNs, where one block may include several convolutional layers and one pooling layer. The experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet databases have shown that the orthogonal constraints imposed by the HOPE layers can significantly improve the performance of CNNs in these image classification tasks (we have achieved one of the best performance when image augmentation has not been applied, and top 5 performance with image augmentation).",

        "abstract": "End-to-end learning refers to training a possibly complex learning system by applying gradient-based learning to the system as a whole. End-to-end learning systems are specifically designed so that all modules are differentiable. In effect, not only a central learning machine, but also all \u201cperipheral\u201d modules like representation learning and memory formation are covered by a holistic learning process. The power of end-to-end learning has been demonstrated on many tasks, like playing a whole array of Atari video games with a single architecture. While pushing for solutions to more challenging tasks, network architectures keep growing more and more complex.\r In this paper we ask the question whether and to what extent end-to-end learning is a future-proof technique in the sense of \\emphscaling to complex and diverse data processing architectures.

From lengthening battery life of mobile devices to reducing the energy bill of a datacenter, it is important to understand the energy efficiency of CNNs during serving for making an inference, before actually training the model. In this work, we propose NeuralPower: a layer-wise predictive framework based on sparse polynomial regression, for predicting the serving energy consumption of a CNN deployed on any GPU platform. Given the architecture of a CNN, NeuralPower provides an accurate prediction and breakdown for power and runtime across all layers in the whole network, helping machine learners quickly identify the power, runtime, or energy bottlenecks. We also propose the \u201cenergy-precision ratio\u201d (EPR) metric to guide machine learners in selecting an energy-efficient CNN architecture that better trades off the energy consumption and prediction accuracy. The experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of the proposed NeuralPower outperforms the best published model to date, yielding an improvement in accuracy of up to 68.5%. We also assess the accuracy of predictions at the network level, by predicting the runtime, power, and energy of state-of-the-art CNN architectures, achieving an average accuracy of 88.24% in runtime, 88.34% in power, and 97.21% in energy.

        "abstract": "Bayesian optimization (BO) is a sample-efficient method for global optimization of expensive, noisy, black-box functions using probabilistic methods. The performance of a BO method depends on its selection strategy through the acquisition function. Expected improvement (EI) is one of the most widely used acquisition functions for BO that finds the expectation of the improvement function over the incumbent. The incumbent is usually selected as the best-observed value so far, termed as $y^\\max$ (for the maximizing problem). Recent work has studied the convergence rate for EI under some mild assumptions or zero noise of observations. Especially, the work of Wang and de Freitas (2014) has derived the sublinear regret for EI under a stochastic noise. However, due to the difficulty in stochastic noise setting and to make the convergent proof feasible, they use an alternative choice for the incumbent as the maximum of the Gaussian process predictive mean, $\u03bc^\\max$. This modification makes the algorithm computationally inefficient because it requires an additional global optimization step to estimate $\u03bc^\\max$ that is costly and may be inaccurate. To address this issue, we derive a sublinear convergence rate for EI using the commonly used $y^\\max$. Moreover, our analysis is the first to study a stopping criteria for EI to prevent unnecessary evaluations. Our analysis complements the results of Wang and de Freitas (2014) to theoretically cover two incumbent settings for EI. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that EI using $y^\\max$ is both more computationally efficiency and more accurate than EI using $\u03bc^\\max$.",

        "abstract": "\\emphNon-Gaussian component analysis (NGCA) is an unsupervised linear dimension reduction method that extracts low-dimensional non-Gaussian \u201csignals\u201d from high-dimensional data contaminated with Gaussian noise. NGCA can be regarded as a generalization of \\emphprojection pursuit (PP) and \\emphindependent component analysis (ICA) to multi-dimensional and dependent non-Gaussian components. Indeed, seminal approaches to NGCA are based on PP and ICA. Recently, a novel NGCA approach called \\emphleast-squares NGCA (LSNGCA) has been developed, which gives a solution analytically through least-squares estimation of \\emphlog-density gradients and eigendecomposition. However, since \\emphpre-whitening of data is involved in LSNGCA, it performs unreliably when the data covariance matrix is ill-conditioned, which is often the case in high-dimensional data analysis. In this paper, we propose a \\emphwhitening-free variant of LSNGCA and experimentally demonstrate its superiority.",
