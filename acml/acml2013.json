        "abstract": "Bipartite ranking is a fundamental ranking problem that learns to order relevant instances ahead of irrelevant ones. One major approach for bipartite ranking, called the pair-wise approach, tackles an equivalent binary classification problem of whether one instance out of a pair of instances should be ranked higher than the other. Nevertheless, the number of instance pairs constructed from the input data could be quadratic to the size of the input data, which makes pair-wise ranking generally infeasible on large-scale data sets. Another major approach for bipartite ranking, called the point-wise approach, directly solves a binary classification problem between relevant and irrelevant instance points. This approach is feasible for large-scale data sets, but the resulting ranking performance can be inferior. That is, it is difficult to conduct bipartite ranking accurately and efficiently at the same time. In this paper, we develop a novel scheme within the pair-wise approach to conduct bipartite ranking efficiently. The scheme, called Active Sampling, is inspired from the rich field of active learning and can reach a competitive ranking performance while focusing only on a small subset of the many pairs during training. Moreover, we propose a general Combined Ranking and Classification (CRC) framework to accurately conduct bipartite ranking. The framework unifies point-wise and pair-wise approaches and is simply based on the idea of treating each instance point as a pseudo-pair. Experiments on 14 real- word large-scale data sets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm of Active Sampling within CRC, when coupled with a linear Support Vector Machine, usually outperforms state-of-the-art point-wise and pair-wise ranking approaches in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning algorithms are usually hard to use for non expert users. It is required to consider several aspects like the definition of state-, action- and reward-space as well as the algorithms hyperparameters. Preference based approaches try to address these problems by omitting the requirement for exact rewards, replacing them with preferences over solutions. Some algorithms have been proposed within this framework, but they are usually requiring parameterized policies which is again a hinderance for their application. Monte Carlo based approaches do not have this restriction and are also model free. Hence, we present a new preference-based reinforcement learning algorithm, utilizing Monte Carlo estimates. The main idea is to estimate the relative Q-value of two actions for the same state within a every-visit framework. This means, preferences are used to estimate the Q-value of state-action pairs within a trajectory, based on the feedback concerning the complete trajectory. The algorithm is evaluated on three common benchmark problems, namely mountain car, inverted pendulum and acrobot, showing its advantage over a closely related algorithm which is also using estimates for intermediate states, but based on a probability theorem. In comparison to SARSA(\u03bb), EPMC converges somewhat slower, but computes policies that are almost as good or better.",

        "abstract": "The problem of multi-label classification has attracted great interests in the last decade. Multi-label classification refers to the problems where an example that is represented by a \\emphsingle instance can be assigned to \\emphmore than one category. Until now, most of the researches on multi-label classification have focused on supervised settings whose assumption is that large amount of labeled training data is available. Unfortunately, labeling training example is expensive and time-consuming, especially when it has more than one label. However, in many cases abundant unlabeled data is easy to obtain. Current attempts toward exploiting unlabeled data for multi-label classification work under the \\emphtransductive setting, which aim at making predictions on existing unlabeled data while can not generalize to new unseen data. In this paper, the problem of \\emphinductive semi-supervised multi-label classification is studied, where a new approach named \\textsliMLCU, i.e. \\emphinductive Multi-Label Classification with Unlabeled data, is proposed.

Multi-label classification refers to the problems where an example that is represented by a \\emphsingle instance can be assigned to \\emphmore than one category. Until now, most of the researches on multi-label classification have focused on supervised settings whose assumption is that large amount of labeled training data is available. Unfortunately, labeling training example is expensive and time-consuming, especially when it has more than one label. However, in many cases abundant unlabeled data is easy to obtain. Current attempts toward exploiting unlabeled data for multi-label classification work under the \\emphtransductive setting, which aim at making predictions on existing unlabeled data while can not generalize to new unseen data. In this paper, the problem of \\emphinductive semi-supervised multi-label classification is studied, where a new approach named \\textsliMLCU, i.e. \\emphinductive Multi-Label Classification with Unlabeled data, is proposed. We formulate the inductive semi-supervised multi-label learning as an optimization problem of learning linear models and ConCave Convex Procedure \\textsl(CCCP) is applied to optimize the non-convex optimization problem. Empirical studies on twelve diversified real-word multi-label learning tasks clearly validate the superiority of \\textsliMLCU against the other well-established multi-label learning approaches.}\n}",

We do this in a natural manner by adding \\ell_0 regularisation to the pathwise squared Q-learning objective function and then optimise this over both a choice of map from history to states and the resulting MDP parameters. The optimisation procedure involves a stochastic search over the map class nested with classical Q-learning of the parameters. This algorithm fits perfectly into the feature reinforcement learning framework, which chooses maps based on a cost criteria. The cost criterion used so far for feature reinforcement learning has been model-based and aimed at predicting future states and rewards. Instead we directly predict the return, which is what is needed for choosing optimal actions. Our Q-learning criteria also lends itself immediately to a function approximation setting where features are chosen based on the history. This algorithm is somewhat similar to the recent line of work on lasso temporal difference learning which aims at finding a small feature set with which one can perform policy evaluation. The distinction is that we aim directly for learning the Q-function of the optimal policy and we use \\ell_0 instead of \\ell_1 regularisation. We perform an experimental evaluation on classical benchmark domains and find improvement in convergence speed as well as in economy of the state representation. We also compare against MC-AIXI on the large Pocman domain and achieve competitive performance in average reward. We use less than half the CPU time and 36 times less memory.

Traditional CF algorithms are often based on batch machine learning methods which suffer from several critical drawbacks, e.g., extremely expensive model retraining cost whenever new samples arrive, unable to capture the latest change of user preferences over time, and high cost and slow reaction to new users or products extension. Such limitations make batch learning based CF methods unsuitable for real-world online applications where data often arrives sequentially and user preferences may change dynamically and rapidly. To address these limitations, we investigate online collaborative filtering techniques for building live recommender systems where the CF model can evolve on-the-fly over time. Unlike the regular first order CF algorithms (e.g., online gradient descent for CF) that converge slowly, in this paper, we present a new framework of second order online collaborative filtering, i.e., Confidence Weighted Online Collaborative Filtering (CWOCF), which applies the second order online optimization methodology to tackle the online collaborative filtering task. We conduct extensive experiments on several large-scale datasets, in which the encouraging results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms obtain significantly lower errors (both RMSE and MAE) than the state-of-the-art first order CF algorithms when receiving the same amount of training data in the online learning process.",

Unlike the regular first order CF algorithms (e.g., online gradient descent for CF) that converge slowly, in this paper, we present a new framework of second order online collaborative filtering, i.e., Confidence Weighted Online Collaborative Filtering (CWOCF), which applies the second order online optimization methodology to tackle the online collaborative filtering task. We conduct extensive experiments on several large-scale datasets, in which the encouraging results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms obtain significantly lower errors (both RMSE and MAE) than the state-of-the-art first order CF algorithms when receiving the same amount of training data in the online learning process.}\n}",
