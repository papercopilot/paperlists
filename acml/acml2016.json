        "abstract": "Many real-world applications require multi-label classification where multiple target labels are assigned to each instance. In multi-label classification, there exist the intrinsic correlations between the labels and features. These correlations are beneficial for multi-label classification task since they reflect the coexistence of the input and output spaces that can be exploited for prediction. Traditional classification methods have attempted to reveal these correlations in different ways. However, existing methods demand expensive computation complexity for finding such correlation structures. Furthermore, these approaches can not identify the suitable number of label-feature correlation patterns. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) framework for multi-label classification that can automatically learn and exploit the unknown number of multi-label correlation. We utilize the recent techniques in stochastic inference to derive the cheap (but efficient) posterior inference algorithm for the model. In addition, our model can naturally exploit the useful information from missing label samples. Furthermore, we extend the model to update parameters in an online fashion that highlights the flexibility of our model against the existing approaches. We compare our method with the state-of-the-art multi-label classification algorithms on real-world datasets using both complete and missing label settings. Our model achieves better classification accuracy while our running time is consistently much faster than the baselines in an order of magnitude.",

Recently, word graph-based approaches have been proposed and become popular in MSC. Their key assumption is that redundancy among a set of related sentences provides a reliable way to generate informative and grammatical sentences. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to enhance the word graph-based MSC and tackle the issue that most of the state-of-the-art MSC approaches are confronted with: i.e., improving both informativity and grammaticality at the same time. Our approach consists of three main components: (1) a merging method based on Multiword Expressions (MWE); (2) a mapping strategy based on synonymy between words; (3) a re-ranking step to identify the best compression candidates generated using a POS-based language model (POS-LM). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel approach using a dataset made of clusters of English newswire sentences. The observed improvements on informativity and grammaticality of the generated compressions show an up to 44% error reduction over state-of-the-art MSC systems.",

        "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are seen to be extremely effective in many large object recognition tasks. One of the reasons for this is that they learn appropriate features also from the training data. The convolutional layers of a CNN have these feature generating filters whose weights are learnt. However, this entails learning millions of weights (across different layers) and hence learning times are very large even on the best available hardware. In some studies in transfer learning it has been observed that the network learnt on one task can be reused on another task (by some finetuning). In this context, this paper presents a systematic study of the exchangeability of weight filters of CNNs across different object recognition tasks. The paper proposes the concept of bank of weight-filters (BWF) which consists of all the weight vectors of filters learnt by different CNNs on different tasks. The BWF can be viewed at multiple levels of granularity such as network-level, layer-level and filter-level. Through extensive empirical investigations we show that one can efficiently learn CNNs for new tasks by randomly selecting from the bank of filters for initializing the convolutional layers of the new CNN. Our study is done at all the multiple levels of granularity mentioned above. Our results show that the concept of BWF proposed here would offer a very good strategy for initializing the filters while learning CNNs. We also show that the dependency among the filters and the layers of the CNN is not strict. One can choose any pre-trained filter instead of a fixed pre-trained net, as a whole, for initialization. This paper is a first step in the direction of creating and characterizing a Universal BWF for efficient learning of CNNs.",

In this work we advocate studying this ubiquitous form of data and, by combining ideas from latent factor models for collaborative filtering and language modeling, propose a novel, flexible and expressive collaborative sequence model based on recurrent neural networks.

        "abstract": "This paper explores the possibility of using multiplicative gates to build two recurrent neural network structures. These two structures are called Deep Simple Gated Unit (DSGU) and Simple Gated Unit (SGU), which are structures for learning long-term dependencies. Compared to traditional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), both structures require fewer parameters and less computation time in sequence classification tasks. Unlike GRU and LSTM, which require more than one gate to control information flow in the network, SGU and DSGU only use one multiplicative gate to control the flow of information.

Compared to traditional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), both structures require fewer parameters and less computation time in sequence classification tasks. Unlike GRU and LSTM, which require more than one gate to control information flow in the network, SGU and DSGU only use one multiplicative gate to control the flow of information.

While decision trees are powerful and easy-to-deploy approaches for accurate and fast learning from data streams, they are unable to capture the strong temporal dependences typically present in the input data. Recurrent Neural Networks are an alternative solution that include an internal memory to capture these temporal dependences; however their training is computationally very expensive and with slow convergence, requiring a large number of hyper-parameters to tune. Reservoir Computing was proposed to reduce the computation requirements of the training phase but still include a feed-forward layer which requires a large number of parameters to tune.

        "abstract": "The generalization ability of minimizers of the empirical risk in the context of binary classification has been investigated under a wide variety of complexity assumptions for the collection of classifiers over which optimization is performed. In contrast, the vast majority of the works dedicated to this issue stipulate that the training dataset used to compute the empirical risk functional is composed of i.i.d. observations and involve sharp control of uniform deviation of i.i.d. averages from their expectation. Beyond the cases where training data are drawn uniformly without replacement among a large i.i.d. sample or modelled as a realization of a weakly dependent sequence of r.v.\u2019s, statistical guarantees when the data used to train a classifier are drawn by means of a more general sampling/survey scheme and exhibit a complex dependence structure have not been documented in the literature yet. It is the main purpose of this paper to show that the theory of empirical risk minimization can   be extended to situations where statistical learning is based on survey samples and knowledge of the related (first order) inclusion probabilities. Precisely, we prove that minimizing a (possibly biased) weighted version of the empirical risk, refered to as the (approximate) Horvitz-Thompson risk (HT risk), over a class of controlled complexity lead to a rate for the excess risk of the order O_\\mathbbP((\\kappa_N (\\log N)/n)^1/2) with \\kappa_N=(n/N)/\\min_i\u2264N\\pi_i, when data are sampled by means of a rejective scheme of (deterministic) size n within a statistical population of cardinality N\u2265n, a generalization of basic \\it sampling without replacement with unequal probability weights \\pi_i > 0.

In contrast, the vast majority of the works dedicated to this issue stipulate that the training dataset used to compute the empirical risk functional is composed of i.i.d. observations and involve sharp control of uniform deviation of i.i.d. averages from their expectation. Beyond the cases where training data are drawn uniformly without replacement among a large i.i.d. sample or modelled as a realization of a weakly dependent sequence of r.v.\u2019s, statistical guarantees when the data used to train a classifier are drawn by means of a more general sampling/survey scheme and exhibit a complex dependence structure have not been documented in the literature yet. It is the main purpose of this paper to show that the theory of empirical risk minimization can   be extended to situations where statistical learning is based on survey samples and knowledge of the related (first order) inclusion probabilities. Precisely, we prove that minimizing a (possibly biased) weighted version of the empirical risk, refered to as the (approximate) Horvitz-Thompson risk (HT risk), over a class of controlled complexity lead to a rate for the excess risk of the order O_\\mathbbP((\\kappa_N (\\log N)/n)^1/2) with \\kappa_N=(n/N)/\\min_i\u2264N\\pi_i, when data are sampled by means of a rejective scheme of (deterministic) size n within a statistical population of cardinality N\u2265n, a generalization of basic \\it sampling without replacement with unequal probability weights \\pi_i > 0. Extension to other sampling schemes are then established by a coupling argument. Beyond theoretical results, numerical experiments are displayed in order to show the relevance of HT risk minimization and that ignoring the sampling scheme used to generate the training dataset may completely jeopardize the learning procedure.}\n}",

In this paper, we are interested in ICA in the presence of noise, i.e., the noisy ICA problem. Pseudo-Euclidean Gradient Iteration (PEGI) is a recent cumulant-based method that defines a pseudo Euclidean inner product to replace a quasi-whitening step in Gaussian noise invariant ICA. However, PEGI has two major limitations: 1) the pseudo Euclidean inner product is improper because it violates the positive definiteness of inner product; 2) the inner product matrix is orthogonal by design but it has gross errors or imperfections due to sample-based estimation. This paper proposes a new cumulant-based ICA method named as PIMD to address these two problems. We first define a Proper Inner product (PI) with proved positive definiteness and then relax the centering preprocessing step to a mean displacement (MD) step. Both PI and MD aim to improve the orthogonality of inner product matrix and the recovery of independent components (ICs) in sample-based estimation. We adopt a gradient iteration step to find the ICs for PIMD. Experiments on both synthetic and real data show the respective effectiveness of PI and MD as well as the superiority of PIMD over competing ICA methods. Moreover, MD can improve the performance of other ICA methods as well.",

        "abstract": "We propose a simulation method for multidimensional Hawkes processes based on superposition theory of point processes. This formulation allows us to design efficient simulations for Hawkes processes with differing exponentially decaying intensities. We demonstrate that inter-arrival times can be decomposed into simpler auxiliary variables that can be sampled directly, giving exact simulation with no approximation. We establish that the auxiliary variables provides information on the parent process for each event time. The algorithm correctness is shown by verifying the simulated intensities with their theoretical moments.  A modular inference procedure consisting of a combination between Gibbs through the adaptive rejection sampling and Metropolis Hastings steps is presented. Finally, we compare our proposed simulation method against existing methods, and find significant improvement in terms of algorithm speed. Our inference algorithm is used to discover the strengths of mutually excitations in real dark networks.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new HDP based online review rating regression model named Topic-Sentiment-Preference Regression Analysis (TSPRA). TSPRA combines topics (i.e. product as-pects), word sentiment and user preference as regression factors, and is able to perform topic clus-tering, review rating prediction, sentiment analysis and what we invent as \u201ccritical aspect\u201d analysis altogether in one framework. TSPRA extends sentiment approaches by integrating the key concept \u201cuser preference\u201d in collaborative filtering (CF) models into consideration, while it is distinct from current CF models by decoupling \u201cuser preference\u201d and \u201csentiment\u201d as independent factors. Our experiments conducted on 22 Amazon datasets show overwhelming better performance in rating predication against a state-of-art model FLAME (2015) in terms of error, Pearson\u2019s Correlation and number of inverted pairs. For sentiment analysis, we compare the derived word sentiments against a public sentiment resource SenticNet3 and our sentiment estimations clearly make more sense in the context of online reviews. Last, as a result of the de-correlation of \u201cuser preference\u201d from \u201csentiment\u201d, TSPRA is able to evaluate a new concept \u201ccritical aspects\u201d, defined as the prod-uct aspects seriously concerned by users but negatively commented in reviews. Improvement to such \u201ccritical aspects\u201d could be most effective to enhance user experience.",
